A facile and general strategy is developed to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (denoted as M‐CCPA, M = Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) that can markedly increase the accessibility of their well‐defined single‐atom metal sites within their hierarchically porous structures with mesopores and nanopores, which can provide a wide space for the design of high‐performance catalysts toward various energy‐conversion systems.








Abstract
Developing high‐performance single‐atom catalysts (SACs) with maximum metal utilization efficiency is of significance, which presents enormous potentials to be extensively applied. It is desired yet challenging to elaborately tailor the coordination structures of active sites in SACs and simultaneously enable sufficient accessibility of these active sites to reactants. Here, a facile and general strategy to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (CCPA) with porous architectures that can markedly increase the accessibility of their elaborately‐tailored active sites, which as a new electrocatalyst paradigm can fully present both the structural advantages of SACs and aerogel materials, is reported. Taking nickel (Ni) as an example, Ni‐based CCPA (Ni‐CCPA) and its counterpart Ni‐CCP with non‐aerogel feature are studied as a proof‐of‐concept case. Electrochemical measurements show that, relative to Ni‐CCP, Ni‐CCPA exhibits appreciably higher performance toward alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both the experimental results and theoretical simulations unravel that the improved OER performance of Ni‐CCPA arises from the accelerated OH− diffusion within its porous architecture and enhanced OH− concentration near its highly exposed active sites at its high‐curvature surfaces with localized electric fields. Importantly, as evidenced by the Cu‐CCPA and Zn‐CCPA examples, such strategy can be promisingly applied to prepare high‐performance CCPA targeted toward various catalytic reactions and beyond.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

GO naturally adsorbs onto the surface of LMPs via electrostatic interactions, self‐assembles into a core–shell structure, and subsequently reduces to RGO in an acidic solution. The presence of RGO in the hierarchical structural composites significantly improves the electrode‐electrolyte interface, suppressing and accommodating the irregular deformation of LMPs during the electrochemical reaction process and promoting the formation of a stable SEI film.









Abstract
Gallium‐based liquid metal (LM) has emerged as a promising candidate anode material for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting high theoretical capacity, excellent electrode kinetics, and unique self‐healing ability. However, the liquid‐solid‐liquid transition during the electrochemical reactions can disrupt the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and damage the structural integrity, ultimately limiting the cycling stability. Here, hierarchical‐structured reduced graphene oxide coated eutectic gallium‐indium liquid metal particles (RGO@EGaIn LMPs) are synthesized using a facile self‐assembly strategy. The customized RGO@EGaIn electrode demonstrated impressive performance in both half‐cell and full‐cell configurations for LIBs. The morphological and phase transitions of RGO@EGaIn LMPs during the lithiation/delithiation processes are uncovered by real‐time in situ transmission electron microscopy tests. It is clarified that the presence of RGO in the hierarchical structure buffers the volume expansion of LMPs from ≈160% to 125% and provides a fast pathway for the rapid transfer of ions and electrons during the electrochemical reaction, which effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of the electrode. This work introduces a straightforward and effective method for preparing high‐performance room‐temperature liquid metal electrodes, representing a significant step forward toward the commercial application of liquid metal batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is prepared for the efficient production of H2 and high‐selectivity value‐added chemicals from waste plastic. The catalyst exhibits high H2 production rates of 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g−1 h−1, along with selectivities of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from PLA and PET, respectively.








Abstract
The oxidative degradation of plastics in conjunction with the production of clean hydrogen (H2) represents a significant challenge. Herein, a Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is rationally synthesized and employed for the efficient production of H2 and high‐selectivity value‐added chemicals from waste plastic. By integrating spectroscopic analysis techniques with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a solely electron transfer‐mediated reaction mechanism is confirmed, wherein Ni3S4 extracts electrons from ZnCdS (ZCS) to promote the spatial segregation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which not only facilitates H2 production but also maintains the high oxidation potential of holes on the ZCS surface, favoring hole‐dominated plastic oxidation. Notably, the catalyst exhibited efficient H2 production rates as high as 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g−1 h−1, along with a selectivity of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), respectively. Additionally, carbon yields of 26.5% for pyruvate and 2.2% for acetate are measured after 9 h of photoreforming, representing the highest values reported to date. Overall, this research presents a promising approach for converting plastic waste into H2 fuel and high‐selectivity valuable chemical products, offering a potential solution to the growing issue of “White Pollution”.

2D polymeric C60 is an emerging all‐carbon semiconductor possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. A hydrogen‐assisted electrochemical strategy has been developed to produce gram‐scale large size (≈52.5 µm2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (≈83%). The thin‐film photodetectors demonstrate broad spectral response from visible light to near‐infrared region.








Abstract
2D polymeric fullerene scaffolds, composed of covalently bonded superatomic C60 nanoclusters, are emerging semiconductors possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. Hitherto their synthesis has relied on complex and time‐consuming reactions, thereby hindering scalable production and limiting the technological relevance. Here, the study demonstrates a facile electrochemical exfoliation strategy based on the intercalation and expansion of a layered fullerene superlattice, to produce large size (≈52.5 µm2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (≈83%). In situ reduction of solvated protons (H+) weakens the interlayer interactions thereby promoting the rapid and uniform intercalation of tetra‐n‐butylammonium (TBA+), ensuring gram‐scale throughput and high structural integrity of exfoliated 2D polymeric C60. As a proof of concept, the solution‐processed 2D polymeric C60 nanosheets have been integrated into thin‐film photodetectors, exhibiting a broad spectral photoresponse ranging from 405 to 1200 nm, with a peak photocurrent at 850 nm and a stable response time. This efficient and scalable exfoliation method holds great promise for the advancement of multifunctional composites and optoelectronic devices based on 2D polymeric C60.

<title>Radical Molecular Network‐Buffer Minimizes Photovoltage Loss in FAPbI₃ Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

An in situ polymerizable radical molecule (ATEMPO) preferentially interacting with the {111}c facets, is employed as an additive to promote perovskite crystal growth. During annealing, ATEMPO polymerizes, forming a network‐buffer that mitigates lattice strain and suppresses intragrain planar defects. This strategy yields high‐quality perovskite films, achieving a champion PCE of 25.28% with a remarkably high VOC of 1.203 V, minimizing photovoltage loss in FAPbI₃ perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI₃) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold immense potential for high‐efficiency photovoltaics, but maximizing their open‐circuit voltage (VOC) remains challenging. Targeting the inherently stable {111}c‐dominant facets is a promising approach for enhancing stability, but their formation typically suffers from high defect densities and disordered growth. This study introduces a novel approach using an in situ polymerizable radical molecule, ATEMPO, as an additive to address these issues. ATEMPO preferentially interacts with the {111}c perovskite facets, guiding their growth and forming a “radical molecular network‐buffer” upon polymerization. The network effectively mitigates lattice strain, suppresses defect formation, enhances charge transport via redox‐mediated hopping, and provides a hydrophobic barrier, significantly improving moisture resistance. This strategy yields high‐quality, {111}c ‐oriented FAPbI₃ films, leading to a champion PCE of 25.28% with a remarkably high VOC of 1.203 V, corresponding to an energy loss (Eloss) of only 0.297 eV, among the highest VOC reported for FAPbI₃‐based PSCs. Furthermore, a mini‐module fabricate with an active area of 12.5 cm2 achieve a high PCE of 21.39%. the work paves the way for developing high‐performance, stable PSCs with minimized photovoltage loss. Furthermore, it offers a promising strategy to enhance device longevity and address environmental concerns.

Induced pluripotent stem cell membrane is coated onto adjuvant‐loaded nanoparticle cores to create a universal cancer vaccine. The formulation utilizes oncofetal antigens present on the cell membrane to elicit broadly protective immune responses in vivo. The enhanced immunity generated by the nanovaccine enables robust prophylactic efficacy against multiple murine tumor models.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines are a promising immunotherapeutic modality that function by training the immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells. As tumor‐specific and tumor‐associated antigens generally cannot be identified until after a tumor has already been established, these vaccines must be applied therapeutically when strong immunosuppressive mechanisms are already in place. Building upon previous work using cell membrane coating nanotechnology, the development of a broad‐spectrum prophylactic cancer nanovaccine that consists of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) membrane coated around an adjuvant‐loaded nanoparticle core is shown. The resulting nanostructure is capable of presenting iPSC‐derived oncofetal antigens, which are oftentimes re‐expressed on cancer cells but lowly present on normal adult tissues. When administered in vivo, the iPSC membrane‐coated nanoparticles are highly immunostimulatory and elicit strong antitumor immunity that can successfully inhibit the growth of multiple tumor types, including five different murine tumor models and in a bilaterial heterogeneous tumor model. Overall, this work demonstrates an effective approach for engineering iPSC‐based nanovaccines that can be applied broadly to prevent cancer before it occurs.

A novel single‐atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3−δ (BCF) perovskite, develope via a scalable solid‐state approach, forms a distinctive 4‐coordinate Ru–O–Fe configuration that induces reverse hydrogen spillover and promotes proton‐involved oxygen reduction. The optimized 2Ru‐BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode based fuel cell delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.78 W cm−2 at 700 °C with stable operation for 200 h.









Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) offer a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, however, their commercial potential is hindered by sluggish proton‐involved oxygen reduction reaction (P‐ORR) kinetics and inadequate durability of cathode materials. Here, a novel single‐atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3−δ (BCF) perovskite, synthesized by a facile and scalable solid‐state approach, as a potential cathode for PCFCs is reported. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the single‐atom Ru on BCF, characterized by a unique 4‐coordinate Ru‐O‐Fe configuration, not only induces reverse hydrogen spillover but also acts as an active site for P‐ORR. The application of the optimized 2Ru‐BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode in a single cell delivers an exceptional peak power density of 1.78 W cm−2 at 700 °C, along with excellent operational stability over 200 h. These findings provide new insights into single‐atom engineering, advancing the commercial viability of PCFCs.

<title>Organic Gradient Homojunction via D‐A Engineering Enables Photoelectric/Photothermal Dual‐Assisted Catalysis Toward Full Spectrum Light‐Coupled Low‐Temperature Seawater Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

An organic gradient homojunction design via rational donor–acceptor engineering is proposed to establish a new class of full‐spectrum responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode for solar‐coupled seawater‐electrolyte‐based metal‐air flow batteries with improved solar utilization and device energy efficiency even at lower temperatures, by exploring photoelectric/photothermal dual‐assisted bidirectional oxygen catalysis.








Abstract
Coupling solar into metal‐air batteries represents an appealing paradigm for storing intermittent solar energy and boosting device energy efficiency. Current solar‐coupled metal‐air systems rely on UV or visible light harvesting and suffer from inferior charge separation ability and limited solar utilization. Additionally, sunlight action behavior/mechanism in some useful scenarios (seawater electrolytes, low‐temperature) is underexplored. Herein, through gradient homojunction design via donor‐acceptor (D‐A) engineering, it exploits a novel full‐spectrum‐responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode (PGH) for sunlight‐coupled seawater‐electrolyte‐based Zn/Na‐air batteries (Zn‐SWAB/Na‐SWAB) with boosted sunlight utilization and energy efficiency at lower temperatures. By stacking three pre‐designed analogous [A1‐D1]m‐[A1‐D2]n copolymers with gradient energy‐levels and rich heterocycles, PGH integrates separate metal‐free active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), efficient photothermal effect with full‐spectrum‐absorption, and superior photoelectric effect with high charge‐separation efficiency. Thus, PGH under simulated‐sunlight produces remarkably‐enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near‐neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight‐coupled PGH‐enabled Zn‐SWAB and Na‐SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25 V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43 V at 0 °C – both of which surpass most reported room‐temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0 °C even approach their room‐temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual‐promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

A water‐soluble Pt(II) pincer complex probe is proposed to achieve the direct recognition of anionic [UO2(CO3)3]4− using a new strategy where the overlapping of thick hydration shells drives an assembly. This hydration‐shell‐promoted assembly endows the probe with excellent specificity, a rapid response, and high sensitivity (14.89 fg). This study paves the way for exploring new approaches for the direct detection of highly hydrated ions.








Abstract
It is still challenging to directly recognize the anionic species [UO2(CO3)3]4−, the dominant species in the environment (82%‐93%), using current optical probes because of the adverse effects of its thick hydration shell on binding interactions. In this study, a water‐soluble Pt(II) methylated terpyridine complex ([Pt(CH3‐tpy)NCO]+) supramolecular probe is designed to directly target [UO2(CO3)3]4− by a new strategy of thick hydration shell overlapping arrangement. The optical response demonstrates excellent selectivity among ≈30 investigated interfering substances, along with rapid response (≈15 s), high sensitivity (64.1 nm) and dual‐signals. It is confirmed both experimentally and theoretically that the superior detection performance is attributed to the formation of a unique supramolecular structure featuring biplane‐like building block, bicolumnar stacking and water‐bridged anionic networks, via the overlap of thick hydration shells of aligned [UO2(CO3)3]4− to boost a superentropic driving force, and the distinguishable dual‐signals arises from the emergence of four types of Pt‐Pt interactions, generating low‐energy metal‐to‐metal charge transfer adsorption/emission. In addition, a [Pt(CH3‐tpy)NCO]+‐based hydrogel platform is constructed for detecting both anionic and cationic uranium, with a detection limit of 14.89 fg. This work unlocks not only a way to directly detect [UO2(CO3)3]4−, but also a new idea for sensing ions with extreme thick hydration layers.

<title>Point Defects Enhance Cross‐Plane Thermal Conductivity In Graphite</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Point defects typically reduce thermal conductivity (κ) by scattering heat‐carrying phonons. However, introducing spiro interstitials through particle irradiation in graphite surprisingly increases cross‐plane κ from 10.8 to 18.9 W m K−1 at room temperature. The scanning transmission electron microscope and first‐principles calculations reveal that these defects bridge graphene planes, increasing group velocity while reducing phonon‐phonon scattering, thereby enhancing cross‐plane κ of graphite.








Abstract
Point defects typically reduce the thermal conductivity (κ) of a crystal due to increased scattering of heat‐carrying phonons, a mechanism that is well understood and widely used to enhance or impede heat transfer in the material for different applications. Here an opposite effect is reported where the introduction of point defects in graphite with energetic particle irradiation increases its cross‐plane κ by nearly a factor of two, from 10.8 to 18.9 W m K−1 at room temperature. Integrated differential phase contrast imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the creation of spiro interstitials in graphite by the irradiation. The enhancement in κ is attributed to a remarkable mechanism that works to the benefit of phonon propagation in both the harmonic and anharmonic terms: these spiro interstitial defects covalently bridge neighboring basal planes, simultaneously enhancing acoustic phonon group velocity and reducing phonon–phonon scattering in the graphite structure. The enhancement of κ reveals an unconventional role of lattice defects in heat conduction, i.e., easing the propagation of heat‐carrying phonons rather than impeding them in layered materials, inspiring their applications for thermal management in heavily radiative environments.

<title>Interlocking Antiphase Boundary with 180° Domain Wall in PbTiO3 – Antiphase Ferroelectric Boundary</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

This study explores the potential applications of antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the interlocking feature between antiphase boundaries and 180° conventional domain walls. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
The ferroelectric domain wall, serving as the boundary between separate data carriers based on domains, has attracted widespread interest due to its distinctive physical properties. Although the domain walls in ferroelectric materials are narrower than those in magnetic materials due to their higher lattice anisotropy, they still account for a considerable proportion in ultrathin films, reducing storage efficiency to some extent. Here, ultrathin antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) are presented and validated their feasibility as ferroelectric domain walls. The naturally formed APFB shows a sharp and straight morphology, with the characteristic of interlocking between the antiphase boundary (APB) and conventional 180° domain wall. The calculations from the density functional theory demonstrate that the APFBs undergo a significant but localized change in electronic structure. They largely retain the characteristics that are consistent with those of conventional domain walls, such as enhanced conductivity, irregular oxygen vacancy trapping energy, and vacancy‐tunable physical properties. Finally, as techniques for precisely controlling the nucleation of APB developing, configurations with out‐of‐plane APFBs used as dividers may provide a promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

A twisted guest acceptor BTP‐4Cl is introduced to fine‐tune the solubility of host components to address the excessive aggregation issue in blade‐coated processing. It is found that the twisted molecular conformation profited in inducing longer intermolecular distance and dispersing molecular distribution in the solvent. Simultaneously, the guest acceptor positively influenced the crystalization kinetics by providing nuclei seeding sites. Finally, a fine phase separation is achieved in the open‐air blade‐coated organic solar cells with a state‐of‐the‐art power conversion efficiency of 19.67%.









Abstract
Blade coating is a promising tool for upscaling organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the performances of blade‐coated OSCs still lag behind their spin‐coated counterparts, limiting their competitive edge towards commercialization. One of the main reasons is that controlling the film aggregation kinetics and morphology becomes challenging during the transition from spin coating to blade coating, especially when using high boiling point solvents, which can result in excessive aggregation. Therefore, a deeper understanding and appraisal of film formation kinetics influenced by coating methods is crucial. In this work, it is demonstrated that ink solubility tuning by incorporating a twisted third component (BTP‐4Cl) can induce rapid crystallization behavior and promote fine phase separation between the donor polymer (PM6) and the acceptor (BTP‐eC9) in blade coating. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.67% is obtained in OSCs (0.04 cm2), one of the state‐of‐the‐art efficiencies among the reported blade‐coated OSCs (19.76% for the spin‐coated devices). In addition, it is found that the inhibited phase aggregation contributes to enhancing the light stability of the device. This strategy offered novel insights into the effectiveness of solubility‐tuning approaches for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs under open‐air coating conditions.

This study presents the synthesis of mitochondrion‐targeted nanodrugs containing a BODIPY‐derived type I photosensitizer and a dual nanozyme for light‐controlled mitochondrial stress‐inducing and agonist‐independent cGAS‐STING pathway activation. Their tumor therapeutic ability, dual nanozyme activities, mitochondrion‐targeted cGAS‐STING pathway activation, and intratumoral and systemic immunositimulation capacity underscore their potential as a paradigm for efficient photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
CGAS‐STING agonists generally lead to hyperimmunity and systemic toxicity, hindering their immunotherapeutic outcomes. Herein, a mitochondrion‐targeted nanoagonist (termed HABH) containing boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)‐derived type I photosensitizer (BDP) and Au nanoparticle‐engineered hollow mesoporous silica (HMSN/AuNPs) has been fabricated for light‐controlled mitochondrial stress‐inducing and agonist‐independent cGAS‐STING pathway activation. The HABH nanoagonist can actively target tumor tissues and release the mitochondrion‐targeted BDP. Under light illumination, BDP achieves type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) in mitochondria, generating massive hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and inducing mitochondrial stress in an oxygen‐independent manner, promoting the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Simultaneously, the HMSN/AuNPs act as dual nanozymes to derive cascade reactions for •OH production, elevating the intracellular oxidative state, and together with the BDP‐induced mitochondrial stress, finally evoking the cGAS‐STING pathway and facilitating the release of type I interferon. In the orthotopic breast tumor models, the HABH nanoagonist achieved intratumoral and systemic immunoactivation for eradicating primary tumors and preventing metastasis tumors. Therefore, the constructed mitochondrion‐targeted nanoagonist enabled light‐controlled and agonist‐independent cGAS‐STING activation, providing a paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

This work uses ligand‐based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct a high‐throughput screening platform, which can be used to identify small molecule combinations with potential co‐assembly ability.








Abstract
Co‐assembled nanodrugs provide significant advantages in cancer treatment and drug delivery, yet effective screening methods to identify molecular combinations for co‐assembly are lacking. This study presents a screening strategy integrating ligand‐based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore new molecular combinations with co‐assembly capabilities. The accuracy of this screening was validated by synthesizing various co‐assembled nanodrugs under mild conditions. Vinpocetine (Vin) and lenvatinib (Len) are representative co‐assembly combinations that can directly co‐assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and π‐π interactions. These NPs were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in PEG‐L/V NPs that exhibited enhanced stability and biocompatibility. In addition, PEG‐L/V NPs can respond to acidic conditions and release Vin and Len, working synergistically to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro while also inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) analysis revealed that the co‐assembled nanodrugs exhibited mechanisms that are distinct from those of single drugs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a computational approach combining LBVS and DFT to identify small molecules with co‐assembly capabilities, leading to innovative anticancer strategies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

The covalent warhead alkynamide is incorporated into an aggregation‐induced emission photosensitizer, developing a redox systems‐targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP‐PA. It is aimed at disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system, alleviating hypoxia, and evoking ferroptosis‐ and pyroptosis‐mediated immunotherapy by thiol‐yne click reactions. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP‐PA‐NPs at the tumor led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non‐invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor‐associated antigens and damage‐associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP‐PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis‐ and pyroptosis‐mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol‐yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non‐covalent photosensitizer MBTP‐A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti‐tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP‐PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol‐yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Proquinoidal building blocks are demonstrated that could enable a narrow bandgap while facilitating the delocalization of both positive and negative polarons, making them ideal for high‐performance ambipolar OECTs. Using this strategy, a record‐breaking ambipolar OECT material featuring high µC*, low operating voltage, and rapid response is developed.








Abstract
Ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) can simplify manufacturing processes and reduce device footprints, yet their performance still lags behind their p‐type and n‐type counterparts due to limited molecular design strategies. Here, incorporating strong proquinoidal building blocks effectively addresses this challenge is demonstrated. Using a computational acceptor screening approach, three TBDOPV‐based polymers are designed and synthesized: P(bgTBDOPV‐T), P(bgTBDOPV‐EDOT), and P(bgTBDOPV‐MeOT2), all exhibiting ambipolar behavior across various donor moieties. Remarkably, P(bgTBDOPV‐EDOT) achieves record‐high figure‐of‐merit (µC*) values, reaching 268 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for p‐type and 107 F cm−1 V−1 s−1 for n‐type operations. Additionally, P(bgTBDOPV‐EDOT) exhibits low operation voltages (VTh,p = −0.55 V and VTh,n = 0.32 V), with fast response times (τon/τoff = 0.48/0.36 ms for p‐type and 0.41/0.41 ms for n‐type) and enhanced operational stability. Inverter devices based on P(bgTBDOPV‐EDOT) show high voltage gains of 173 V/V. Theoretical calculations and data analysis confirm that strong proquinoidal acceptors significantly enhance the delocalization of both positive and negative polarons, offering an effective pathway for higher‐performance ambipolar OECT materials.

<title>Homo‐Hetero Double Junction Coupling Weakens Exciton Effects to Enhance Selective Photocatalytic O2 Activation on Carbon Nitride</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Through the homo‐hetero double‐junction coupling strategy, the directional electron–hole migration is precisely regulated, and the exciton effect is substantially weakened. Under the strong built‐in electric field, the FO/HCCN surface exhibits typical charge‐carrier behavior, which achieves ≈100% selective generation of ·O2− from O2.








Abstract
Exciton effects caused by the inherent dielectric confinement in the 2D material carbon nitride (CN) severely limit the transfer of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of free radicals. Herein, a homo‐hetero double junction coupling strategy is reported to address these challenges. Ternary homojunction carbon nitride (HCCN) functionalized with cyano and cyanamide groups is constructed with a built‐in electric field that efficiently separates the electron–hole into different structural units, thereby reducing reverse charge recombination and weakening exciton effects. The introduction of α‐Fe2O3 (FO) subsequently constructs the homo‐hetero double junction catalyst FO/HCCN with a built‐in electric field 127 times stronger than HCCN, which promotes the directional migration of carriers after exciton dissociation and achieves ≈100% selective generation of ·O2− from O2. These results suggest that FO/HCCN achieves 99.6% removal of tetracycline within 20 min, with a degradation rate 12 and 46 times higher than FO/CN and HCCN, respectively. In addition, the system shows excellent stability and cyclability in real‐life light experiments and trace organic contaminant removal. This homo‐hetero double junction coupling strategy opens up new avenues in weakening exciton effects and precisely controlling the generation of free radicals.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

A covalent organic framework (COF) with a diselenide bond is rationally designed as a radioactive PANoptosis inducer to potentiate tumor radiosensitivity. This diselenide COF effectively promotes the formation of Z‐DNA, and reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of radiotherapy, and making it a promising candidate for cancer treatment.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous crystals of high potential in biomedical applications. The chemical bonds within COF structures are critical for the overall therapeutic performance. Here, the design and synthesis of radioactive COF are reported by introducing labile diselenide bonds into the structure backbone. This diselenide bonded COF, PorSe‐CuPt, constructed from Cu and Pt ion porphyrin units, is capable of bond cleavage upon irradiation, thus releasing the drug molecule, CBL0137, carried in the pores. Concerted with the promotion of X‐ray absorption by Pt2⁺ and the enrichment of oxygen by Cu2⁺, robust PANoptosis is achieved as well as improved immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby drastically enhancing the overall effectiveness of radiotherapy. The integration of diselenide bonds into the COF backbone demonstrates the possible application of clip‐off chemistry in the search for highly responsible and compatible biomaterials.

<title>Directly Printed 3D Soft Microwave Plasmonic Enhanced‐Q Resonators by Decoupling from Lossy Media</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Traditional 2D plasmonic resonators are limited to be employed onto soft electronic platforms owing to the attenuation caused by lossy media. To overcome this, directly printed 3D plasmonic resonator configurations are developed with highly conductive elastomeric composites. These 3D soft resonators demonstrate wireless, multidirectional strain‐sensing capabilities with higher quality factor resonances than their 2D counterparts, enabling advanced sensing applications.









Abstract
Soft electronic components are essential building blocks for realizing form‐factor‐free applications; however, most designs are confined to 2D or 2.5D structures due to challenges in maintaining 3D structural integrity. This limitation is particularly critical for electromagnetic devices, such as resonators, where dielectric losses from elastomeric substrates severely hinder high‐performance functionality. Here, directly printed 3D electromagnetic soft plasmonic enhanced‐quality(Q) factor resonators are proposed, using highly conductive composites. By incorporating an immiscible solvent into an elastomer matrix, emulsion phases are formed that significantly enhance the storage modulus, enabling the fabrication of 3D‐printed structures while improving their electrical conductivity. 3D microwave plasmonic resonators with a high degree of design freedom, such as pillars and hooks are demonstrated. These structures exhibit improved resistance to dielectric interference by leveraging the resonance in lossless air. Moreover, integrating a coplanar ground plane further decouples the resonators from lossy substrates, resulting in a 3.4‐fold enhancement in the Q‐factor (octupole mode) compared to 2D resonators. This improvement enables stable operation on high‐permittivity surfaces, such as human skin. Additionally, a single 3D resonator demonstrates wireless deformation‐sensing capabilities, facilitating the simultaneous detection of strain amplitude and orientation. This result can pave the way for advanced sensing applications in soft electronics.

<title>A Universal Solution for Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium Iron Phosphate</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Design criteria for a lithiation solution that enables spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions for the direct regeneration of spent LiFePO4 are proposed. Using machine learning (ML), the redox potentials of various solution systems are identified and revealed a critical relationship: the lower the redox potential, the more effective the lithiation of degraded LiFePO4 materials.








Abstract
Lithiation reactions driven by chemical potential offer a promising avenue for directly regenerating degraded lithium iron phosphate (LFP). However, the choice of solution system significantly influences the lithium supplementation where improper selection may result in poor lithium recovery or extremely slow kinetics. Herein, it is identified that the most critical factor affecting solution repair effectiveness is the redox potential of the anions in the solution, which determines whether spent LFP (SLFP) can undergo spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions. Then, machine learning (ML) is used for prediction and screening of huge potential solution systems, and finally a general strategy is proposed: creating a low redox potential solution system that incorporates anions with either low redox potential or moderate redox potential at high concentrations. As a demonstration, the regenerated LFP by ascorbic acid and LiOH solution systems exhibits a high discharge capacity of 144 mAh g−1 at 1 C, retaining 96% of its capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C. This work establishes an important criteria for designing solution systems to restore degraded LFP, marking a significant advancement in the direct regeneration of cathode materials from spent lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

This work describes a few‐shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network to automatically analyze a library of atomic structures (vacancies, grain boundaries, stacking configurations, etc.) represented by graphs. This framework significantly promotes robustness, reduces computing parameters by three orders of magnitude compared to the image‐driven learning framework, and facilitates new structure and knowledge discovery.








Abstract
The emergence of deep learning (DL) has provided great opportunities for the high‐throughput analysis of atomic‐resolution micrographs. However, the DL models trained by image patches in fixed size generally lack efficiency and flexibility when processing micrographs containing diversified atomic configurations. Herein, inspired by the similarity between the atomic structures and graphs, a few‐shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to analyze a library of atomic structures (e.g., vacancies, phases, grain boundaries, doping, etc.) is described, showing significantly promoted robustness and three orders of magnitude reduced computing parameters compared to the image‐driven DL models, which is especially evident for those aggregated vacancy lines with flexible lattice distortion. Besides, the intuitiveness of graphs enables quantitative and straightforward extraction of the atomic‐scale structural features in batches, thus statistically unveiling the self‐assembly dynamics of vacancy lines under electron beam irradiation. A versatile model toolkit is established by integrating EGNN sub‐models for single structure recognition to process images involving varied configurations in the form of a task chain, leading to the discovery of novel doping configurations with superior electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. This work provides a powerful tool to explore structure diversity in a fast, accurate, and intelligent manner.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

This study presents a novel bioscaffold combining recombinant human collagen XVII (rhCOL17) with porphyra‐334 (P334) to create a transparent, injectable hydrogel (GCP) for enhanced wound healing. GCP integrates extracellular matrix‐like cues with UVA shielding properties, preventing fibroblast senescence and improving repair outcomes. This platform offers significant potential for advanced, protective wound management.








Abstract
Wound healing remains a significant global health challenge, affecting millions annually and imposing substantial economic burdens. Most commercially available biomaterials for wound management primarily address external symptoms, including hemostasis, exudation, scarring, and infection. Advanced biomaterials derived from endogenous molecules aim to better replicate the native wound microenvironment, promoting enhanced repair. Since wounds frequently occur on exposed skin, which is vulnerable to UVA radiation and requires protective yet invisible materials, traditional wound care products often lack these essential features. Inspired by natural UV protection mechanisms, a novel bioscaffold is developed using recombinant human collagen XVII (rhCOL17) crosslinked with porphyra‐334 (P334) to improve wound healing under UVA exposure. The resulting rhCOL17‐P334 conjugate integrates extracellular matrix (ECM)‐like cues with UVA‐shielding properties provided by P334. This conjugate is used to construct a transparent, injectable hydrogel combining gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and rhCOL17‐P334 (GCP). GCP significantly inhibits UVA‐induced fibroblast senescence and improves wound healing outcomes by targeting integrin α6β4 through rhCOL17. Its transparency facilitates convenient wound monitoring while also addressing the aesthetic requirement for invisibility. By combining UVA shielding with wound repair capabilities, GCP presents a promising platform for advanced wound management.

<title>Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.








Abstract
Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field. The theoretical and experimental results for electric conduction can directly be transferred to thermal conduction or particle diffusion and may enable remote sensing applications.

To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural ion channels, this research presents a novel butterfly‐shaped bionic K+ transmembrane channel GnC7 (n = 3, 4) with record‐breaking K+/Na+ selectivity. The unique mobile channels constructed from poly (propylene imine) dendritic polymers and benzo‐21‐crown‐7‐ethers exhibit dual mechanical and pH responsiveness in liposomes/cells. Drastic G4C7‐induced intracellular K+ efflux effectively activates mitochondrial‐ and ER‐associated apoptosis.








Abstract
To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural multi‐gated ion channels, a novel butterfly‐shaped biomimetic K+ channel GnC7 (n = 3, 4) is developed with dual mechanical and pH responsiveness, exhibiting unprecedented K+/Na+ selectivity (G3C7: 34.4; G4C7: 41.3). These channels constructed from poly(propylene imine) dendrimer and benzo‐21‐crown‐7‐ethers achieve high K+ transport activity (EC50: 0.72 µm for G3C7; 0.9 µm for G4C7) due to their arc‐like mechanical rotation. The dynamic mode relies on butterfly‐shaped topology derived from the highly symmetrical core and multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds. GnC7 can sense mechanical stimulus applied to liposomes/cells and then adapt the K+ transport rate accordingly. Furthermore, reversible ON/OFF switching of K+ transport is realized through the pH‐controllable host‐guest complexation. G4C7‐induced ultrafast cellular K+ efflux (70% within only 9 min) efficiently triggers mitochondrial‐dependent apoptosis of cancer cells by provoking endoplasmic reticulum stress accompanied by drastic Ca2+ sparks. This work embodies a multi‐dimensional regulation of channel functions; it will provide insights into the dynamic behaviors of biological analogs and promote the innovative design of artificial ion channels and therapeutic agents.

<title>Generating Self‐Adjuvated Nanofiber Vaccines by Coating Bacterial Flagella with Antigens</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coating bacterial flagella with antigens is used as a versatile platform for developing self‐adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. The resulting flagellum‐based subunit vaccines with appealing features in prolonging tumor retention, recruiting adequate immune cells, and promoting cellular uptake of antigens and subsequent activation of antigen‐presenting cells provide a unique paradigm for effective vaccination.








Abstract
Bacteria‐based vaccines have received increasing attention given the ability to induce strong systemic immune responses. However, the application of bacteria as therapeutic agents inevitably suffers from infection‐associated side effects due to the living characteristics. Here, the use of bacteria‐derived flagella is described to construct self‐adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. With the help of charge‐reversal mediated by decoration with cationic polymers, the flagella can be coated with negatively charged antigens through electrostatic interaction. By virtue of the large aspect ratio, the resulting nanofiber vaccines show prolonged retention at the injection site and increased uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. Thanks to the innate immunogenicity, self‐adjuvated flagella robustly promote dendritic cell maturation and macrophage polarization, resulting in the elicitation of antigen‐specific T‐cell and B‐cell immune responses. In ovalbumin‐overexpressing melanoma‐bearing mice, immunization with ovalbumin‐carried vaccines not only exhibits a favorable tolerance, but also displays superior inhibition efficacies on tumor growth and metastasis separately under the therapeutic and prophylactic settings. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated for vaccine fabrication by coating with the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein S1 subunit. Bacterial flagella‐based self‐adjuvated nanofiber platform proposes a versatile strategy to develop various vaccines for disease prevention and treatment.

This work presents a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system featuring Cu2NCN as an efficient nitrate reduction (NO3RR) electrocatalyst, coupled with glycerol oxidation for low‐voltage, industrial‐level NH3 production. Achieving 4000 mA cm−2 at 2.52 V with sustained stability at 1000 mA cm−2 over 100 h, the system offers 83% Faradaic efficiency, with theoretical insights on NO₃* adsorption and O–N bond cleavage.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) holds significance in both NH3 synthesis and nitrate contamination remediation. However, achieving industrial‐scale current and high stability in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer remains challenging due to inherent high full‐cell voltage for sluggish NO3RR and water oxidation. Here, Cu2NCN with positive surface electrostatic potential VS(r) is applied as highly efficient NO3RR electrocatalysts to achieve industrial‐current and low‐voltage stable NH3 production in MEA electrolyzer with coupled anodic glycerol oxidation. This paired electro‐refinery (PER) system reaches 4000 mA cm−2 at 2.52 V and remains stable at industrial‐level 1000 mA cm−2 for 100 h with the NH3 production rate of 97000 µgNH3 h−1 cm−2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 83%. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the asymmetric and electron‐withdrawing [N−C≡N] units enhance polarization and VS(r), promoting robust and asymmetric adsorption of NO3* on Cu2NCN to facilitate O−N bond dissociation. A comprehensive techno‐economic analysis demonstrates the profitability and commercial viability of this coupled system. Our work opens a new avenue and marks a significant advancement in MEA systems for industrial NH3 synthesis.

Abstract
The ever‐increasing demand for efficient data storage and processing has fueled the search for novel memory devices. By exploiting the spin‐to‐charge conversion phenomena, spintronics promises faster and low power solutions alternative to conventional electronics. In this work, a remarkable 34‐fold increase in spin‐to‐charge current conversion is demonstrated when incorporating a 2D epitaxial graphene monolayer between iron and platinum layers by exploring spin‐pumping on‐chip devices. Furthermore, it is found that the spin conversion is also anisotropic. This enhancement and anisotropy is attributed to the asymmetric Rashba contributions driven by an unbalanced spin accumulation at the differently hybridized top and bottom graphene interfaces, as highlighted by ad‐hoc first‐principles theory. The improvement in spin‐to‐charge conversion as well as its anisotropy reveals the importance of interfaces in hybrid 2D‐thin film systems, opening up new possibilities for engineering spin conversion in 2D materials, leading to potential advances in memory, logic applications, or unconventional computing.

Efficient storage and retrieval of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) data while maintaining scalability and stability remain challenges in the field of molecular data storage. This study introduces Engineered Living Memory Microspheroids (ELMMs), which combine genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) with matrix materials for DNA storage. The ELMM system improves random access and reduces data encapsulation time, offering scalable, closed‐loop storage and reuse.








Abstract
Given its exceptional durability and high information density, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has the potential to meet the escalating global demand for data storage if it can be stored efficiently and accessed randomly in exabyte‐to‐yottabyte‐scale databases. Here, this work introduces the Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid (ELMM) as a novel material for DNA data storage, retrieval, and management. This work engineers a plasmid library and devises a random access strategy pairing plasmid function with DNA data in a key‐value format. Each DNA segment is integrated with its corresponding plasmid, introduced into bacteria, and encapsulated within matrix material via droplet microfluidics within 5 min. ELMMs can be stored at room temperature following lyophilization and, upon rehydration, each type of ELMM exhibits specific functions expressed by the plasmids, allowing for physical differentiation based on these characteristics. This work demonstrates fluorescent expression as the plasmid function and employs fluorescence‐based sorting access image files in a prototype database. By utilizing N optical channels, to retrieve 2N file types, each with a minimum of 10 copies. ELMM offers a digital‐to‐biological information solution, ensuring the preservation, access, replication, and management of files within large‐scale DNA databases.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A series of novel arylamine‐linked and bipolar porous organic polymers (POPs) are designed and prepared as organic cathode materials for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). Benefiting from their high‐density redox‐active sites, bipolar feature, and arylamine linkage, these POPs exhibited high‐capacity, high‐rate, and excellent long‐term cycling stability as organic cathode materials for LIBs.








Abstract
Redox‐active porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as promising and sustainable organic cathode materials (OCMs) for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). However, their performance is significantly limited by insufficient redox‐active sites and low intrinsic conductivity. Herein, a series of novel arylamine‐linked and bipolar POPs (denoted as HATN‐AQ, HATN‐BQ, HATN‐CBD, and HATN‐PTO) are designed and prepared as OCMs for LIBs. Benefiting from their high density of redox‐active sites, bipolar feature, and arylamine linkage, these POPs exhibited high capacity, high rate, and excellent long‐term cycling stability. Among them, HATN‐PTO displayed an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 329.6 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 with a high energy density of 716.7 Wh kg−1, outstanding rate performance (208.7 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1), and superior cycling stability (188.9 mAh g−1 capacity retained after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1). Furthermore, the HATN‐PTO//graphite full battery exhibited a high specific capacity of 227.3 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and maintained a high capacity of 99.1 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g−1. Ex situ FT‐IR and XPS spectra combined with theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the dual‐ion storage mechanism. This work provides an effective strategy for designing POPs with high‐capacity and high‐rate for OCMs.

<title>CuPt Alloy Enabling the Tandem Catalysis for Reduction of HCOOH and NO3− to Urea at High Current Density</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrocatalytic liquid HCOOH and NO3− synthesis of urea with high Faraday efficiency at high current density is successfully achieved by synthesizing the Cu4Pt tandem catalyst loaded on copper foam. The doped Pt sites can enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form a large number of *CO key intermediates to lay the foundation for subsequent C─N coupling.








Abstract
The formation of urea by electrocatalytic reduction of C1‐reactants and NO3− is an attractive way to store renewable electricity, close the carbon cycle, and eliminate nitrate contaminants from wastewater. Involving insufficient supply of C1 reactants and multiple electron transfers makes the reaction difficult to achieve high Faraday efficiency and high yield at high current density. Here, a urea synthesis approach is presented via electrocatalytic reductive coupling between liquid HCOOH and NO3− on copper foam (CF) loaded Cu4Pt catalyst with optimized ratios. A urea yield of 40.08 mg h−1 cm−2 is achieved with FE up to 58.1% at a current density of −502.3 mA cm−2, superior to the productivity of previously reported catalysts. No degradation is observed over 120‐h continuous operation at such a high yield rate. The highly efficient activity of Cu4Pt/CF can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Pt and Cu sites via tandem catalysis, in which the doped Pt sites enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form and adsorb large amounts of *CO key intermediates. The Cu sites can generate large quantities of the key intermediate *NH2. The Cu4Pt/CF adsorbed intermediates *CO and *NH2 are the basis for subsequent thermodynamic spontaneous C─N coupling.

<title>High‐Entropy 1T‐Phase Quantum Sheets of Transition‐Metal Disulfides</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An efficient high‐entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T‐phase quantum sheets of transition‐metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in‐plane ordered carbide laminates (i‐MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high‐strained high‐entropy transition‐metal disulfides with 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T‐phase quantum sheets during the exfoliation process. The resultant 1T‐phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving good electrochemical properties in lithium‐sulfur batteries. 








Abstract
Quantum sheets of transition‐metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising nanomaterials owing to the combination of both 2D nanosheets and quantum dots with distinctive properties. However, the quantum sheets usually possess semiconducting behavior associated with 2H phase, it remains challenging to produce 1T‐phase quantum sheets due to the easy sliding of the basal plane susceptible to the small lateral sizes. Here, an efficient high‐entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T‐phase quantum sheets of transition‐metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in‐plane ordered carbide laminates (i‐MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high‐entropy transition‐metal disulfides with high strains and 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T‐phase quantum sheets with average size of 4.5 nm and thickness of 0.7 nm during the exfoliation process. Thus, the 1T‐phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving a good rate performance of 744 mAh g−1 at 5 C and a long cycle stability in lithium‐sulfur batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study investigates the internal and external cooling‐induced strains in monolayer MoSe2 at cryogenic temperatures, focusing on strain effects arising from thermal expansion coefficient mismatch at 2D‐bulk interfaces. Interface engineering demonstrates that compressive strain induces direct‐to‐indirect bandgap transitions. Notably, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation effectively mitigates external strain via 2D–2D interfaces, yielding performance comparable to suspended samples.








Abstract
2D materials exhibit unique properties for next‐generation electronics and quantum devices. However, their sensitivity to temperature variations, particularly concerning cooling‐induced strain, remains underexplored systematically. This study investigates the effects of cooling‐induced strain on monolayer MoSe2 at cryogenic temperatures. It is emphasized that the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between the material and bulk substrate leads to significant external strain, which superimposes the internal strain of the material. By engineering the material‐substrate 2D‐bulk interface, the resulting strain conditions are characterized and reveal that substantial compressive strain induces new emission features linked to direct‐to‐indirect bandgap transition, as confirmed by photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy studies. Finally, it is demonstrated that encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride can mitigate the external strain by 2D–2D interfaces, achieving results similar to those of suspended samples. The findings address key challenges in quantifying and characterizing strain types across different 2D‐bulk interfaces, distinguishing cooling‐induced strain effects from other temperature‐dependent phenomena, and designing strain‐sensitive 2D material devices for extreme temperature conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The epitaxial growth of hexagonal boron nitride (h‐BN) multilayer films on graphene, synthesized on a miscut SiC (0001) substrate, is demonstrated using nitrogen plasma‐assisted molecular‐beam epitaxy. Robust ferroelectricity with switchable out‐of‐plane polarization via interlayer sliding is supported by theoretical and experimental insights, providing a scalable pathway for integrating ferroelectric vdW materials into advanced 2D devices with diverse functionalities.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity realized in van der Waals (vdW) materials with non‐centrosymmetric stacking configurations holds promise for future 2D devices with nonvolatile and reconfigurable functionalities. However, the epitaxial growth of ferroelectric vdW materials often struggles to achieve an energetically unfavorable stacking configuration that enables electric polarization. This challenge is particularly evident when performing heteroepitaxy on another vdW substrate to create versatile and scalable ferroelectric building blocks designed for large‐area, atomic‐scale thicknesses. Here, epitaxial hexagonal boron nitride (h‐BN) multilayer films are successfully grew on single‐crystal graphene synthesized on a miscut SiC (0001) substrate. Theoretical calculations illustrate that the moiré‐patterned h‐BN/graphene hetero‐interface intrinsically exhibits polarization, leading to a polarized AB stacking in multilayer h‐BN films to minimize the total formation energy, which is validated experimentally by the layer‐dependent band dispersions. The as‐grown multilayer h‐BN layers demonstrated robust, homogeneous ferroelectricity with switchable out‐of‐plane polarization via interlayer sliding. This study establishes an effective route for stacking‐controlled heteroepitaxy, enabling the large‐scale integration of vdW materials with ferroelectricity and versatile functionalities, offering a promising platform for next‐generation 2D ferroelectric devices.

This perspective provides a systematic discussion on the challenges and solutions in designing materials for intrinsically stretchable organic light‐emitting diodes (ISOLEDs). It also highlights prospective challenges and offers insights into the development of highly efficient and stable ISOLEDs for practical applications.








Abstract
Wearable electronics require stretchable displays that can withstand large and repeated mechanical deformation without failure. Intrinsically stretchable organic light‐emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) that operate under DC voltage provide promising candidates for wearable display applications. However, the lack of sophisticated stretchable materials and processing techniques suitable for ISOLEDs results in a significant deficit in the efficiency of state‐of‐the‐art ISOLEDs compared to industrial standards. The design of stretchable conducting and semiconducting materials poses a significant challenge because of trade‐off relationships between stretchability and properties such as conductivity and charge carrier mobility. To increase the efficiency of ISOLEDs to meet industrial standards, strategies to overcome these trade‐offs must be developed. This perspective discusses recent progress and challenges in designing stretchable electrodes, light‐emitting materials, transport materials, and potential applications of ISOLEDs. It provides a useful guide in this field to develop efficient ISOLEDs for system‐level integration.

<title>Red Phosphorescence at Elevated Temperatures Enabled by Dexter Energy Transfer in Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon‐Xanthone Systems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pure Organic red persistent phosphorescent materials, possessing high‐temperature resistance and superior tissue penetration, can be efficiently fabricated using a host–guest doping strategy. The triplet‐to‐triplet Dexter energy transfer process plays a crucial role in modulating the luminescent properties of both the host and the guest. These materials hold promise for applications in advanced information encryption and bioimaging.








Abstract
Organic materials with red persistent phosphorescence hold immense promise for biotechnology due to their excellent tissue permeability and high signal‐to‐background ratios. However, inefficient spin‐orbit coupling, high triplet susceptibility, and narrow energy gapspromoted nonradiative deactivations, pose a formidable obstacle to achieving efficient red phosphorescence. This study addresses these challenges by introducing xanthone (Xan)‐based host–guest systems. Utilizing polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as guests, efficient red to near‐infrared (NIR) phosphorescent materials with ultralong lifetimes and high quantum yields of up to 821 ms and 2.32%, respectively, are successfully developed. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that Dexter energy transfer (DET) is the dominant mechanism responsible for red phosphorescence. This DET process between Xan and PAHs not only effectively utilizes the dark triplet state of the Xan host but also significantly enhances the triplet generation of the PAH guests, transforming them into potent phosphorescent luminophores. Furthermore, the inherent rigidity of Xan and PAHs endows the resulting materials with excellent phosphorescence performance, even at elevated temperatures (e.g., 423 K). This strategy, proven to be general, paves the way for designing efficient red/NIR phosphorescent materials through the DET mechanism, enabling their applications in molecular imaging and advanced high‐temperature encryption.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Liquid‐phase transmission electron microscopy enables visualization of nanoscale processes involving liquid media. Yet, it suffers from beam effects, such as radiolysis of the liquid, sample heating, and membrane charging. This review summarizes beam effect fundamentals, describes modeling and assessment, and illustrates handling strategies. The findings are transferable to other ionizing radiation techniques using, for example, γ‐ or X‐rays.








Abstract
The ionizing radiation harnessed in electron microscopes or synchrotrons enables unique insights into nanoscale dynamics. In liquid‐phase transmission electron microscopy (LP‐TEM), irradiating a liquid sample with electrons offers access to real space information at an unmatched combination of temporal and spatial resolution. However, employing ionizing radiation for imaging can alter the Gibbs free energy landscape during the experiment. This is mainly due to radiolysis and the corresponding shift in chemical potential; however, experiments can also be affected by irradiation‐induced charging and heating. In this review, the state of the art in describing beam effects is summarized, theoretical and experimental assessment guidelines are provided, and strategies to obtain quantitative information under such conditions are discussed. While this review showcases these effects on LP‐TEM, the concepts that are discussed here can also be applied to other types of ionizing radiation used to probe liquid samples, such as synchrotron X‐rays.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Metal‐covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) are novel porous materials that exhibit the advantages of covalent and metal‐organic frameworks. However, it is extremely difficult to resolve their atomic structure and better understand their structure‐properties relation. This work utilizes a synergistic combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods to unravel the atomic mapping of a photoactive ruthenium‐MCOF.








Abstract
Covalent and metal‐organic frameworks (COFs and MOFs) have shown great promise in light‐driven processes mainly due to their ligand‐to‐metal charge‐separation properties, as well as having access to a diverse range of photoactive metalloligands and organic linkers. However, both frameworks present individual drawbacks that can potentially be avoided by combining both systems (metal and covalent) to produce metal‐covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), exhibiting the advantages of both material types. Yet, due to their poor crystallinity, the understanding of the structure‐properties relation of MCOFs remains unclear. Herein, we report photoactive linkers in the form of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (tpy: 2,2′,6,2″‐terpyridine) complex which covalently binds to a luminescent pyrene core to yield a new, photoactive Schiff‐base MCOF. The structure, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of this novel material have been exhaustively characterized by a wide range of microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods. This combined experimental and computational work represents a significant step toward the fundamental understanding of the photoactive units within the framework, their hierarchical arrangement and interactions with substrates, which is essential for the future design of efficient photocatalytic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The first case of orthogonal integration of holographic and phosphorescent images is demonstrated, providing a novel paradigm for high‐security level information encryption and advanced anticounterfeiting.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) polymer materials have sparked considerable research interests in recent years, but their optical function is still limited for multi‐mode optical imaging. Herein, a feasible and universal approach is proposed to endow ORTP polymer materials with periodic refractive index modulation functions by holographic patterning. The key to this approach is to design a two‐stage stepwise crosslinking. Stage‐1, with low crosslinking density (≤0.75 mol L−1), is phosphorescence‐silent but can provide greater free volume for monomer diffusion and thus facilitate the patterning of refractive index modulated holograms via photopolymerization‐induced phase separation. The dense crosslinking at stage‐2 can turn on phosphorescence with the intensity rising by 144% when the crosslinking density increases from 3.77 to 4.12 mol L−1. The enhanced phosphorescence is primarily ascribed to the increase of conformational distortion and spin‐orbit coupling of organic phosphors based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, the first example is demonstrated of holographic plastic with the unique capability of independently displaying holographic andphosphorescent images. This work not only provides a novel paradigm to impart added optical functions to ORTP polymer materials but also paves the way for the development of high‐security optical materials to combat counterfeiting.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high‐strength gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength exceeding 10 MPa is developed, combined with rapid photocross‐linking capability. This hydrogel enables the fabrication of complex and precise scaffolds through 3D printing. When loaded with roxadustat, the scaffold facilitates sustained‐release therapy, effectively remodeling inflammatory microenvironments. This approach presents a promising solution for the repair of osteoporotic bone defects.









Abstract
Osteoporosis is a widespread condition that induces an inflammatory microenvironment, limiting the effectiveness of conventional therapies and presenting significant challenges for bone defect repair. To address these issues, a high‐strength gelatin hydrogel scaffold loaded with roxadustat is developed, specifically designed to remodel the inflammatory microenvironment and enhance osteoporotic bone regeneration. By incorporating minimal methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) into an o‐nitrobenzyl functionalized gelatin (GelNB) matrix, a gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength of 10 MPa is achieved, providing exceptional structural stability and enabling precise scaffold fabrication through digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Validated through cell experiments and animal studies, the hydrogel scaffold supports cell adhesion and migration, offers excellent tissue compatibility, and is fully degradable, meeting the requirements of a therapeutic scaffold. Including roxadustat further enhances the scaffold's functionality by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment via hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) signaling, significantly improving bone defect repair in osteoporotic models. This drug‐loaded scaffold effectively addresses inflammation‐induced limitations and enhances the regenerative capacity of the affected area, paving the way for improved therapeutic outcomes in osteoporotic bone repair.

This study presents an innovative solid additive approach to enhance J‐aggregation and exciton delocalization in NIR‐OPDs, improving their sensitivity and specific detectivity across 695–860 nm, advancing self‐powered organic photodetection applications.








Abstract
Near‐infrared organic photodetectors (NIR‐OPDs) have emerged as increasingly significant in optoelectronics, offering unparalleled advantages for applications in health monitoring and night vision. The development of self‐powered devices with low dark currents and enhanced NIR sensitivity involves complex engineering that requires careful material selection, defect state density control, and environmental consideration. In this study, an innovative approach is introduced that utilizes solid additive (DIB) to induce improvements in the J‐aggregation morphology and exciton delocalization in acceptor molecules. The goal is to broaden the response spectrum of the device and augment its detection capabilities. The key findings revealed that solid additive exhibit an electrostatic affinity for acceptors, which facilitates their orderly face‐to‐face stacking and controls the π–π stacking distance. These enhanced intermolecular interactions lead to the delocalization of electron–hole pairs, reduced exciton recombination, and increased charge separation efficiency. Consequently, the modified devices exhibited exceptional specific detectivity, exceeding 1014 Jones across the wavelength range of 695–860 nm, thereby establishing a new standard for NIR response in organic photodetection. Overall, this study successfully addressed the compatibility challenges associated with self‐powered NIR‐OPDs, thereby expanding their potential applications in various settings.

Abstract
The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics and offered the prospect for new devices based on valleys. However, the implementation of valley‐based devices remains challenging in practice. Here, by taking advantage of the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the realizations of valley devices, or filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. All the devices are configured as the structures of input and output ports bridged by channels. The phononic crystals serving as ports allow the propagation of both valley polarizations, whereas the phononic crystals serving as channels, as they are narrow, only allow the propagation of single polarizations. For valley filters that achieve valley‐polarized currents, the bridge channel is simply a straight single phononic crystal, but for valley valves that can turn off the valley‐polarized currents, the channel consists of two parts, allowing the propagation of opposite valley polarizations. The valley diverters have one input port, and two output ports, and thus a branched channel, and the three parts in the channel allow the propagation of the same valley polarizations, so that the energy flow can be partitioned. The results may serve as a basis for developing advanced acoustic valley devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Au substrate induces a strain in the adhered bottommost MoS2 layer. The strain weakens the coupling at the first MoS2‐MoS2 interface, making it the weakest point in the system, therefore MoS2 crystal preferentially cleaves at this interface, facilitating the selective exfoliation of large‐area monolayers with size comparable to that of the parent crystal.








Abstract
Gold‐assisted exfoliation (GAE) is a groundbreaking mechanical exfoliation technique that produces centimeter‐scale single‐crystal monolayers of 2D materials. Such large, high‐quality films offer unparalleled advantages over the micron‐sized flakes typically produced by conventional exfoliation techniques, significantly accelerating the research and technological advancements in the field of 2D materials. Despite its wide applications, the fundamental mechanism of GAE remains poorly understood. In this study, using MoS₂ on Au as a model system, ultra‐low frequency Raman spectroscopy is employed to elucidate how the interlayer interactions within MoS2 crystals are impacted by the gold substrate. The results reveal that the coupling at the first MoS2‐MoS2 interface between the adhered layer on the gold substrate and the adjacent layer is substantially weakened, with the binding force being reduced to nearly zero. This renders the first interface the weakest point in the system, thereby the crystal preferentially cleaves at this junction, generating large‐area monolayers with sizes comparable to the parent crystal. Biaxial strain in the adhered layer, induced by the gold substrate, is identified as the driving factor for the decoupling effect. The strain‐induced decoupling effect is established as the primary mechanism of GAE, which can also play a significant role in general mechanical exfoliations.

<title>Polyamine‐Depleting Hydrogen‐Bond Organic Frameworks Unleash Dendritic Cell and T Cell Vigor for Targeted CRISPR/Cas‐Assisted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A microfluidic‐assisted hydrogen‐bond organic framework (HOF) nanoplatforms depletes polyamines in the tumor microenvironment, reversing T‐cell immunosuppression and enhancing dendritic cell activity. By releasing CRISPR‐Cas9 and inducing neoantigen generation via carbonyl stress and mutational burden elevation, this system enables precision cancer immunotherapy through dual‐action mechanisms targeting both immune vigor and tumor vulnerability.








Abstract
Polyamines have tantalized cancer researchers as a potential means to rein in the rampant growth of cancer cells. However, clinical trials in recent decades have disappointed in delivering notable progress. Herein, a microfluidic‐assisted synthetic hydrogen‐bond organic framework (HOF) as a polyamine‐depleting nanoplatforms designed to unleash the vigor of both dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells for precision cancer immunotherapy is reported. Upon internalization by tumor cells, the loaded plasma amine oxidase (PAO) in HOF efficiently depletes polyamines, remolding the tumor microenvironment and alleviating T‐cell immunosuppression. This process also generates acrolein and H2O2, triggering CRISPR‐assisted neoantigen generation. Specifically, Acrolein induces carbonyl stress, increasing mutational burdens. Simultaneously, HOF leverages the energy from the bis[2,4,5‐trichloro‐6‐(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO)‐H2O2 reaction for CRET‐triggered singlet oxygen production, leading to thioether bond cleavage and release CRISPR‐Cas9. Once released, CRISPR‐Cas9 knocks out the DNA mismatch repair (MMR)‐related MLH1 gene, further elevating mutational burdens and generating neoantigens, ideal targets for DCs. This dual‐action strategy not only corrects T‐cell immunosuppression but also enhances DC efficacy, presenting a powerful approach for tumor immunotherapy.

<title>“Water‐In‐Oil” Electrolyte Enabled by Microphase Separation Regulation for Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A microphase separated “water‐in‐oil” (W/O) electrolyte is proposed to simultaneously regulate the water molecules in both electrolyte bulk and electrode interface. Benefiting from the directed movement and reversible demulsification of micelles under the electric field, the as‐developed zinc metal batteries using W/O electrolyte exhibits extended cyclability, improve interface dynamics and negligible H2 evolution.








Abstract
The sustained hydrogen evolution and zinc (Zn) dendrite growth greatly impede the practical application of low‐cost aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, a microphase separation strategy is proposed to construct a ″water‐in‐oil (W/O) electrolyte to endow durable ZMBs. As validated by theoretical modeling and experimental characterizations, the unique reverse micelle structure within the electrolyte not only disrupts water hydrogen bonding and efficiently inhibits the water consumption at Zn anode, but also undergoes directed movement and reversible demulsification under electric field, thus enhancing the anode desolvation kinetics and inhibiting the interfacial side reactions. Owing to the simultaneous regulation of water molecules in both electrolyte bulk and anode interface, this W/O electrolyte achieves a high Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.76% over 6000 cycles, and maintains an extend lifespan in Zn||V10O24·12H2O (VOH) cells with negligible hydrogen evolution and dendrite formation. These key findings are expected to promote the electrolyte engineering toward reversible ZMBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, an effective strategy is proposed to efficiently harvest waste heat by Zn‐ion battery under thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles. A record high temperature coefficient of 2.944 mV K−1 is obtained, leading to the high relative Carnot efficiency of 26.08% and energy efficiency of 104.11% when the battery is charged at 50 °C and discharged at 5 °C.








Abstract
Typical technologies that can convert waste heat into electricity include thermoelectrics, thermionic capacitors, thermo‐cells, thermal charge cells, and thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles. They have small thermal‐to‐electrical conversion efficiency or poor stability, severely hindering the efficient recovery of waste heat. Herein, a thermally regenerative electrochemical Zn‐ion battery to work under Carnot‐like mode to efficiently harvest waste heat into electricity is successfully developed. Through introducing Layered Double Hydroxides to modify the battery's anode reaction, a record absolute high temperature coefficient of 2.944 mV K−1 is achieved in NiHCF/Zn battery, leading to a high thermal‐to‐electrical conversion efficiency of 26.08% of the Carnot efficiency and an extraordinary energy efficiency of 104.11% when the battery is charged at 50 °C and discharged at 5 °C. This work demonstrates that thermally regenerative electrochemical batteries can effectively harvest waste heat to provide a powerful energy conversion technology.

<title>Antibody‐level Bacteria Grabbing by “Mechanic Invasion” of Bioinspired Hedgehog Artificial Mesoporous Nanostructure for Hierarchical Dynamic Identification and Light‐Response Sterilization</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202416906?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through the de novo design of bioinspired hedgehog artificial mesoporous nanostructure with virus‐like spiky topography (mAPt), the antibody‐level bacteria grabbing attributed to the “mechanic invasion”‐induced hierarchical dynamic identification ranging from rough surface contact to penetration fixation is verified. Further integrated with spiky‐induced near‐superblack characteristic and plasmonic “hot spot”, mAPt enables advanced applications in immunoassay and photothermal sterilization.








Abstract
The interactions exploration between microorganisms and nanostructures are pivotal steps toward advanced applications, but the antibody‐level bacteria grabbing is limited by the poor understanding of interface identification mechanisms in small‐sized systems. Herein, the de novo design of a bioinspired hedgehog artificial mesoporous nanostructure (core–shell mesoporous Au@Pt (mAPt)) are proposed to investigate the association between the topography design and efficient bacteria grabbing. These observations indicate that virus‐like spiky topography compensates for the obstacles faced by small‐sized materials for bacteria grabbing, including the lack of requisite microscopic cavities and sufficient contact area. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals that spiky topography with heightened mechano‐invasiveness (6.56 × 103 KJ mol−1) facilitates antibody‐level bacteria grabbing, attributed to the “mechanic invasion”‐induced hierarchical dynamic identification ranging from rough surface contact to penetration fixation. Furthermore, light reflectance and finite element calculation confirmed that mAPt exhibits near‐superblack characteristic and plasmonic hot spot, facilitating enhanced photothermal conversion with power dissipation density at 2.04 × 1021 W m−3. After integrating the hierarchical dynamic identification with enhanced light response, mAPt enables advanced applications in immunoassay with 50‐fold sensitivity enhancement and over 99.99% in vitro photothermal sterilization. It is anticipated that this novel biomimetic design provides a deeper understanding of bacteria grabbing and a promising paradigm for bacteria combating.

Abstract
Lab‐on‐a‐chip systems seek to leverage microfluidic chips to enable small‐scale fluid manipulation, holding significant potential to revolutionize science and industry. However, existing microfluidic chips have been largely designed with static fluid structures for specific single‐purpose applications, which lack adaptability and flexibility for diverse applications. Inspired by the general‐purpose design strategy of the customizable chip of integrated circuit – field programmable gate array whose hardware can be reconfigured via software programming for multifunctionality after manufacturing, a conceptual‐new reconfigurable microfluidic chip — field programmable topographic morphing array (FPTMA) is devised with exceptional structural reconfiguration, field programmability, and function scalability for general‐purpose lab‐on‐a‐chip systems that beyond the reach of current state‐of‐art lab‐on‐chip systems. FPTMA can be software programmed to dynamically shape an elastic meta‐interface from the initial smooth structure into desired time‐varying topographic structures and thus generate spatiotemporal topographic‐morphing‐induced capillary forces to actively manipulate multidroplets in parallel and enable real‐time reconfiguring diverse microfluidic operations/functions/flow networks as well as workflows. It is envisioned that the development of the FPTMA‐driven lab‐on‐a‐chip systems that leverage dynamic interfacial topographies to digitally handle microfluidics would significantly stimulate numerous technological innovations in biology/medicine/chemistry.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Combining the pixelated design with multi‐materials of different photocarrier responses and triggering switches, the photon‐induced multitemporal ultrafast programming is achieved in a Terahertz metadevice with the broadband and multiple polarization states. With this, time‐ and frequency‐switchable logic devices are demonstrated at a picosecond scale, which facilitates miniaturized light‐driven devices and integrated wave elements for optical computing, high‐quality communication, quantum, nonlinear optics, and others.








Abstract
Dynamic terahertz (THz) metasurface can feature modulated and multiplexed electromagnetic functionalities, important for wave‐based computation, six‐generation communications, and other applications. The versatile dynamic switching typically relies on a series of complex or incompatible multifield activations, with excessive system complexity, additional loss, slow modulation speed, and inertial time‐varying properties, limiting more widespread applications. Here, a photon‐induced ultrafast programmable THz metadevice is reoprted in time‐frequency dimensions with polarization‐decoupled temporal responses. By the pixelated design with multi‐materials and triggering switches, the multimodal modulation transcends the constraints inherent in materials, enabling the ultrafast programmable temporal evolution. All the resonances can be independently programmed at the working band from 0.6 to 2 THz. The tri‐temporal (with switching time of 1.25, 1, and 4.75 ps) and bi‐temporal (with switching time of 2.25 and 4.75 ps) dynamic manipulations are performed by all‐optical driven molecularization process of hybrid metasurfaces loaded with silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) under different polarizations. Combining these features, the temporally programmed THz logic gates are last experimentally demonstrated, possessing basic operation of XNOR, NOR, and OR, as a proof‐of‐concept application. This reported light‐driven programmable THz flat‐optics allows ultrafast hybrid molecularization processes and new possibilities for miniaturized, flexible, multifunctional, and temporally programmable integrated devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The TCPL based on a multidimensional performance expansion strategy has performance indexes that are much higher than those of existing multicellular materials. By incorporating a deformation constraint strategy into TCPL, ETCPL has high‐stress uniformity and extraordinary plastic properties with strain energy improved by 51.56%. Besides, the strength‐density performances of both metamaterials significantly exceed predictions of Gibson–Ashby model up to 75.2% maximum.








Abstract
The study of classical mechanical metamaterials has overwhelmingly remained at the elastic stage, while the increase in extreme speeds of vehicles and aircraft has created an urgent need and demanding requirements for excellent plasticity performance. Although some plastically deformable metamaterials exist, high initial peak stresses, short plastic strokes, and low plastic stresses limit their applications considerably. Here, an ideal malleable large‐deformation metamaterial featuring high‐stress levels and stability is reported. A performance‐oriented multidimensional performance expansion strategy is adopted to obtain the bionic triangular corrugation‐based plate lattice (TCPL) metamaterial. Then, the deformation constraint strategy that TCPL is innovatively used as the main topology with lateral expansion and buckling inhibited by the inserted enhancing topology is proposed, thus obtaining the built‐in dual‐topology enhanced TCPL (ETCPL). The ETCPL is again substantially strengthened in stress uniformity with almost no gradient and mechanical properties with strain energy improved by 51.56%. They are much more robust than typical multicellular materials, with the largest performance enhancement reaching 18 667.19%. In addition, the strength‐density performances of both metamaterials significantly exceed the predictions of Gibson–Ashby model up to 75.2% maximum. The unprecedented performance confirms that multidimensional performance expansion strategy and deformation constraint strategy have created new design guidelines for ideal high‐performance plastic metamaterials.

<title>Ultra‐Fast, Unidirectional Water Absorption on Wood Ear</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The ultra‐fast, unidirectional water absorption is observed on the abaxial surface of wood ear, featuring dense micro‐sized hairs atop a porous sublayer containing micro‐/nano‐pores. The synergistic lateral and vertical wicking reduces droplet absorption time by two orders of magnitude compared to the un‐hairy porous surface (35 ms vs 5.2 s). This unique absorption mechanism holds significant potential for liquid manipulation in porous media.








Abstract
Materials exhibiting rapid, unidirectional liquid absorption are desirable for comfort textiles and wound dressings. Implementing chemical or structural gradient along the vertical axis of substrates is an effective way to achieve such properties. Liquid's lateral spreading across the substrate affects area occurring vertical imbibition. However, the influence of lateral spreading on liquid's overall absorption remains unexplored. Findings on ultra‐fast, unidirectional water absorption on the abhymenium of wood ear fungi are presented, featuring dense micro‐sized hairs atop a porous sublayer containing smaller micro‐/nano‐pores. These hairs facilitate lateral spreading, and the gradient‐sized structures from the surface hairs to the internal pores enhance capillary force, promoting efficient vertical imbibition. The synergistic wicking mechanism in both directions shortens absorption time of a 1‐µL droplet by two orders of magnitude compared to a solely porous surface (35 ms vs 5.2 s). An artificial micro‐pillar array on a porous substrate also exhibits ultra‐fast, unidirectional water absorption. This study advances the understanding of liquid dynamics in porous media and provides a blueprint for engineering materials with superior liquid management.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Employing near‐infrared II (NIR‐II) imaging with indocyanine green (ICG)‐conjugated recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) protein allows for precise visualization of early follicles. This technique aids in the tracking of follicular development, ovarian vasculature, and ovarian tumors, exceeding the spatial capabilities of ultrasound and MRI. The approach provides new perspectives into infertility conditions and tumor monitoring.








Abstract
Follicular tracking is typically conducted using ultrasound technology, but its effectiveness is constrained by limited resolution. High‐resolution imaging of deep tissues can be accomplished using luminescence imaging in the near‐infrared II window (NIR‐II, 1000–1700 nm); however, the contrast agents that are used lack specificity. Here, it is reported that the FDA‐approved indocyanine green (ICG)‐conjugated recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) protein can target early follicles with long‐term effectiveness. A novel high‐resolution NIR‐II imaging approach is developed for monitoring follicular development as well as ovulation using multi‐color imaging of ovarian vessels with a combination of non‐overlapping downconversion nanoparticles (DCNPs). The results showed that the ability to monitor early follicles of around 50 µm in diameter exceeded the spatial and temporal resolution of ultrasound or MRI without the reproductive damage associated with computed tomography radiation, and this enabled the clinical identification of the follicular reserve in patients with infertility diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In addition, NIR‐II imaging clearly targeted ovarian tumors and showed micro‐metastatic lesions, thus providing a new tool for monitoring tumors in vivo and guiding surgical resection.

<title>Efficient Blade‐Coated Wide‐Bandgap and Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells via a Three‐Step Restraining Strategy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Strict control of crystal growth has historically limited the efficiency of blade‐coated perovskite solar cells compared to spin‐coated devices. Here, a three‐step restraining strategy that employs a functional additive to regulate crystal growth enables efficient blade‐coated perovskite solar cells. This approach achieves a 19.97% efficiency for single‐junction 1.77 eV wide‐bandgap cells and a 27.11% efficiency for 2‐terminal all‐perovskite tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Blade‐coating techniques have attracted significant attention for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their high precursor utilization and simplicity. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of blade‐coated PSCs often lags behind that of spin‐coated devices, mainly due to difficulties in precisely controlling perovskite film formation during pre‐nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation, and crystallization in the blade‐coating and N2‐knife drying processes. In this work, a three‐step restraining strategy is introduced utilizing functional glycine amide hydrochloride to regulate pre‐nucleation clustering, suppress excessive heterogeneous nucleation, and decelerate crystallization, enabling comprehensive control of the perovskite film formation processes. This approach results in enlarged grains, reduced defect densities, and highly oriented crystalline wide‐bandgap perovskite films with significantly prolonged carrier lifetimes, achieving a maximum PCE of 19.97% for 1.77 eV‐bandgap blade‐coated PSCs. Furthermore, two‐terminal tandem cells, composed of wide‐bandgap perovskite top cells and 1.25 eV‐bandgap perovskite bottom cells fabricated via blade coating, yield an impressive PCE of 27.11% (stabilized at 26.87%). This study offers comprehensive insights into controlling pre‐nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation, and crystallization during blade coating, providing valuable guidance for developing high‐performance, large‐area devices in the future.

This review systematically addresses the impact of nanomedicines’ mechanical properties on their biomedical performance, offering valuable insights for future developments in the field.








Abstract
Nanomaterials have become essential in the daily lives, finding applications in food, skincare, drugs, and vaccines. Traditionally, the surface chemistry of nanoparticles (NPs) is considered the key factor in determining their interactions with biological systems. However, recent studies have shown that the mechanical properties of nanomaterials are equally important in regulating nano‐bio interactions, though they have often been overlooked. Tuning the mechanical properties of nanomaterials and designing them for biomedical applications is thus crucial. This review begins by discussing the various mechanical cues in biological processes, including how viruses and cells adjust their mechanical properties throughout their life cycles. Basic concepts and terminology related to NP mechanical properties are introduced. Next, five different groups of nanomaterials with tunable mechanical properties are explored. The review then examines the impact of NP mechanical properties on their interactions in vitro and in vivo, covering tumor‐targeted drug delivery, nanovaccines, and emerging applications such as oral and intranasal drug delivery. Current challenges in the field and perspectives on future developments are also provided.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review discusses defect engineering strategies for metal‐based atomically thin materials (M‐ATMs) to enhance their catalytic performance in electrochemical reactions, addressing challenges like insufficient active sites and slow kinetics, while exploring their potential in promoting a circular economy.








Abstract
Recently, metal‐based atomically thin materials (M‐ATMs) have experienced rapid development due to their large specific surface areas, abundant electrochemically accessible sites, attractive surface chemistry, and strong in‐plane chemical bonds. These characteristics make them highly desirable for energy‐related conversion reactions. However, the insufficient active sites and slow reaction kinetics leading to unsatisfactory electrocatalytic performance limited their commercial application. To address these issues, defect engineering of M‐ATMs has emerged to increase the active sites, modify the electronic structure, and enhance the catalytic reactivity and stability. This review provides a comprehensive summary of defect engineering strategies for M‐ATM nanostructures, including vacancy creation, heteroatom doping, amorphous phase/grain boundary generation, and heterointerface construction. Introducing recent advancements in the application of M‐ATMs in electrochemical small molecule conversion reactions (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur), which can contribute to a circular economy by recycling molecules like H2, O2, CO2, N2, and S. Furthermore, a crucial link between the reconstruction of atomic‐level structure and catalytic activity via analyzing the dynamic evolution of M‐ATMs during the reaction process is established. The review also outlines the challenges and prospects associated with M‐ATM‐based catalysts to inspire further research efforts in developing high‐performance M‐ATMs.

<title>Experimental and Theoretical Force Constants as Meaningful Indicator for Interatomic Bonding Characteristics and the Specific Case of Elemental Antimony</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study investigates experimental and theoretical force constants of antimony. Comparison with other materials indicates a continuous transition from multicenter bonding to covalent bonding characteristics. This makes the force constants a clear indicator for the degree of multicenter bonding in electron‐rich materials and a fingerprint in material screening for future phase change material or thermoelectric applications. 








Abstract
Stable Sb exhibits a rhombohedral structure, often referred to as distorted primitive cubic, with each Sb atom having three short and three longer first neighbor bonds. However, this crystal structure can also be interpreted as being layered, putting emphasis on only three short first neighbor bonds. Therefore, temperature‐dependent extended X‐ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is carried out at the Sb K‐edge in order to obtain more detailed information on local structural and vibrational properties. Evaluation of the temperature‐dependent bond lengths provides the temperature‐dependent Peierls distortion while the temperature dependence of the variance of the interatomic distance distribution yields the EXAFS force constants. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used for determining projected force constants. Both EXAFS and DFT force constants are compared to those of other materials with different bonding characteristics, including two‐center covalently bonded semiconductors, multicenter bonded IV–VI and V2VI3 compounds, and metallic Cu. Clearly, Sb exhibits characteristics of both localized covalent bonding and delocalized multicenter bonding. This suggests a continuous transition between these two bonding scenarios and adds to the understanding of bonding in elemental Sb in particular and in IV–VI and V2VI3 materials in general.

Rare earth phosphates with hexagonal crystal structure have been demonstrated to exhibit impressive 2e− ORR performance over a wide potential and pH range, which can be attributed to their enriched open channels, large specific surface feature, optimal metal spatial distance, unwavering compositional stability as well as favorable electronic structure.








Abstract
The electrochemical two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) offers a sustainable pathway for the production of H2O2; however, the development of electrocatalysts with exceptional activity, selectivity, and long‐term stability remains a challenging task. Herein, a novel approach is presented to addressing this challenge by synthesizing hierarchical hollow SmPO4 nanospheres with open channels via a two‐step hydrothermal treatment. The produced compound demonstrates remarkable 2e− selectivity, exceeding 93% across a wide potential range of 0.0–0.6 V in 0.1 m KOH, with a peak of 96% at 0.45 V. When employed as the cathode in a flow cell, the synthesized SmPO4 exhibits impressive stability at 100 mA cm−2 for 12 h, consistently achieving a Faradaic efficiency above 90%. Using X‐ray absorption, in situ Raman and Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopies, theoretical calculations, and post‐ORR assessments, it is found that this hollow compound possesses intrinsic open channels and is characterized by the optimal metal atomic spacing, and exceptional structural and compositional stabilities. These factors significantly enhance the thermodynamics, kinetics, and stability of the 2e− ORR process. Notably, the produced compound also exhibits outstanding 2e− ORR performance in neutral environments. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to other hollow rare‐earth–P–O compounds, demonstrating excellent 2e− ORR performance under both neutral and alkaline conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Introducing capacitive Mn into IrO2 modulates the local electronic structure and adsorption behavior. Under applied bias, dynamic redox reactions induce localized charge accumulation, leading to significant pseudocapacitance and improved OER kinetics at the Ir sites. Furthermore, the higher energy for oxygen vacancy formation inhibits lattice oxygen activation, thereby improving stability.








Abstract
The sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis necessitates applied bias to facilitate electron transfer as well as bond cleavage and formation. Traditional electrocatalysis focuses on analyzing the effects of electron transfer, while the role of charge accumulation induced by the applied overpotential has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence mechanism of bias‐driven charge accumulation, capacitive Mn is incorporated into IrO2 to regulate the local electronic structure and the adsorption behavior. The applied bias triggers dynamic redox reactions at the active sites, which introduce local charge accumulation on the surface of electrocatalyst. Under bias, Mn oxidation induced a noticeable pseudocapacitance in the pre‐OER region, promoting the OER kinetics of iridium sites. Meanwhile, the increased oxygen vacancy formation energy further prevents the lattice oxygen activation. The PEM electrolyzer, equipped with optimal materials as an anode, operates at a low driving voltage of 1.637 V under 2.0 A cm−2, maintaining stable performance for over 800 h with a low degradation rate (19.4 µV h−1). This work provides insights into the performance of metal oxide catalysts in acidic environments and offers forward‐looking strategies for enhancing the catalytic performance through dynamic redox induced capacitive behavior.

The declined regeneration potential of aging NPPCs fails to antagonize IVDD. The in‐house‐customized lipid nanoparticles efficiently introduce Klotho circRNA into NPPCs to engender a renascent phenotypic and attune the balance of ECM synthesis/catabolism. Moreover, chemokine‐scavenging hydrogel reservoir in tandem with NPPCs rejuvenated NT‐LNPs enlists the regenerative capacity of resident NPPCs and restoration of youthful structure and functional features to the IVD.








Abstract
The decreased regeneration potential of aging nucleus pulposus resident progenitor cells (NPPCs) fails to resist intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), and strategies to remodel the regeneration capacity of senescent NPPC are urgently needed. A decrease in Klotho gene expression in NPPCs of both old mice and humans exacerbates the impaired regenerative functionality of NPPC. Here, an NPPC‐targeted lipid thymine nanoparticle (NT‐LNP) is reported for the in situ manipulation of the regenerative repair potential of NPPCs, restoration of degenerated nucleus pulposus tissue, and mitigation of IVDD. Specifically, the results showed that the in‐house customized lipid nanoparticles efficiently introduced Klotho circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) into NPPCs to engender a renascent phenotype and tuned the balance of extracellular matrix synthesis/catabolism in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, an intradiscal injectable hydrogel system that scavenges chemokines (MCP1 and IL8) in tandem with NPPCs rejuvenated NT‐LNPs in the IVD, modulating the inflammatory environment and synergistically promoting the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. In summary, the findings establish that NPPCs can be re‐engineered to be youthful and pluripotent to maintain homeostasis and rejuvenation, thereby providing a reversible treatment strategy for IVDD with broad application in other senescence‐related diseases.

Kinetic control of photopolymerization tunes pore size during the formation of macroporous hydrogel scaffolds via liquid–liquid phase separation. The fabrication process is cytocompatible for direct 3D cell culture within tunable macroporous biomaterials.








Abstract
3D scaffolds enable biological investigations with a more natural cell conformation. However, the porosity of synthetic hydrogels is often limited to the nanometer scale, which confines the movement of 3D encapsulated cells and restricts dynamic cell processes. Precise control of hydrogel porosity across length scales remains a challenge and the development of porous materials that allow cell infiltration, spreading, and migration in a manner more similar to natural ECM environments is desirable. Here, a straightforward and reliable method is presented for generating kinetically‐controlled macroporous biomaterials using liquid–liquid phase separation between poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dextran. Photopolymerization‐induced phase separation resulted in macroporous hydrogels with tunable pore size. Varying light intensity and hydrogel composition controlled polymerization kinetics, time to percolation, and complete gelation, which defined the average pore diameter (Ø = 1–200 µm) and final gel stiffness of the formed hydrogels. Critically, for biological applications, macroporous hydrogels are prepared from aqueous polymer solutions at physiological pH and temperature using visible light, allowing for direct cell encapsulation. Human dermal fibroblasts in a range of macroporous gels are encapsulated with different pore sizes. Porosity improved cell spreading with respect to bulk gels and allowed migration in the porous biomaterials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A highly transparent photochromic hydrogel electrolyte is developed, which not only serves as an electrolyte for zinc anode‐based electrochromic devices but also provides a photochromic effect to reduce tinted transmittance. These dual‐responsive dimmers address concerns about low transmittance contrast in electrochromic devices, representing a significant step forward for high‐contrast dimming in dynamic windows and AR glasses.








Abstract
Electrochromism stands out as a highly promising technology for applications including variable optical attenuators, optical switches, transparent displays, and dynamic windows. The pursuit of high‐contrast tunability in electrochromic devices remains a challenging goal. Here, the first photochromic hydrogel electrolyte is reported for electro‐ and photo‐dual responsive chromatic devices that yield a high transmittance contrast at 633 nm (ΔT = 83.1%), along with a tinted transmittance below 1.5%. Such high‐contrast devices not only hold great promise for dynamic windows but also enable seamless transitions between transparent augmented reality (AR) glass and opaque virtual reality (VR) glass. These findings introduce an innovative strategy for the design of high‐contrast dimmers, opening new avenues for the development of chromatic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The combination of emulsions, slip casting, and inorganic particle loaded suspensions forms a processing platform that allows the controlled fabrication of intricate inorganic/inorganic composites. This new platform can be used for example to produce strong and lightweight porous samples with pores coated by a conformal layer of a second material or tough fiber‐reinforced composites.








Abstract
Inorganic/inorganic composites are found in multiple applications crucial for the energy transition, from nuclear reactors to energy storage devices. Their microstructures dictate their properties from mass transport to fracture resistance. Consequently, there has been a multitude of processes developed to control them, from powder mixing and the use of short or long fibers, to tape casting for laminates up to recent 3D printing. Here, emulsions and slip casting are combined into a simpler, broadly available, inexpensive processing platform that allows for in situ control of composite microstructure while also enabling complex 3D shaping. This study shows that slip casting of emulsions triggers a two‐step solvent removal, opening the possibility for the conformal coating of pores. This process is showcased by producing strong and lightweight alumina scaffolds reinforced by a conformal zirconia coating. In addition, by manipulating magnetically responsive droplets, their distribution can be controlled, allowing for the formation of inorganic fibers inside an inorganic matrix in situ during slip casting. Using this approach, alumina has been reinforced with aligned metallic iron fibers to prepare composites with a work of fracture an order of magnitude higher than the pure ceramics.

An anti‐freezing acid‐salt hybrid electrolyte with the stable anion−cation−H2O (Cl−−Zn2+−H2O) solvation structure is developed, which achieves unconventional proton transport through strong interactions between hydrophilic ions and H2O and improves cycling stability by avoiding severe structure destruction of α‐MoO3 anodes, resulting in providing a steady power supply for the VHCF//α‐MoO3 proton storage device at −80 °C.









Abstract
The critical challenges in developing ultralow‐temperature proton‐based energy storage systems are enhancing the diffusion kinetics of charge carriers and inhibiting water‐triggered interfacial side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes. Here an acid‐salt hybrid electrolyte with a stable anion−cation−H2O solvation structure that realizes unconventional proton transport at ultralow temperature is shown, which is crucial for electrodes and devices to achieve high rate‐capacity and stable interface compatibility with electrodes. Through multiscale simulations and experimental investigations in the electrolyte employing ZnCl2 introduced into 0.2 M H2SO4 solution, it is discovered that unique anion−cation−H2O solvation structure endows the electrolyte with low‐temperature‐adaptive feature and favorable water network channels for rapid proton transport. In situ XRD and multiple spectroscopic techniques further reveal that the stable 3D network structure inhibits free water‐triggered deleterious electrode structure distortion by immobilizing free water molecules to achieve outstanding cycling stability. Hence, VHCF//α‐MoO3 hybrid proton capacitors deliver an unexpected capacity of 39.8 mAh g−1 at a high current density of 1 A g−1 (−80 °C) and steady power supply under ultralow temperatures (96% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at −80 °C). The anti‐freezing hybrid electrolyte design provides an effective strategy to improve the application of energy storage devices in ultralow temperatures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The advent of heterogenous photothermal catalysis technology for the selective upcycling of mixed plastics represents a revolutionary breakthrough amidst the resolving global crisis of plastic pollution. This transformative technology not only addresses the inefficiencies and exorbitant costs associated with conventional plastic recycling methods but also heralds a profound impact on the realms of energy and environmental science.








Abstract
The selective recycling of mixed plastic wastes with similar structural units is challenging. While heterogeneous catalysis shows potential for selective recycling, challenges such as complex mass transfer at multiphase interfaces and unclear catalytic mechanisms have slowed progress. In this study, a breakthrough in recycling mixed polyester wastes is introduced using heterogeneous photothermal catalysis. By adding co‐solvents, the difficulties associated with multiphase interfacial mass transfer are overcome. Grain boundary (GB)‐rich CeO2 photothermal catalysts are used to selectively glycolyze mixed poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) (PC) plastics into bisphenol A (BPA) and bis(2‐hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), achieving yields of 97.8% and 93.4%, respectively. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies in GB‐rich CeO2 catalysts adjusts the adsorption energy of intermediates, leading to more selective and efficient depolymerization compared to GB‐poor CeO2 catalysts. The economic and environmental analysis demonstrates that this process, which utilizes heterogeneous photothermal catalysis, provides significant energy savings and carbon reduction, representing a major advancement in mixed plastic waste recycling.

<title>Permanent Electride Magnets Induced by Quasi‐Atomic Non‐Nucleus‐Bound Electrons</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interstitial quasi‐atomic electrons (IQE) located in cationic cavities have driven diverse magnetic phases by inherited magnetic properties. This reports, the IQEs first carry the permanent magnet via spin‐orbit coupling (SOC) with rare‐earth cations in the ferrite‐like magnetic structure 2D electride [Re2C]2+2e−. This finding suggests a platform for exploring the relationship between SOC and coercivity using the smallest magnetic particles.








Abstract
Interstitial quasi‐atomic electrons (IQEs) in the quantized energy levels of positively charged cavities possess a substantial own magnetic moment and control the magnetism of crystalline electrides depending on the interaction with surrounding cations. However, weak spin‐orbit coupling and gentle exchange interaction restricted by the IQEs preclude a large magnetic anisotropic, remaining a challenge for a hard magnetism. It is reported that 2D [Re2C]2+·2e− electrides (Re = Er, Ho, Dy, and Tb) show the permanent magnetism in a ferrimagnetic ground state, mimicking the ferrites composed of magnetic sublattices with different spin polarizations. Magnetic interaction between Re‐spin lattice and IQE‐spin lattice in the [Re2C]2+·2e− electrides results in a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and high coercivity, giving a maximum energy product of 15 MGOe. It is demonstrated that the spontaneous breaking of magnetic IQE‐sublattice through substitution with paramagnetic elements produces a crossover into an antiferromagnetic spin ordering of Re‐sublattice, implying that the magnetic sublattice of IQEs drives the permanent magnetism.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Correlation clustering imaging (CLIM) exploits local intensity fluctuations observed by fluorescence microscopy in metal‐halide perovskite films and their solar cells to generate novel contrasts uncovering the spatial dynamics of charge carrier transport, recombination losses, and material restructuring.








Abstract
The instability of metal halide perovskites limits the commercialization of solar cells despite their impressive efficiencies. This instability, driven by photo‐induced ion migration, leads to material restructuring, defect formation, degradation, and defect healing. However, these same “unwanted” properties enable to propose Correlation Clustering Imaging (CLIM), a technique that detects local photoluminescence (PL) fluctuations through wide‐field fluorescence microscopy. It is shown that such fluctuations are present in high‐quality perovskites and their corresponding solar cells. CLIM successfully visualizes the polycrystalline grain structure in perovskite films, closely matching electron microscopy images. The analysis of fluctuations reveals a dominant metastable defect responsible for the fluctuations. In solar cells in short‐circuit conditions, these fluctuations are significantly larger, and corresponding correlated regions extend up to 10 micrometers, compared to 2 micrometers in films. It is proposed that the regions resolved by CLIM in solar cells possess a common pool of charge extraction channels, which fluctuate and cause PL to vary. Since PL fluctuations reflect non‐radiative recombination processes, CLIM provides valuable insights into the structural and functional dynamics of carrier transport, ion migration, defect behavior, and recombination losses. CLIM offers a non‐invasive approach to understanding luminescent materials and devices in operando, utilizing contrasts based on previously untapped properties.

<title>Slide‐Ring Structured Stress‐Electric Coupling Hydrogel Microspheres for Low‐Loss Transduction Between Tissues</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A stress‐electric coupling hydrogel microsphere is developed to restore low‐loss transduction between tissues. The synergistic effects of the molecular slippage mechanism of slide‐ring structure, the conjugated π‐electron movement of polypyrrole, and the piezoelectric properties of barium titanate minimize the energy loss during electromechanical conversion between tissues, enhance chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells and remodel inflammatory microenvironment, thereby promoting osteoarthritis treatment.








Abstract
High transductive loss at tissue injury sites impedes repair. The high dissipation characteristics in the electromechanical conversion of piezoelectric biomaterials pose a challenge. Therefore, supramolecular engineering and microfluidic technology is utilized to introduce slide‐ring polyrotaxane and conductive polypyrrole to construct stress‐electric coupling hydrogel microspheres. The molecular slippage mechanism of slide‐ring structure stores and releases mechanical energy, reducing mechanical loss, the piezoelectric barium titanate enables stress‐electricity conversion, and conjugated π‐electron movement in conductive network improves the internal electron transfer efficiency of microspheres, thereby reducing the loss in stress‐electricity conversion for the first time. Compared to traditional piezoelectric hydrogel microspheres, the stress‐electric coupling efficiency of low‐dissipation microspheres increased by 2.3 times, and the energy dissipation decreased to 43%. At cellular level, electrical signals generated by the microspheres triggered Ca2+ influx into stem cells and upregulated the cAMP signaling pathways, promoting chondrogenic differentiation. Enhanced electrical signals induced macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype, reshaping inflammation and promoting tissue repair. In vivo, the low‐dissipation microspheres restored low‐loss transduction between tissues, alleviated cartilage damage, improved behavioral outcomes, and promoted the treatment of osteoarthritis in rats. Therefore, this study proposes a new strategy for restoring low‐loss transduction between tissues, particularly in mechanically sensitive tissues.

<title>An Adaptable Structure of Metal‐Organic Framework Glass Interlayer Enables Superior Performance in Aqueous Zinc‐Ion Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, the metal‐organic framework (MOF) glass, i.e., Zn‐ZIF62 glass, is used to overcome the inadequate structural stability and rapid failure of the Zn‐ZIF62 crystal. When prepared as an artificial interlayer on the Zn metal anode, the heightened configuration freedom of MOF glass endows the stress‐resisted ion transport and the extended Zn2+ ion diffusion pathway, thus achieving high‐performance aqueous zinc‐ion batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of safe and cost‐effective aqueous zinc‐ion batteries is enhanced by the metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess tunable porous structures and chemical compositions that can facilitate the desolvation and transport of Zn2+ ions at the anode interface. However, ensuring the structural stability and operational life of crystalline MOFs in batteries remains a challenge. Here, a breakthrough is presented in tackling this dilemma. A MOF glass interlayer, specifically the ZIF‐62 glass interlayer, is designed and fabricated for the Zn anode. The integration of this interlayer endows the Zn anode with a remarkable cyclic lifespan. It also achieves outstanding cyclability in Zn||MnO2 full‐cell with limited Zn excess, showing no capacity decay after 600 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, and in a Zn||iodine pouch battery with a mass loading of 12.85 mg cm−2. This superior cyclicity is attributed to the ease of distortion of Zn[ligand]4 tetrahedra and the reduced likelihood of disconnection between adjacent tetrahedra within the glass interlayer, as compared to its crystalline counterpart. The unique structure of ZIF‐62 glass provides an increased degree of configurational freedom, allowing it to withstand mechanical stress and extend the Zn2+ ion diffusion pathway. This ensures high cycling stability and rapid interfacial diffusion kinetics.

This paper explores ultra‐flexible silicon nanomembrane synaptic transistors on polyethylene terephthalate substrates, which maintain stable electrical performance after 10 000 bending cycles at a 2.2 mm curvature radius. These devices effectively emulate synaptic functions with high linearity, achieving 93.2% accuracy in handwritten digit recognition, underscoring their suitability for flexible neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
The increasing demand for mobile artificial intelligence applications has elevated edge computing to a prominent research area. Silicon materials, renowned for their excellent electrical properties, are extensively utilized in traditional electronic devices. However, the development of silicon materials for flexible neuromorphic computing devices encounters great challenges. To address these limitations, ultrasoft silicon nanomembranes have emerged as a focal point due to their capability to preserve the superior electrical properties of silicon while providing substantial mechanical flexibility and interfacial tunability. Despite these advantages, difficulties remain in the transfer process of silicon nanomembranes and their integration for flexible synaptic transistors. In this work, an organic–inorganic hybrid polyimide‐Al2O3 dielectric layer has been designed for synaptic behavior grown by an atomic layer deposition process, and integrated with a silicon nanomembrane to realize highly flexible synaptic transistors. These transistors demonstrate stable electrical performance even after undergoing 10 000 bending cycles at an extreme curvature radius of 2.2 mm. Furthermore, the silicon nanomembrane transistors effectively emulate synaptic functions, exhibiting exceptional linearity in their long‐term characteristics, making them suitable for the application scenarios of detecting subtle signals. When applied to handwritten digit recognition simulations, these synaptic transistors have achieved a high accuracy rate of 93.2%.

<title>Multifunctional Quasi‐Homogeneous Catalysts as a New Catalytic Strategy to Boost the Performance of Li‐O2 Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multifunctional quasi‐homogeneous catalyst strategy with Ru‐loaded amino‐phenanthroline‐based carbonized polymer dots (RuApCPDs) well‐dispersed in the electrolyte is developed. Together with the ability to facilitate Li2O2 formation and decomposition, modify electrolytes, and protect Li metal anode, RuApCPDs render Li‐O2 batteries with comprehensively improved performance, offering brand‐new catalyst design strategies for Li‐O2 batteries.








Abstract
Li‐O2 batteries have been considered as a kind of prospective next‐generation batteries due to their ultrahigh energy densities. However, limited capacities, high charge overpotentials, and short lifetime are troubling obstacles for realizing their real‐world implementation. Common strategies, including introducing solid‐state catalysts (SSCs) and redox mediators (RMs), are insufficient to solve these issues. Herein, Ru‐loaded amino‐phenanthroline‐based carbonized polymer dots (RuApCPDs) integrating the catalytic activity of SSCs with the mobility of RMs have been designed to behave as quasi‐homogeneous catalysts in the electrolyte. Their mobile nature can ensure the avoidance of complete coverage of active sites, and the catalytic ability decreases the charge overpotential through co‐deposition with the discharge products. Additionally, the RuApCPDs can also adjust the Li+ solvation structure and well protect the Li metal anodes with high stability. As a result, the introduction of RuApCPDs leads to a fivefold increase in discharge capacity, a low charge voltage of 3.75 V, and a running life of 168 cycles (79 cycles without RuApCPDs). The multifunctional quasi‐homogeneous catalyst developed here demonstrates its advantageous potential as a new catalytic strategy for bringing Li‐O2 batteries to become a viable technology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) coating on natural graphite (NG) anodes improves fast‐charging capability and cycling performance in lithium‐ion batteries. The MoS2‐NG anode reduces charging time and interfacial resistance by modifying the SEI layer, achieving an 80% state of charge in 14.7 minutes, making it ideal for electric vehicles.








Abstract
During fast‐charging, uneven lithium plating on the surface of commercial graphite anode impedes the electrochemical performance of lithium‐ion batteries, causing a safety issue. The formation of a passivation layer, the solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI), due to side reactions with the organic electrolyte, correlates with long‐term cycling performance under fast‐charging conditions, necessitating comprehensive analysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) coating on natural graphite (NG) modulates the properties of the SEI layer, enabling reduction of the charging time and the enhancement of long‐term cycling performance. MoS2 spontaneously transforms into Li2S and Mo nanoclusters through intercalation and conversion with Li+, altering the chemical composition and stability of the SEI layer on the NG, promoting faster Li+ transport, and reducing interfacial resistance. The MoS2‐NG anode shows improved fast‐charging capability and cycling performance under 3.0 C‐charging and 1.0 C‐discharging over 300 cycles without compromising energy density. In the full‐cell configuration, a charging time of 14.7 min at 80% state of charge is achieved, making it suitable for electric vehicle applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Aluminum doping strategy is used to form less aggregated structural domains, creating a favorable environment for the precipitation of nanoscale polycrystalline CaSiO3. Through the process of anomalous grain growth, the nanoscale α‐CaSiO3 crystals are fully absorbed, rearranged, and transformed into micrometer‐sized single‐crystalline β‐CaSiO3. The highly ordered layered structure of β‐CaSiO3 provides efficient pathways for ion and electron transport, reducing its dielectric constant, while the single‐crystalline structure enhances the mechanical properties of the electronic substrate.








Abstract
β‐CaSiO3 based glass‐ceramics are among the most reliable materials for electronic packaging. However, developing a CaSiO3 glass‐ceramic substrate with both high strength (>230 MPa) and low dielectric constant (<5) remains challenging due to its polycrystalline nature. The present work has succeeded in synthesizing single‐crystalline β‐CaSiO3 for a high‐performance glass‐ceramic substrate. This is accomplished by introducing Al3+ into the CaO‐B2O3‐SiO2 glass system, and by optimizing the sintering condition. Al3+ doping facilitates a heterogeneous network structure that energetically favors the precipitation of polycrystalline particles, including nanosized β‐CaSiO3 crystals and sub‐nanosized α‐CaSiO3 crystals. As the sintering temperature increases, the nano α‐CaSiO3 crystals (2–10 nm) are gradually absorbed by the β‐CaSiO3 crystals. Through atomic rearrangement, α‐CaSiO3 crystals transform into micrometer‐sized single crystal β‐CaSiO3 (1–2 µm) with layered structure. The low temperature co‐fired β‐CaSiO3 glass‐ceramics exhibit exceptional properties, including a low dielectric constant of 4.04, a low dielectric loss of 3.15 × 10−3 at 15 GHz, and a high flexural strength of 256 MPa. This work provides a new strategy for fabricating high‐performance single‐crystalline glass‐ceramics for electronic packaging and other applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work demonstrates sunlight‐triggered perpetual flipping of halide perovskite nanoplatelets between stacked and scattered configurations, under light and dark, respectively. The photo‐switchable mechanical response is driven by sulfide linkage dynamics and accompanied by a brown‐to‐red color change. The switchable control over electric current and reversible topographical oscillations offers possibilities for nanorobotics, nanoscale switches, and sensors.








Abstract
Advancements in stimuli‐driven nanoactuators necessitate the discovery of photo‐switchable, self‐contained semiconductor nanostructures capable of precise mechanical responses. The reversible assembly of 0D Cs3Bi2I9 halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) between stacked and scattered configurations are demonstrated under light and dark, respectively. This sunlight‐triggered perpetual flipping of the NPLs, occurring in less than a minute, is associated with a color change between brown and red. The photomechanical response is driven by the formation and cleavage of sulfide linkages at the NPL surface. In the stacked configuration, various stacking modes create moiré superstructures, enhancing the interlayer charge distribution, and increasing the electronic conductivity and optical absorbance. This leads to a decrease in exciton binding energy from 247 meV for scattered NPLs to 162 meV for stacked NPLs, resulting in a 3.5‐fold enhancement in dark current for the stacked NPL films. The switchable control over color and electric current is continuously reversible and retraceable, exhibiting a minor memory effect observed during extended cycling. The self‐flipping NPL nanoactuators demonstrate reversible mechanical responses, with topographical oscillations ranging from 14 nm in scattered NPLs to 50 nm in the vertically stacked configuration. This seamless reversible nano‐assembly with color interchangeability offers numerous possibilities for nanorobotics, nanoscale switches, and sensors.

<title>Directional Chiral Exciton Emission via Topological Polarization Singularities in all Van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Low‐symmetry metasurfaces directly patterned in WS2 thin film engender topological polarization singularities in the momentum space, which strongly interact with the exciton emission from the heterogeneously integrated monolayer MoSe2. Consequently, exciton emission with controllable chirality and directionality is achieved by combining both strong exciton emission and optical field manipulation in all van der Waals metasurfaces fully based on 2D materials.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with strong exciton effects have enabled diverse light emitting devices, however, their Ångstrom thickness makes it challenging to efficiently manipulate exciton emission by themselves. Although their nanostructured multi‐layer counterparts can effectively manipulate optical field at deep subwavelength thickness scale, these indirect band gap multi‐layer TMDs are lack of strong luminescence, hindering their applications in light emitting devices. Here, the integration of monolayer TMDs is presented with nanostructured multi‐layer TMDs, combining both strong exciton emission and optical manipulation in a single ultra‐thin platform. Leveraging the topological polarization singularities in the all van der Waals metasurfaces, chiral exciton emission is experimentally demonstrated whose directionality can be controlled by tailoring metasurface's symmetry. These results provide an approach that can realize exciton emitting devices fully based on 2D materials with controllable polarization and directionality, and may unfold a new avenue for multi‐functional 2D semiconductor light sources.

<title>Voltage‐Induced Bromide Redox Enables Capacity Restoration of Fast‐Charging Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The bromide (Br−/Br3−) redox couple is successfully activated and maximized in 2 mm lithium bromide containing electrolyte via voltage control strategy to function as de‐passivaion reagent to react with Li2O and wrapped Li0 species, which provide more accessible Li+ ions and restore the decayed capacity of fast‐charging LiFePO4||Graphite cells.








Abstract
Fast‐charging lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are essential for electric vehicles (EVs) to compete with conventional gasoline ones in terms of charging viability, yet the aggressive capacity drop in fast‐charging scenarios gives rise to concerns regarding durability and sustainability. Herein, it is clarified that for fast‐charging batteries, the excessive lithium (Li) plating on graphite anode inevitably brings capacity fading, and the concurrent accumulation of Li2O‐dominant passivation species that form dead Li is the main reason for their poor rechargeability. To refresh the passivated graphite, a voltage‐induced activation mechanism is developed to leverage bromide (Br−/Br3−) redox couple for Li2O and isolated Li0 activation in situ. Along with a tiny amount of lithium bromide (LiBr) added into the electrolyte, the cut‐off voltage of activation processes is controlled to initiate and maximize the effectiveness of Br−/Br3− redox couple. The capacity of degraded fast‐charging cells can increase from lower than 30 to ≈118 mAh g−1 before and after the activation, respectively. Notably, the process is not one‐off; a subsequent activation is feasible. For the same battery that suffered from another round of fast charging, this design still restores the reversible capacity to ≈100 mAh g−1. Such a voltage‐mediated mechanism can effectively prolong the service life of practical fast‐charging batteries.

The system demonstrates regenerative ATP synthesis through repeated light on/off cycles, enabling the biocoupling of monosaccharides into disaccharides and showcasing a sustainable approach for converting solar energy into chemical energy.








Abstract
Biomimetic photosynthesis, which leverages nanomaterials with light‐responsive capabilities, represents an innovative approach for replicating natural photosynthetic processes for green and sustainable energy conversion. In this study, a covalent‐organic framework (COF)‐based artificial photosynthesis system is realized through the co‐assembly of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and a light‐responsive proton generator onto an imine‐based COF, RT‐COF‐1. This system demonstrates an ATP production rate of 0.64 µmol ATP per mg protein within 90 s of light exposure and, for the first time, exhibites regenerative ATP production through multiple light on/off cycles. Furthermore, the ATP generated by the system facilitates the biocoupling of monosaccharides into disaccharides, confirming the hybrid system's capability to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of organic molecules. This approach shows significant potential for renewable bioenergy generation, offering precise and reliable control over biochemical processes through artificial photosynthesis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study unravels a self‐wrinkled mechanically adaptive patterned surface (SWMAPS) by a one‐step UV‐curing and self‐wrinkling technique. Thanks to the mechanically adaptive performance of the bionic wrinkled microstructure, the SWMAPS with both random and programmable‐irradiated wrinkles can withstand more than 600 cycles of reciprocating friction, which establishes a new field of mechanically adaptive patterned surface for mechanical enhancement.








Abstract
Providing mechanically adaptive performance to surfaces is significant in preserving materials from damage in variable environments, however, it has rarely been studied. Inspired by the mechanically adaptive behaviors of the surface microstructure on the carapace of desert scorpions and bark of desert tamarisks, a self‐wrinkled mechanically adaptive patterned surface (SWMAPS) using one‐step UV‐curing and self‐wrinkling technique is reported. Because of the fluorinated polyurethane photo‐initiator formed by self‐assembly at the top surface, UV‐induced photo‐crosslinking can spontaneously generate a gradient‐crosslinked structure and wrinkled patterns with different morphology. With mechanically adaptive behavior originating from self‐assembled fluorinated polyurethane photo‐initiators, gradient‐crosslinked structures, and self‐wrinkled patterns, the SWMAPS remains intact under 600 cycles of reciprocating friction with little variation in the coefficient of friction and water contact angle. The SWMAPS prepared by programmable UV irradiation maintains integral under 1800 cycles of reciprocating friction with a stable friction coefficient. Furthermore, the SWMAPS is fabricated with high efficiency, regulated morphology, good surface mechanical properties, and self‐recovery performance. This strategy establishes a new field of mechanically adaptive patterned surfaces, which significantly improves durability and prolongs the service life of materials in variable environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, trimethylgermanium chloride (TGC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution. Comprehensive experiments find that TGC triggers the successive interactions involving the hydrolysis of Ge─Cl bond forming Ge─OH group, then forming O─H···N/O─H···I bonds. Benefiting from these successive interactions, the TGC‐treated device realizes a PCE of 26.03% and 26.38% for the conventional (n‐i‐p) and inverted (p‐i‐n) FACsPbI3 PSCs with 3000 h unattenuated operation.








Abstract
The rapidly increased efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) indicates their broad commercial prospects, but the commercialization of perovskite faces complex optimization processes and stability issues. In this work, a simple optimized strategy is developed by the addition of trimethylgermanium chloride (TGC) into FACsPbI3 precursor solution. TGC triggers the successive interactions in perovskite solution and film, involving the hydrolysis of vulnerable Ge─Cl bond forming Ge─OH group, then forming the hydrogen bonds (O─H···N and O─H···I) with FAI. These successive interactions effectively safeguard FA+ from decomposition, accelerate crystallization, restrict ion migration, and passivate film defects. Thus, a high‐quality perovskite is obtained with the super‐hydrophobic surface, maintaining the light‐active phase (α‐phase) even after exposure to high‐humidity air (RH: 85%) for 10 days. Consequently, the TGC‐treated conventional (n‐i‐p) and inverted (p‐i‐n) FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve 26.03%‐ and 26.38%‐ efficiencies, respectively, retaining unattenuated operation initial efficiency after tracking at the maximum power point (MPP) under illumination for 3000 h.

In this work, by employing multiscale modeling, the highly intrinsic anisotropic mechanical properties of the cell wall due to the layer‐by‐layer stacked graphene sheets are uncovered, and multiscale joint strengthening strategies are proposed to improve fatigue performance of CGA.








Abstract
Despite fatigue free of monolayer graphene, its assemblies, like cellular graphene aerogels (CGA), are usually suffering of frequent fatigue and inherent strength degradation in repeated loading. In this work, by employing multiscale modeling, the highly intrinsic anisotropic mechanical properties of the cell wall due to the layer‐by‐layer stacked graphene sheets are uncovered, which easily trigger the unique skeleton joints damage during repeated loading and contribute the primary fatigue mechanism of CGA. Conversely, multiscale joint strengthening strategies are proposed by interlayer crosslinking and joint curvation, improving the interlayer interaction, and decreasing interlayer stress during compression, respectively, so as to effectively suppress joint damage to improve fatigue performance of CGA. This work not only clarifies the underlying fatigue mechanism of 2D cellular materials but also highlights optimal design strategies for developing anti‐fatigue graphene cellular structures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study demonstrated that injectable force‐electric hydrogel microspheres generate sustained electrical stimulation under pressure, actively inducing the aggregation of specific cell types. At the microscale, this process facilitates precise regulation of calcium ion influx, guiding the differentiation fate of targeted cells. Overall, this piezoelectric hydrogel offers a novel method for the precise repair of cartilage injuries.








Abstract
Electrical stimulation enhances cellular activity, promoting tissue regeneration and repair. However, specific cells and maintaining a stable energy supply are challenges for precise cell electrical stimulation therapy. Here, force‐electric conversion hydrogel microspheres (Piezo@CR MPs) is devloped to induce specific stem cell aggregation and promote chondrogenic differentiation through localized electrical stimulation. These MPs contain barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles embedded in hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel MPs, with a polydopamine (pDA) coating bound to stem cell recruitment peptides (CR) via π‐π conjugation and electrostatic forces. Piezo@CR MPs convert pressure (ultrasound) into electrical stimulation, directing BMSCs for colonization and chondrogenesis. In vitro, directionally migrated stem cells almost covered the Piezo@CR MP surface, generating up to 451 mV of electrical output that enhanced chondrogenic differentiation. In a rabbit osteochondral defect model, Piezo@CR MPs promoted cartilage regeneration, nearly resembling native cartilage. In a rat osteoarthritis model, they reduced cartilage degeneration and improved behavioral outcomes. Additionally, Piezo@CR MPs promoted cartilage regeneration by driving the influx of extracellular calcium and activating the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, Piezo@CR MPs offer a new approach for precise cell type electrical stimulation therapy in treating of cartilage injuries and degeneration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A compositionally downgraded BiFeO3 is developed to produce enhanced self‐poling by introducing compressive strain. Utilizing this large‐area film over a 6‐inch wafer, pMUTs with 6 × 6 arrays at the device level are designed and micromanufactured. pMUT demonstrates sensitive converse piezoelectric response, even at a low frequency of 500 Hz and a high temperature of 200 °C.








Abstract
Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers (pMUTs), especially those using lead‐free materials, are crucial next‐generation microdevices for precise actuation and sensing, driving advancements in medical, industrial, and environmental applications. Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is emerging as a promising lead‐free piezoelectric material to replace Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 in pMUTs. Despite its potential, the integration of BiFeO3 thin films into pMUTs has been hindered by poling issues. Here, a BiFeO3 heterostructure compositionally downgraded with Gd doping is developed to introduce compressive strain, resulting in strong self‐poling. Utilizing a large‐area self‐poled thin film over an entire 6‐inch wafer, a pMUT with a 6 × 6 array at the device level is designed and evaluated. At a resonant frequency of 21 kHz, the dynamic vibration displacement can reach 24.0 nm. At 500 Hz, far below the resonant frequency of 21 kHz, the pMUT also displays sensitive converse piezoelectric response, even at a high temperature of 200 °C. This work represents a significant breakthrough in lead‐free BiFeO3 thin film for practical sensing applications, paving the way for the transformation of macro‐transducers into next‐generation functional microdevices.

<title>Antifouling Immunomodulatory Copolymer Architectures That Inhibit the Fibrosis of Implants</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Novel copolymer coatings dramatically reduce the formation of fibrotic tissue on medical implants, extending device longevity. In vivo screening reveals that optimizing copolymer architecture is critical for synergizing state‐of‐the‐art antifouling and immunomodulatory antifibrotic moieties.








Abstract
Immune reactions to medical implants often lead to encapsulation by fibrotic tissue and impaired device function. This process is thought to initiate by protein adsorption, which enables immune cells to attach and mount an inflammatory response. Previously, several antifibrotic materials have been either designed to reduce protein adsorption or discovered via high‐throughput screens (HTS) to favorably regulate inflammation. The present work introduces antifouling immunomodulatory (AIM) copolymer coatings, which combine both strategies to effectively enhance implant protection. AIM copolymers synergistically integrate zwitterionic moieties to resist protein fouling, HTS‐derived antifibrotics for immunomodulation, and silane monomers for grafting to diverse substrates including elastomers, ceramics, and metals. Interestingly, simply combining these monomers into conventional random or block copolymer architectures yielded no significant advantage over homopolymers. By contrast, an unusual polymer chain architecture — a zwitterionic block flanked by a mixed zwitterionic immunomodulatory segment — showed superior fibrosis resistance in both peritoneal and subcutaneous sites over one month in immunocompetent mice. This architecture also improved the performance of two different HTS‐derived antifibrotic monomers, suggesting that tailoring AIM architectures may broadly complement immunomodulatory chemistries and provide a versatile approach to improving implant longevity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A worm‐like robot composed of modular, self‐contained actuators is developed. The modules with embodied zinc‐iodide redox flow batteries are fabricated using a novel bonding method, allowing for reliable power supply over extended periods more than 35 h. Each module operates independently to create various gait patterns, demonstrating efficient locomotion.








Abstract
The adaptable, modular structure of muscles, combined with their confluent energy storage allows for numerous architectures found in nature: trunks, tongues, and tentacles to name some more complex ones. To provide an artificial analog to this biological soft muscle, a self‐powered, soft hydrostat actuator is presented. As an example of how to use these modules, a worm robot is assembled where the near totality of the body stores electrochemical potential. The robot exhibits an extremely high system energy density (51.3 J g−1), using a redox flow battery motif, with a long theoretical operational range of more than 100 m on a single charge. The innovation lies in the battery pouch, fabricated with a dry‐adhesion method, automatically bonding Nafion separators to a silicone‐urethane copolymer body. These pouches contain anolyte within a hydrostat pod filled with catholyte, increasing current density per pod. Each pod has a motor and tendon actuator for radial compression and expansion. By linking these self‐contained pods in series, the robot worm is created that automatically navigates an enclosed, curved path. This high‐capacity soft worm also climbs up and down a vertical pipe, using a two‐anchor crawling gait, with an extra payload equivalent to 1.5 times its body weight.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study reports a novel silk gland biosynthetic system for efficient expression and large‐scale production of exogenous protein with bioactivity in silk fibers of transgenic silkworms, realizing cost‐effective fabrications of fluorescent and antibacterial silk fibroin biomaterials, and providing an opportunity for genetic functionalization of silk fibroin to broaden the utility of this biomaterial for a range of potential applications.








Abstract
Long historical evolution and domestication endow silkworms with the super ability to synthesize and secrete massive silk proteins using silk glands. The major component of this secretion consists of silk fibroin, considered a promising biomaterial for tissue repairs and engineering. To further expand the utility of this unique protein, there is a continuing need for silk fibroin functionalization. Here, a highly‐efficient Fib‐HEXP biosynthetic system is established to synthesize massive recombinant RFP in silk fibers using transgenic silkworms, which accounts for ≈7.86% of silk mass and achieves fabrication of fluorescent silk fibroin (SF) biomaterials. The universality of the Fib‐HEXP system is validated by genetic engineering glucose oxidase (GOx) functionalized silk fibers for fabricating GOx‐SF hydrogels with antimicrobial activity to promote healing of infected diabetic wounds in mouse through the enzyme‐catalyzed reaction of glucose to gluconic acid and H2O2. These findings demonstrate that the Fib‐HEXP system provides an opportunity for genetic functionalization of SF to broaden the utility of this biomaterial for a range of potential applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Transparent Al2O3‐LaMgAl11O19: Mn2+ composite ceramic is fabricated via vacuum sintering, producing high‐color‐purity (95.4%) green emission with FWHM of 24 nm, as well as superior thermal and moisture and laser irradiation stability. This enables to construction of high‐performance laser‐driven projection display with a record‐breaking color gamut beyond 100% Rec.2020.








Abstract
Laser‐driven projection displays face a critical challenge in developing laser‐excitable and high‐performance narrowband green emitters. Herein, new Al2O3‐LaMgAl11O19: Mn2+ (Al2O3‐LMA: Mn2+) transparent composite ceramics are reported via high‐temperature vacuum sintering, which produces a high‐color‐purity (95.4%) green emission with full width at half maximum of 24 nm and superior thermal and moisture and laser irradiation stability. These are attributed to low electron‐phonon couple, weak crystal‐field effect, an individual lattice location of Mn2+ activators in high structural rigid host, and the incorporation of a high‐thermal‐conductivity Al2O3 secondary phase. As a result, the composite ceramics are demonstrated as an attractive color converter with a high external quantum efficiency (38%) and absorption coefficient (53%), which ensures a luminous flux of 2012 lm @40.0 W, a luminous efficacy of 67.7 lm W−1, and a green light conversion efficiency of 20.3% upon blue laser irradiation. This enables to construct a brand‐new laser‐driven prototype display with a record color gamut beyond Rec.2020 standard (100.8%), outperforming commercial YAG: Ce3+ and β‐SiAlON: Eu2+. This exploration in ultra‐narrowband green luminescent materials is poised to accelerate the development of “ideal displays” for laser‐driven projection display technology.

<title>Realizing C–C Coupling via Accumulation of C1 Intermediates within Dual‐Vacancy‐Induced Dipole‐Limited Domain Field to Propel Photoreduction of CO2‐to‐C2 Fuel</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study addresses the challenges of photocatalytic CO2 reduction by introducing C, N dual‐vacancy sites into ultrathin g‐C3N4, forming a localized dipole‐limited domain electric field (DLDF). This design enhances CO2 activation and promotes efficient C–C coupling, leading to high‐yield photocatalytic production of C2H6. The DLDF effect significantly improves electron transferability and stabilizes intermediates, facilitating the multi‐electron reduction processes.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into high‐value‐added C2 fuels remains a tough challenge, mainly due to the insufficient concentration of photogenerated electrons for the instability of C1 intermediates, which often tend to desorb easily and disable to form C─C bonds. In this work, photoreduction of CO2‐to‐C2H6 is successfully achieved by introducing adjacent C, N dual‐vacancy sites within the heptazine rings of ultrathin g‐C3N4, which results in the opening of two neighboring heptazine rings and forms a distinctive dipole‐limited domain field (DLDF) structure. In situ X‐ray photoelectron spectra and in situ fourier transform infrared spectra provide direct evidence of the rapid accumulation and transformation of C1 intermediates, especially CO* and CHO*, within the DLDF. Ab initio molecular dynamics further substantiates the role of DLDF in promoting C–C coupling between CO* and CHO*, through the analysis of interaction trajectories and energy changes of their central atoms, ultimately achieving a high yield of C2H6 up to 57.86 µmol g−1 h−1. It is for the first time to propose the concept of DLDF for significant advancement in photoreduction of CO2‐to‐C2 fuel with the evident breakthrough to address the challenge of coupling carbon‐containing intermediates between active sites, offering new insights for the design of C–C coupling sites in single‐component photocatalysts.

Poly(2‐aminoazulene), featured with a substantial dipole moment and abundant Lewis base amino groups, enhances the adsorption and boosts the reduction of carbon dioxide on Cu surface, yielding impressive ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 68.9% at 1 A cm−2.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into hydrocarbon products emerges as a pivotal sustainable strategy for carbon utilization. Cu‐based catalysts are currently prioritized as the most effective means for this process, yet it remains a long‐term goal to achieve high product selectivity at elevated current densities. This study delved into exploring the influence of a topological poly(2‐aminoazulene) with a substantial dipole moment on modulating the Cu surface dipole field to augment the catalytic activity involved in CO2 reduction. The resulting Cu/poly(2‐aminoazulene) heterojunction showcases a remarkable ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 68.9% even at a substantial current density of 1 A cm−2. Through in situ Raman and in situ Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, poly(2‐aminoazulene)‐modified Cu electrode exhibits a heightened concentration of intermediates as compared to the bare Cu, proving advantageous for C−C dimerization. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the reduced energy barrier for C−C dimerization, and meanwhile impeding hydrogen evolution reaction on Cu/poly(2‐aminoazulene) heterojunction, which are beneficial to CO2 reduction. The catalyst design in this study, incorporating dipole moment considerations, not only investigates the influence of dipole moment on electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction but also pioneers an innovative strategy to augment catalytic activity by elevating the micro‐concentration of reactants on catalyst surfaces.

<title>Triplet Exciton Sensitization of Silicon Mediated by Defect States in Hafnium Oxynitride</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work investigates the influence of hafnium oxynitride interlayer composition on triplet exciton sensitization of singlet fission solar cells. Nitrogen content in hafnium oxynitride layers is correlated with enhanced sensitization. Calculation results reveal that defects in hafnium oxynitride interlayers with higher nitrogen content introduce states close to the band‐edge of silicon, which can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process.








Abstract
Singlet exciton fission has the potential to increase the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells beyond the conventional single junction limit. Perhaps the largest obstacle to achieving this enhancement is uncertainty about energy coupling mechanisms at the interfaces between silicon and exciton fission materials such as tetracene. Here, the previously reported silicon‐hafnium oxynitride‐tetracene structure is studied and a combination of magnetic‐field‐dependent silicon photoluminescence measurements and density functional theory calculations is used to probe the influence of the interlayer composition on the triplet transfer process across the hafnium oxynitride interlayer. It is found that hafnium oxide interlayers do not show triplet exciton sensitization of silicon, and that nitrogen content in hafnium oxynitride layers is correlated with enhanced sensitization. Calculation results reveal that defects in hafnium oxynitride interlayers with higher nitrogen content introduce states close to the band‐edge of silicon, which can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process. Some defects introduce additional deleterious mid‐gap states, which may explain observed silicon photoluminescence quenching. These results show that band‐edge states can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process, potentially through a sequential charge transfer mechanism.

This study advances electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps by introducing a 3D‐printable anti‐swelling organohydrogel for soft robotics. Using digital light processing (DLP) technology, precise components are fabricated, resulting in a pump with 90.2 kPa pressure and 800 mL min−1 flow rate. A novel organohydrogel with low swelling and excellent mechanical properties enhances pump performance, supporting diverse soft robotics applications.








Abstract
This study introduces advancements in electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps and the development of a 3D‐printable anti‐swelling organohydrogel for soft robotics. Using digital light processing (DLP)technology, precise components with less than 1% size variation are fabricated, enabling a unique manifold pump array. This design achieves an output pressure of 90.2 kPa—18 times higher than traditional configurations—and a flow rate of 800 mL min−1, surpassing previous EHD pumps. To address swelling issues in dielectric liquids, a novel organohydrogel is developed with Young's modulus of 0.33 MPa, 300% stretchability, and a swelling ratio under 10%. Its low swelling is attributed to the shield effect and edge length confinement effect. This durable material ensures consistent pump performance under mechanical stresses like bending and twisting, crucial for dynamic soft robotic environments. These innovations significantly improve EHD pump efficiency and reliability, expanding their potential applications in soft robotics, bioengineering, and vertical farming.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The nonlinear response of spiral 2D transition‐metal dichalcogenides can be tailored on‐demand through novel structural designs (such as aligned‐ and twisted‐triangular spiral nanosheets) with scalable and reproducible method, which is beneficial to the integrated photonics and lab‐on‐a‐chip quantum devices.








Abstract
Spiral transition‐metal dichalcogenides with broken crystal inversion symmetry and significant second‐order nonlinear responses have shown great promise for further nonlinear optical applications. However, various spiral structures will be formed during their synthesis process, their second harmonic generation (SHG) varying with the layer thickness and which of them manifesting the most promising SHG response are still unresolved. Here, the layer‐dependent SHG response is investigated for four representative spiral WS2 with different screw and twist angles, including aligned‐ and twisted‐triangular spiral structures, aligned‐ and twisted‐hexagonal spiral structures, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that both aligned‐ and twisted‐hexagonal spiral WS2 present weak SHG response. In contrast, the SHG signal of the aligned‐triangular spiral WS2 almost quadratically increases with the lift of their thickness, which is two orders of magnitude stronger than hexagonal structures. Moreover, an oscillating layer‐dependence SHG response for twisted‐triangular spiral WS2 has been attributed to the restored inversion symmetry. The underlying mechanism has been explored by the evolution of their crystal symmetry. The results not only disclose that the nonlinear response of the spiral WS2 can be tailored on‐demand through the novel structural designs, but also pave the way to scalable integrated photonics and lab‐on‐a‐chip quantum devices based on spiral layered materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The lead‐free metal halide CPTP2MnBr4 exhibits solvent‐tuned plasticity, enabling the formation of binder‐free thin films without requiring heat treatment. This unique property allows versatile processing into luminescent clay, direct ink writing patterns, and uniform thin layers, overcoming the limitations of conventional binder systems. These characteristics highlight its potential for applications in WLEDs, scintillators, and next‐generation μ‐LED displays.








Abstract
The development of efficient color conversion layers for μ‐LED technology faces significant challenges owing to the limitations of materials that require binders. Binders are typically used to ensure uniform film formation in color‐conversion layers, but they often cause optical losses, increase layer thickness, and introduce long‐term stability issues. To address the limitations of materials requiring binders, cyclopropyltriphenylphosphonium manganese tetrabromide (CPTP2MnBr4) is synthesized, a novel lead‐free metal halide. CPTP2MnBr4 exhibits unique solvent‐based plasticity, which enables the formation of uniform films thinner than those formed with binders without the need for either heat treatment or binders. This approach eliminates the performance degradation typically associated with conventional binder systems such as optical losses and stability issues. Structural and optical analyses confirm its high luminescence efficiency and stability, supporting its potential applications in luminescent clays, direct ink writing, pattern printing, and ink drawing. Moreover, its successful application in white light‐emitting diodes (WLEDs) and scintillators demonstrates that CPTP2MnBr4 can replace traditional binder systems, offering a solution to overcome the technical challenges in next‐generation displays, lighting, and scintillator technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new structural device is constructed through contact engineering, where carbon nanotubes in the electrode area are filled with SbI3 molecular chains, resulting in low contact resistance, high carrier mobility, and an extremely low subthreshold swing.








Abstract
Semiconducting single‐wall carbon nanotubes (s‐SWCNTs) represent one of the most promising materials for surpassing Moore's Law and developing the next generation of electronic devices. Despite numerous developed approaches, reducing the contact resistance of s‐SWCNTs networks remains a significant challenge in achieving further enhancements in electronic performance. In this study, antimony triiodide (SbI3) is efficiently encapsulated within high‐purity s‐SWCNTs films at low temperatures, forming 1D SbI3@s‐SWCNTs vdW heterostructures. The semiconductor–metal transition of individual SbI3@s‐SWCNTs is characterized via sensitive dielectric force microscopy, with the results confirmed through electrical device tests. The electrical behavior transition is attributed to an interlayer charge transfer, as demonstrated by Kelvin probe force microscopy. Moreover, the electrical performance of s‐SWCNTs thin‐film transistors improves significantly with SbI3@s‐SWCNTs networks as contact electrodes. This process reduces the contact resistance between the s‐SWCNTs channel and the electrodes, enhancing electrical performance. Specifically, the contact resistance decreases to one‐third of the original, the carrier mobility increases by ≈10 times, the on‐off ratio exceeds 106, and the subthreshold swing reduces significantly to ≈65 mV dec−1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of inner‐doping‐induced metallization of s‐SWCNTs in the contact region, essential for advancing carbon nanotube electronic devices and circuits.

The hydrolysis of the fabricated calcium disilicide nanoparticles (CSNs) produces anti‐oxidative H2, alkaline Ca(OH)2, and silica. These moieties play significant roles in anti‐oxidation, anti‐inflammatory, and pro‐osteogenesis resulting in considerably outperformed RA therapeutics. The multifunctional performances of CSNs are further confirmed in arthritic mouse and rabbit models, providing an advanced therapeutic strategy against RA with high biocompatibility.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of inflammation homeostasis disorder that dysfunctions the joints. Clinically, medications against RA focus simply on mitigating the focal inflammation, without considering pro‐osteogenesis re‐modeling of the bone microenvironment. In the present work, 2D layered calcium disilicide nanoparticles (CSNs) are fabricated by facile aqueous exfoliation. The hydrolysis of CSNs produces anti‐oxidative H2, alkaline Ca(OH)2, and silica. These moieties play significant roles in anti‐oxidation, anti‐inflammation, and pro‐osteogenesis resulting in considerably better RA therapeutic consequences than anti‐inflammation alone. Hydrogen gas is validated to eliminate excessive hydroxyl radicals and regulate macrophage re‐polarization; the generated Ca(OH)2 can neutralize the acidic microenvironment and inhibit the osteoclast activity; and, the dissolved Ca2+ can effectively complex with phosphates to mineralize Ca3(PO4)2, promoting the osteogenesis of the focal joint. The multifunctional performances of CSNs are further confirmed in arthritic mouse and rabbit models, providing an advanced and robust therapeutic strategy against RA with high biocompatibility and clinical transformable promises.

The hydroxyl‐functionalized atomic‐thin bismuth subcarbonate in situ transformed from bismuth hydroxide nanotubes enables highly efficient and durable carbon dioxide electroreduction into formate. The unique OH‐decoration facilitates active hydrogen supply in near‐neutral electrolytes by enhanced water dissociation and strengthened the adsorption of the critical oxygenated intermediate with highly localized surface electron configuration.








Abstract
Renewable electricity‐driven CO2 electroreduction provides a promising route toward carbon neutrality and sustainable chemical production. Nevertheless, the viability of this route faces constraints of catalytic efficiency and durability in near‐neutral electrolytes at industrial‐scale current densities, mechanistically originating from unfavorable accommodation of *H species from water dissociation. Herein, a new strategy is reported to accelerate water dissociation by the rich surface hydroxyl on bismuth subcarbonate nanosheets in situ electrochemical transformed from bismuth hydroxide nanotube precursors. This catalyst enables the electrosynthesis of formate at current densities up to 1000 mA cm−2 with >96% faradaic efficiencies in flow cells, and a 200 h durable membrane electrode assembly in a dilute near‐neutral environment. Combined kinetic studies, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveal that the atomic thickness strengthens the hydroxyl adsorption, and with a highly localized electron configuration, the hydroxyl‐functionalized surface is more affinitive to oxygenated species, thus lowering the barrier for water dissociation and the crucial hydrogenation step in the proton‐coupled electron transfer from *OCHO to *HCOOH.

Chiral MnO2 supraparticles as renal‐clearance biosensors for dual‐mode in vivo detection of metalloproteinase‐9 in early cancer diagnosis via circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).








Abstract
In this study, polypeptide TGGGPLGVARGKGGC‐induced chiral manganese dioxide supraparticles (MnO2 SPs) are prepared for sensitive quantification of matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP‐9) in vitro and in vivo. The results show that L‐type manganese dioxide supraparticles (L‐MnO2 SPs) exhibited twice the affinity for the cancer cell membrane receptor CD47 (cluster of differentiation, integrin‐associated protein) than D‐type manganese dioxide supraparticles (D‐MnO2 SPs) to accumulate at the tumor site after surface modification of the internalizing arginine‐glycine‐aspartic acid (iRGD) ligand, specifically reacting with the MMP‐9, disassembling into ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs), and efficiently underwent renal clearance. Furthermore, L‐MnO2 facilitates the quantification of MMP‐9 in mouse tumor xenografts, as demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 2 h. A strong linear relationship is observed between MMP‐9 concentration and both CD and MRI intensity, ranging from 0.01 to 10 ng mL−1. The corresponding limits of detection (LOD) are 0.0054 ng mL−1 for CD and 0.0062 ng mL−1 for MRI, respectively. hese SPs provide a new approach for exploring chiral advanced biosensors for early diagnosis of cancer.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
HfRhGe, a promising noncentrosymmetric material for topological superconductivity, exhibits time‐reversal symmetry (TRS)‐protected Weyl topology in its normal state, featuring disconnected Fermi sheets and multiple surface Fermi arcs. It enters a superconducting phase at low temperatures with a TRS‐breaking ground state, evidenced by muon‐spin rotation and relaxation (µSR) measurements, detecting a spontaneous magnetic field offering potential applications in quantum electronics.








Abstract
Weyl semimetals are a novel class of topological materials with unique electronic structures and distinct properties. HfRhGe stands out as a noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetal with unconventional superconducting characteristics. Using muon‐spin rotation and relaxation (µSR) spectroscopy and thermodynamic measurements, a fully gapped superconducting state is identified in HfRhGe that breaks time‐reversal symmetry at the superconducting transition. This breaking can trigger a topological phase transition, as time‐reversal symmetry protects the normal‐state Weyl topology characterized by comprehensive first‐principles calculations. Ginzburg‐Landau analysis suggests an unconventional loop supercurrent superconducting state realized in HfRhGe. The presence of multiple Weyl points near the Fermi level and surface Fermi arcs dispersing across the Fermi level further support HfRhGe as a promising platform for topological superconductivity. Additionally, its noncentrosymmetric nature with time‐reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state suggests that it can exhibit an intrinsic superconducting diode effect, offering novel optical and transport properties, with potential applications in dissipationless quantum electronics.

A novel all‐solid‐state oxide‐ion synaptic transistor is developed, based on a Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 oxide‐ion conductor electrolyte and La0.5Sr0.5FeO3‐δ variable‐resistance electrodes (channel, gate). This synaptic transistor efficiently operates at temperatures compatible with conventional electronics, exhibiting key synaptic behaviors with low energy consumption and high endurance. Integrated into an artificial neural network simulation, it achieved 96% accuracy in handwritten digit recognition, demonstrating significant potential for neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
Neuromorphic hardware facilitates rapid and energy‐efficient training and operation of neural network models for artificial intelligence. However, existing analog in‐memory computing devices, like memristors, continue to face significant challenges that impede their commercialization. These challenges include high variability due to their stochastic nature. Microfabricated electrochemical synapses offer a promising approach by functioning as an analog programmable resistor based on deterministic ion‐insertion mechanisms. Here, an all‐solid‐state oxide‐ion synaptic transistor is developed, employing Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 as a superior oxide‐ion conductor electrolyte and La0.5Sr0.5FeO3‐δ as a variable‐resistance channel able to efficiently operate at temperatures compatible with conventional electronics. This transistor exhibits essential synaptic behaviors such as long‐ and short‐term potentiation, paired‐pulse facilitation, and post‐tetanic potentiation, mimicking fundamental properties of biological neural networks. Key criteria for efficient neuromorphic computing are satisfied, including excellent linear and symmetric synaptic plasticity, low energy consumption per programming pulse, and high endurance with minimal cycle‐to‐cycle variation. Integrated into an artificial neural network (ANN) simulation for handwritten digit recognition, the presented synaptic transistor achieved a 96% accuracy on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset, illustrating the effective implementation of the device in ANNs. These findings demonstrate the potential of oxide‐ion based synaptic transistors for effective implementation in analog neuromorphic computing based on iontronics.

<title>An “Outer Piezoelectric and Inner Epigenetic” Logic‐Gated PANoptosis for Osteosarcoma Sono‐Immunotherapy and Bone Regeneration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
3D‐printed biomaterials equipped with an “outer AND inner” logic gate are developed by integrating porous piezoelectric sonosensitizers with bioactive glass scaffolds. Ultrasound, acting as the “outer” input signal, can generate reactive oxygen species, and bioactive drugs loaded in sonosensitizers serve as the “inner” input signal to implement epigenetic demethylation regulation. Combining the AND logic‐triggered effects, cancer‐specific PANoptosis activation is achieved to boost antitumor immune response. Thus, the biomaterial platform enables enhanced sono‐piezoelectric immunotherapy for osteosarcoma, along with related antibacterial effects and bone defect repair.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of PANoptosis, a newly defined cell death pathway encompassing pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, is highly desired to achieve safer cancer immunotherapy with tumor‐specific inflammatory responses and minimal side effects. Nonetheless, this objective remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an “AND” logic‐gated strategy for accurately localized PANoptosis activation, utilizing composite 3D‐printed bioactive glasses scaffolds integrated with epigenetic regulator‐loaded porous piezoelectric SrTiO3 nanoparticles is proposed. The “logic‐gated” strategy is co‐programmed by an “outer” input signal of exogenous ultrasound irradiation to produce reactive oxygen species and an “inner” input signal of acid tumor microenvironment to ensure the epigenetic demethylation regulation, guaranteeing the tumor‐specific PANoptosis. Specifically, immunogenic PANoptosis triggers dendritic cell maturation and cytotoxic T cell activation, amplifying antitumor immune responses and significantly suppressing osteosarcoma growth, with a suppression rate of ≈73.47 ± 5.2%. In addition, the well‐known bioactivities of Sr‐doped scaffolds expedite osteogenic differentiation and reinforce bone regeneration. Therefore, this work provides a paradigm of logic‐gated sono‐piezoelectric biomaterial platform with concurrently exogenous/endogenous activated PANoptosis for controlled sono‐immunotherapy of osteosarcoma, and related bone defects repair.

<title>In Situ Conversion of Artificial Proton‐Rich Shell to Inorganic Maskant Toward Stable Single‐Crystal Ni‐Rich Cathode</title>

In situ conversion of proton‐rich shell to sub‐nano F‐&amp;P‐maskant, which protects the single‐crystal Ni‐rich cathode from the attack of electrolyte in the long‐term cycling and enables superhigh capacity retention of 83% after 800 cycles.








Abstract
Single‐crystal high‐nickel oxide with an integral structure can prevent intergranular cracks and the associated detrimental reactions. Yet, its low surface‐to‐volume ratio makes surficial degradation a more critical factor in electrochemical performance. Herein, artificial proton‐rich (ammonium bicarbonate) shell is successfully introduced on the nickel‐rich LiNi0.92Co0.06Mn0.02O2 single crystals for in situ electrochemically conversing into inorganic maskant to enhance stability of cathode. The process is that the surficial enriched proton, once released from the ammonium bicarbonate shell (proton reservoir) during 1st charge, is immediately captured by LiPF6, in situ electrochemically conversing to LiF and Li3PO4 sub‐nano particle dense maskant (sub‐nano F‐&amp;P‐maskant). The in situ formed compact nano F‐&amp;P‐maskant significantly resists the cathode against electrolyte attack and improves the surface stability of particles during long‐term cycling. Consequently, this surface modification enables 95% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a high voltage of 4.5 V in the half cell and 83% capacity retention after 800 cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates a strategy for reconstructing the protective layer using the rational design of surficial enriched proton shells for advanced lithium batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multidirectional sliding ferroelectricity in γ‐InSe with a tunable bulk photovoltaic effect due to the existence of multiple polarization states is reported. The multidirectional sliding ferroelectricity is predicted by the theoretical calculations and multiple domain walls are observed experimentally. The multidirectional sliding ferroelectric polarization paves the path to explore novel optoelectronic applications like real‐time imaging and neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Through the stacking technique of 2D materials, the interfacial polarization can be switched by an interlayer sliding, known as sliding ferroelectricity, which is advantageous in ultra‐thin thickness, high switching speed, and high fatigue resistance. However, uncovering the relationship between the sliding path and the polarization state in rhombohedral‐stacked materials remains a challenge, which is the key to 2D sliding ferroelectricity. Here, layer‐dependent multidirectional sliding ferroelectricity in rhombohedral‐stacked InSe (γ‐InSe) is reported via dual‐frequency resonance tracking piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy. The graphene/γ‐InSe/graphene tunneling device exhibits a tunable bulk photovoltaic effect with a photovoltaic current density of ≈15 mA cm−2 due to multiple polarization states. The generation of dome‐like domain walls is observed experimentally, which is attributed to the multidirectional sliding‐induced domains based on the theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the ferroelectric polarization in γ‐InSe ensures that the tunneling device has a high photo responsivity of ≈255 A W−1 and a fast response time for real‐time imaging. The work not only provides insights into the multidirectional sliding ferroelectricity of rhombohedral‐stacked 2D materials but also highlights their potential for tunable photovoltaics and imaging applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel atomically dispersed catalyst (Co─Se/Co/NC) with the coexistence of Co single‐atom sites and Co─Se dual‐atom sites, exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability. The introduction of Se single atoms and the synergistic effect of Co single‐atom and Co─Se dual atom can modulate the d‐band center of metal sites and promote the desorption of *OH, thereby significantly accelerating the ORR process.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal (ADTM) catalysts are widely implemented in energy conversion reactions, while the similar properties of TMs make it difficult to continuously improve the activity of ADTMs via tuning the composition of metals. Introducing nonmetal sites into ADTMs may help to effectively modulate the electronic structure of metals and significantly improve the activity. However, it is difficult to achieve the co‐existence of ADTMs with nonmetal atoms and clarify their synergistic effect on the catalytic mechanism. Therefore, elucidating the active sites within atomically dispersed metal‐nonmetal materials and unveiling catalytic mechanism is highly important. Herein, a novel hybrid catalyst, with coexistence of Co single‐atoms and Co─Se dual‐atom sites (Co─Se/Co/NC), is successfully synthesized and exhibits remarkable performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Theoretical results demonstrate that the Se sites can effectively modulate the charge redistribution at Co active sites. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between Co single‐atom sites and Co─Se dual‐atom sites can further adjust the d‐band center, optimize the adsorption/desorption behavior of intermediates, and finally accelerate the ORR kinetics. This work has clearly clarified the reaction mechanism and shows the great potential of atomically dispersed metal‐nonmetal nanomaterials for energy conversion and storage applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Developing sufficiently effective bifunctional electrodes for low‐voltage hydrogen production at industrial‐grade current density is highly significant but challenging. This work innovatively engineers high‐entropy alloy nanoflower array electrodes with abundant high‐activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways, and achieves unprecedented performance for two‐electrode hydrazine oxidation‐assisted hydrogen production at industrial‐grade current densities.








Abstract
Developing sufficiently effective non‐precious metal catalysts for large‐current‐density hydrogen production is highly significant but challenging, especially in low‐voltage hydrogen production systems. Here, we innovatively report high‐entropy alloy nanoflower array (HEANFA) electrodes with optimizable reaction pathways for hydrazine oxidation‐assisted hydrogen production at industrial‐grade current densities. Atomic‐resolution structural analyses confirm the single‐phase solid‐solution structure of HEANFA. The HEANFA electrodes exhibit the top‐level electrocatalytic performance for both the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Furthermore, the hydrazine oxidation‐assisted splitting (OHzS) system assembled with HEANFA as both anode and cathode exhibits a record‐breaking performance for hydrogen production. It achieves ultralow working voltages of 0.003, 0.081, 0.260, 0.376, and 0.646 V for current densities of 10, 100, 500, 1 000, and 2 000 mA cm−2, respectively, and remarkable stability for 300 h, significantly outperforming those of previously reported OHzS systems and other chemicals‐assisted hydrogen production systems. Theoretical calculations reveal that extraordinary performance of HEANFA for OHzS is attributed to its abundant high‐activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways in HER and HzOR. In particular, HEANFA enables intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby optimizing the reaction pathways and creating high‐activity sites, ultimately endowing the extraordinary performance for OHzS.

<title>Na+‐Complexed Dendritic Polyglycerols for Recovery of Frozen Cells and Their Network in Media</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cryoprotectants in biological buffer systems often struggle due to the presence of abundant salts. A precise topological control of polyglycerols provides unique retention‐and‐release of sodium ions, which activates the formation of hydrogen bonding with ice interfaces. This interaction allows the polymer to inhibit ice growths both in intra‐ and extracellular spaces, resulting in successful post‐thaw cell survival and network‐forming functionality.








Abstract
In this study, a novel phenomenon is identified where precise control of topology and generation of polyglycerol induce the retention of Na+ ions in biological buffer systems, effectively inhibiting ice crystal growth during cryopreservation. Unlike linear and hyperbranched counterparts, densely‐packed hydroxyl and ether groups in 4th‐generation dendritic polyglycerol interact with the ions, activating the formation of hydrogen bonding at the ice interface. By inhibiting both intra‐ and extracellular ice growth and recrystallization, this biocompatible dendritic polyglycerol proves highly effective as a cryoprotectant; hence, achieving the cell recovery rates of ≈134–147%, relative to those of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, which is a conventional cryoprotectant for human tongue squamous carcinoma (HSC‐3) cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells. Further, it successfully recovers the network‐forming capabilities of HUVEC cells to ≈89% in tube formation after thawing. The Na+ ion retention‐driven ice‐growth inhibition activity in biological media highlights the unique properties of dendritic polyglycerol and introduces a new topological concept for cell‐cryoprotectant development.

A bicontinuous mesoporous carbon nanofiber and carbon nanosheet network is developed to enable high site utilization of single‐atom Ni and interfacial CO2 enrichment. The in situ dynamic transformation of the planar Ni−N4 to an out‐of‐plane configuration is revealed, showing enhanced intrinsic electrokinetics for CO2 reduction. The integrated merits of network support and in situ tailored low‐valance‐state Ni site endow outstanding performance in acidic CO2‐to‐CO electrolysis.








Abstract
Carbon‐supported single‐atom catalysts exhibit exceptional properties in acidic CO2 reduction. However, traditional carbon supports fall short in building high‐site‐utilization and CO2‐rich interfacial environments, and the structural evolution of single‐atom metals and catalytic mechanisms under realistic conditions remain ambiguous. Herein, an interconnected mesoporous carbon nanofiber and carbon nanosheet network (IPCF@CS) is reported, derived from microphase‐separated block copolymer, to improve catalytic efficiency of isolated Ni. In IPCF@CS nanostructure, highly mesoporous IPCF hinders stacking of CS that provides additional fully exposed sites and abundant bicontinuous mesochannels of IPCF facilitate smooth CO2 transport. Such unique features enable enhanced Ni utilization and local CO2 enrichment, which cannot be achieved over conventional pore‐deficient and discontinuous porous carbon fibers‐based supports. In situ X‐ray and Infrared spectroscopy coupling constant‐potential calculations reveal the dynamic distortion of the planar Ni−N4 to an out‐of‐plane configuration with expanded Ni−N bond during operating CO2 electroreduction. The potential‐driven low‐valance‐state Ni−N4 possesses enhanced intrinsic electrokinetics for CO2 activation and CO desorption yet inhibiting hydrogen evolution. The favorable electronic and interfacial reaction environments, resulted from the in situ tailored Ni site and IPCF@CS support, achieve an FE of near 100% at 540 mA cm−2, a TOF of 55.5 s−1, and a SPCE of 89.2% in acidic CO2‐to‐CO electrolysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work proposes a universal synthesis method for rare‐earth single‐atom catalysts with Cl axially coordination for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which exhibits excellent ORR activity and successful applications in zinc‐air batteries. The strong d‐p orbital coupling between La and Cl significantly improves the electronic structure of the La site, ensuring efficient activation of O2 and suitable adsorption of *OH.








Abstract
Currently, there are still obstacles to rationally designing the ligand fields to activate rare‐earth (RE) elements with satisfactory intrinsic electrocatalytic reactivity. Herein, axial coordination strategies and nanostructure design are applied for the construction of La single atoms (La‐Cl SAs/NHPC) with satisfactory oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The nontrivial LaN4Cl2 motifs configuration and the hierarchical porous carbon substrate that facilitates maximized metal atom utilization ensure high half‐wave potential (0.91 V) and significant robustness in alkaline media. The aqueous and flexible Zinc‐air battery (ZAB) integrating La‐Cl SAs/NHPC as the cathode catalyst exhibits a maximum power density of 260.7 and 68.5 mW cm−2, representing one of the most impressive RE‐based ORR electrocatalysts to date. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the Cl coordination evidently modulate the electronic structures of La sites, which promoted electron transfer efficiency by d‐p orbital couplings. With enhanced electroactivity of La sites, the adsorptions of key intermediates are optimized to alleviate the energy barriers of the potential‐determining step. Importantly, this preparation strategy is also successfully applied to other REs. This work provides perspectives for near‐range electronic structure modulation of RE‐SAs based on a nonplanar coordination micro‐environment for efficient electrocatalysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Zn1.2Ga1.6Ge0.2O4:Ni2+ nanophosphor with NIR II emission that is responsive to environmental stimuli including temperature and specific solvent variations has been successfully prepared. Leveraging the unique properties of ZGGO:Ni NIR II nanophosphors, an innovative environment‐interactive information encryption strategy with multiple dimensions, including wavelength, luminescence lifetime, and external stimuli like temperature and humidity has been developed to enhance information security.








Abstract
Inspired by the natural responsive phenomena, herein the multiple responsive persistent luminescent Zn1.2Ga1.6Ge0.2O4:Ni2+ (ZGGO:Ni) nanoparticles with near‐infrared  (NIR) II emission peak ≈1330 nm derived from the Ni2+ doping through controlled synthesis based on hydrothermal method are obtained. The obtained NIR II persistent luminescent ZGGO:Ni can not only respond to temperature but also the specific solvent stimulus. The results demonstrate that the NIR II persistent luminescence intensity decreases in hydroxyl containing solvent such as water (H2O) and ethyl alcohol (C2H6O), while the PL intensity remains in solvent without hydroxyl groups such as n‐hexane (C6H14) and deuterated water (D2O). This NIR II luminescence quenching is attributed to the adsorption of interaction hydroxyl groups in specific solvents with the amino group on the surface of ZGGO:Ni and the subsequent fluorescence resonance energy transfer mechanism. Benefiting from the multiple responsive properties, the obtained NIR II persistent luminescent ZGGO:Ni is utilized for high‐order dynamic optical information encryption, providing increased security level. The multi‐responsive NIR II persistent luminescence strategy outlined in this study is anticipated to offer a straightforward methodology for optimizing the optical characteristics of NIR II persistent luminescent materials. Moreover, it is set to expand the scope of their applications in the realm of dynamic and environment‐interactive information encryption, thereby opening frontiers for their utilization in advanced security measures.

Using in situ experimental techniques and theoretical calculations, the key C₃ intermediates are identified providing crucial insights into the CH₃CH₂COOH formation pathway.








Abstract
The direct photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into high‐value C3 chemicals holds great promise but remains challenging due to the intrinsic difficulty of C1–C1 and C2–C1 coupling processes and the lack of clarity regarding the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, the design and synthesis of a Cu‐ZnS photocatalyst featuring dispersed Cu single atoms are reported. These Cu single atoms are coordinated with S atoms, forming unique Cu‐S‐Zn active units with tunable charge distributions that interact favorably with surface‐adsorbed intermediates. This configuration stabilizes the *COHCO intermediate and facilitates its subsequent coupling with *CO to form *COCOHCO both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable on the Cu‐ZnS surface. Notably, multiple critical C3 intermediates, including *COCOHCO, *OCCCO, and *CHCHCO, are identified, providing a clear reaction pathway for CO2 to CH3CH2COOH conversion. The Cu‐ZnS photocatalyst achieves a CO2 to CH3CH2COOH conversion rate of 0.45 µmol h−¹ with an electron selectivity of 91.2%. Remarkably, in the presence of triethanolamine, the production rate increases to 16.9 µmol h−¹ with a selectivity of 99.8%. These findings underscore the importance of modulating multicarbon coupling processes to enable the efficient photocatalytic transformation of CO2 into C3 products, paving the way for future advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel category of high‐entropy metal oxides, functionalized by multiple metal interstitials, exhibits significant lattice distortion that inhibits metal leaching and enhances electron contribution for efficient catalytic oxidation.








Abstract
Substitution metal doping strategies are crucial for developing catalysts capable of activating O2, but the leaching of metal dopants has greatly hindered their potential for extensive oxidation reactions under mild conditions. Here, the study develops an entropy‐increase strategy to synthesize high‐entropy metal (Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, and Co) interstitial functionalized anatase TiO2 (HE‐TiO2) nanosheets, demonstrating remarkable degradation efficiency across a wide pH range and exceptional stability in a flow‐by electro‐catalytic reactor. Relative to that of pristine TiO2, the intense lattice distortion on the (001) plane, an average lattice expansion of 2% on the (100) plane, and decrease of second shell peak of X‐ray absorption spectra serve as compelling evidence for the formation of metal interstitials in HE‐TiO2. Theoretical analysis and in situ synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared studies reveal that the electron of metal interstitials can populate the subgap states within the host TiO2, enabling a moderate adsorption band for robust and efficient O2 activation. This study introduces a universal strategy for synthesizing a novel class of high‐entropy materials with integrated metal interstitials in metal oxides, promising to enhance the stability and efficiency of O2 activation catalysts and broaden their potential applications.

<title>A Universal Strategy to Mitigate Microphase Separation via Cellulose Nanocrystal Hydration in Fabricating Strong, Tough, and Fatigue‐Resistant Hydrogels</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A universal phase‐engineering strategy is reported to achieve mechanically robust hydrogels by tuning microphase separation using cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and common compatible polymer systems. CNC plays a crucial role in contributing to mitigating microphase separation for strengthening and toughening hydrogels. Benefiting from the CNC‐mitigated microphase separation structure, the enabling hydrogel exhibits unprecedented combinations in mechanical properties.








Abstract
As a common natural phenomenon, phase separation is exploited for the development of high‐performance hydrogels. Using supersaturated salt to create microphase‐separated hydrogels with strengthened mechanical properties has gained widespread attention. However, such strengthened hydrogel loses its intrinsic flexibility, making the phase separation strategy unsuitable for the fabrication of stretchable and tough hydrogels. Here, a phase‐engineering design strategy is introduced to produce stretchable yet tough hydrogels using supersaturated NaAc salt, by leveraging the hydration effect of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) to mitigate microphase separation. The CNC‐mitigated microphase‐separated hydrogel presents unprecedented mechanical properties, for example, tensile strength of 1.8 MPa with a fracture strain of 4730%, toughness of 43.1 MJ m−3, fracture energy of 75.4 kJ m−2, and fatigue threshold up to 3884.7 J m−2. Furthermore, this approach is universal in synthesizing various microphase separation‐enhanced polymer gels, including polyacrylic acid, poly(acrylic acid‐co‐acrylamide), gelatin, and alginate. These advancements provide insights into the incorporation of CNC‐mediated microphase separation structures in hydrogels, which will foster the future development of high‐performance soft materials.

<title>Bond Confinement‐Dependent Peierls Distortion in Epitaxially Grown Bismuth Films</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper investigates the influence of thickness on the properties of thin epitaxial Bi films. It discusses results from optical, vibrational, and structural analyses, highlighting notable changes in dielectric function, phonon frequencies, and Peierls distortion. The competition between electron localization and delocalization is emphasized, showing how thickness reduction can tailor material properties without changing stoichiometry.








Abstract
A systematic study of the impact of film thickness on the properties of thin Bi films is presented. To this end, epitaxial films of high quality have been grown on a Si (111) substrate with thicknesses ranging from 1.9 to 29.9 nm. Broadband optical spectroscopy reveals a notable decline in the optical dielectric constant and the absorption peak height as the film thickness decreases, alongside a shift of the absorption maximum to higher photon energies. Raman and pump‐probe spectroscopy show that the phonon mode frequencies increase upon decreasing film thickness, with the in‐plane mode frequency rising by 10% from the thickest to the thinnest sample. The X‐ray diffraction analysis reveals an increasing Peierls distortion for thinner films, explaining the observed property changes. Quantum chemical bonding analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the properties of thin bismuth are influenced by the interplay between electron localization and delocalization, characteristic of metavalently bonded solids. This study shows that for solids that utilize metavalent bonding, a thickness reduction leads to significant property changes. The effect can even be employed to tailor material properties without the need to change material stoichiometry.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Machine learning has been successfully employed to optimize the compositions of multicomponent electrolytes. As a result, the as‐obtained novel Zn‐air batteries can deliver superior battery reversibility and stability (1700 h at 2 mA cm−2 and 1400 h at 20 mA cm−2), and greatly improved round‐trip efficiency as high as 76.3%.








Abstract
Aqueous alkaline Zn‐air batteries (ZABs) have garnered widespread attention due to their high energy density and safety, however, the poor electrochemical reversibility of Zn and low battery round‐trip efficiency strongly limit their further development. The manipulation of an intricate microscopic balance among anode/electrolyte/cathode, to enhance the performance of ZABs, critically relies on the formula of electrolytes. Herein, the Bayesian optimization approach is employed to achieve the effective design of optimal compositions of multicomponent electrolytes, resulting in the remarkable enhancement of ZAB performance. Notably, ethylene glycol has been successfully employed as both electrolyte additive and fuel, playing key roles in changing the reaction pathways of ZABs, especially the storage form of discharge products from ZnO deposition on the anode to Zn2+‐based hybrid particle colloids in the electrolyte. As a result, the as‐obtained novel ZABs can deliver superior battery reversibility and stability (1700 h at 2 mA cm−2 and 1400 h at 20 mA cm−2), greatly improved round‐trip efficiency as high as 76.3%, and even continuous discharge until complete Zn anode depletion. This work has demonstrated enormous potential for long‐term energy storage applications and holds promise for bringing new opportunities to the development of ZABs.

<title>Ultra‐Stiff yet Super‐Elastic Graphene Aerogels by Topological Cellular Hierarchy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ultra‐stiff yet super‐elastic aerogel is realized through the design of a topological cellular hierarchy, enabling it to support high loads through preferably reversible buckling deformation, thereby overcoming the intrinsic conflict between high stiffness and superior recoverability.








Abstract
Lightweight cellular materials with high stiffness and excellent recoverability are critically important in structural engineering applications, but the intrinsic conflict between these two properties presents a significant challenge. Here, a topological cellular hierarchy is presented, designed to fabricate ultra‐stiff (>10 MPa modulus) yet super‐elastic (>90% recoverable strain) graphene aerogels. This topological cellular hierarchy, composed of massive corrugated pores and nanowalls, is designed to carry high loads through predominantly reversible buckling within the honeycomb framework. The compressive modulus of the as‐prepared graphene aerogel is nearly twice that of conventional graphene aerogel. This high‐stiff graphene aerogel also exhibits exceptional mechanical recoverability, achieving up to 60% strain recovery over 10 000 fatigue cycles without significant structural failure, outperforming most previously reported porous lattices and monoliths. It is further demonstrated that this graphene aerogel exhibits superior energy dissipation and anti‐fatigue dynamic impact properties, with an energy absorption capacity nearly an order of magnitude greater than that of conventional aerogels. These exceptional properties of the topological cellular graphene aerogel open new avenues for high‐energy bullet protection, offering great promise for the development of lightweight, armor‐like protective materials in transportation and aerospace applications.

<title>Concurrent Pressure‐Induced Superconductivity and Photoconductivity Transitions in PbSe0.5Te0.5</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Concurrent superconductivity and negative photoconductivity (NPC) are discovered in PbSe0.5Te0.5 accompanying pressure‐induced phase transitions. Both have a strong structure dependence and are jointly mediated by electron‐phonon interplay, which is switchable via illumination or cooling at high‐pressure. New findings offer more new insights into understanding the essence of photoelectric‐lattice coupling and developing versatile materials of lead chalcogenides.








Abstract
Concurrent superconductivity and negative photoconductivity (NPC) are rarely observed. Here, the discovery in PbSe0.5Te0.5 of superconductivity and photoconductivity transitions between positive photoconductivity (PPC) and NPC during compression is reported to ≈40 GPa and subsequent decompression, which are also accompanied by reversible structure transitions (3D Fm3¯${{\bar{3}}}$m ⇌ 2D Pnma ⇌ 3D Pm3¯${{\bar{3}}}$m). Superconductivity with a maximum Tc of ≈6.7 K coincides with NPC and structure transition of Pnma to Pm3¯${{\bar{3}}}$m at ≈18 GPa and the latter phase is preserved down to ≈5 GPa with enhanced Tc of ≈6.9 K during decompression. The observations imply the simultaneous superconducting and photoconductive transitions are closely related to the metallic Pm3¯${{\bar{3}}}$m phase. First‐principles calculations suggest the enhanced p‐p hybridization and charge transfer between Pb‐5p and ligand‐p orbitals near the Fermi surface play key roles in electron‐phonon interaction of mediating the Cooper pairs in PbSe0.5Te0.5. Hall coefficient measurements reveal that photothermal effect enhances electron‐phonon interplay, which decreases carrier concentration and mobility and results in the reversal of PPC‐NPC. Structure‐dependent superconductivity and NPC are jointly mediated by electron‐phonon interplay, which is tunable through illumination or cooling at high‐pressure. The findings shed light on the origin of superconductive and photoconductive transitions in versatile materials of lead chalcogenides.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A “smart” n‐type conjugated polymer with glycolated side chains that forms a more ordered assembly when electrochemically doped, is reported along with a newly synthesized p‐type conjugated polymer. The n‐type and p‐type polymers complement each other perfectly to construct an organic complementary inverter, achieving a record voltage gain of 307 VV−1.








Abstract
The charge transport of channel materials in n‐type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is greatly limited by the adverse effects of electrochemical doping, posing a long‐standing puzzle for the community. Herein, an n‐type conjugated polymer with glycolated side chains (n‐PT3) is introduced. This polymer can adapt to electrochemical doping and create more organized nanostructures, mitigating the adverse effects of electrochemical doping. This unique characteristic gives n‐PT3 excellent charge transport in the doped state and reversible ion storage, making it highly suitable as an n‐type organic mixed ionic‐electronic conducting (OMIEC) material. n‐PT3 exhibits a high electron mobility of µ ≈ 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a figure of merit value of µC* ≈ 100 F cm−1 V−1 s−1, representing one of the best results for n‐type OMIEC materials. A new p‐type OMIEC polymer has been synthesized as the channel material for constructing a complementary inverter to match the n‐type OECT channel layer based on n‐PT3. As a result, a voltage gain value of up to 307 VV−1 has been achieved, which is a record value for sub−1 V complementary inverters based on OECTs. This work offers valuable insights into designing electrochemical doping adaptive n‐type OMIEC materials and fabricating high‐gain organic complementary inverters.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A class of metasurfaces capable of multiplexing guided and space waves is proposed to achieve advanced EM functionalities in microwave regions, which can find great application potentials in radar systems, wireless communications, and wireless power transfer. The findings significantly expand the capabilities of metasurfaces in manipulating EM waves and stimulate advanced multifunctional meta devices facing more challenging and diversified application demands.








Abstract
Nowadays, metasurfaces have attracted considerable attention due to their promising and advanced control of electromagnetic (EM) waves. However, it is still challenging to shape guided waves into desired free‐space mode, while simultaneously manipulating spatial incident waves using a single metasurface. Herein, a class of metasurfaces capable of multiplexing guided and space waves is proposed to achieve advanced EM functionalities in microwave regions, which can find great application potentials in radar systems, wireless communications, and wireless power transfer (WPT). The proposed metasurface, composed of specially designed meta‐atoms with polarization‐dependent radiation and reflection properties, provides the capability to fully manipulate complex amplitude of guided waves and reflection phase of space incident wave independently and simultaneously, thus enabling arbitrary radiation and reflection functionalities without encountering crosstalk issues. As examples of potential applications, three advanced EM functionalities operating in both far‐field and near‐field regions are presented: low‐sidelobe microwave antenna with reduced radar cross section (RCS), multifunctional WPT, and feed multiplexed holograms, respectively. The far‐field characteristics of the low sidelobe level antennas showing radiated beams at ± 30° together with RCS reduction under arbitrarily polarized incidences are validated by both simulations and measurements. A good agreement between experiments and simulations is also observed for the near‐field intensity distribution of the hologram, which further validates the feasibility of near‐field shaping. The findings significantly expand the capabilities of metasurfaces in manipulating EM waves and stimulate advanced multifunctional metadevices facing more challenging and diversified application demands.

This work develops a platform that combines tumor‐targeted antibody production with laser‐sensitive release system for enhanced immunotherapy. Utilizing pH‐responsive properties of platform for tumor targeting and laser irradiation to trigger the release of anti‐PD‐L1 antibodies and immunogenic cell death. This stimulates dendritic cell maturation and T cell infiltration, significantly enhancing anti‐tumor activity, and offering a potent approach to cancer treatment.








Abstract
Immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, has revolutionized oncology. However, it encounters challenges such as inadequate drug accumulation and limited efficacy against “cold” tumors characterized by lack of T cell infiltration and immunosuppressive microenvironments. Here, a controlled antibody production and releasing nanoparticle (CAPRN) is introduced, designed to augment ICB efficacy by facilitating tumor‐targeted antibody production and inducing photodynamic cell death. CAPRN achieves tumor‐specific accumulation via pH‐responsive PEG detachment, enabling efficient intracellular gene delivery encoding anti‐PD‐L1 antibody. Laser‐induced photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only triggers cancer cell death but also facilitates targeted antibody release from dying tumor cells. CAPRN demonstrates significant anti‐tumor efficacy, attributed to multiple effects including enhanced antibody release, dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and T cell activation. Moreover, CAPRN exhibits substantial tumor suppression in both primary and bilateral tumor models, accompanied by activated T cell infiltration and enhanced immune responses. This study presents a novel strategy for priming robust immunotherapy, offering targeted antibody release through laser‐assisted photodynamic nanoparticles.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Structural evolution of (Ta, Ti, Cr, Nb)C high‐entropy carbide nanoparticles during oxidation is tracked in situ by using an environmental aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Three key oxidation stages are discerned at the atomic level: i) increased amorphization (300–500 °C); ii) nucleation and subsequent growth of locally ordered oxide nanoclusters (500–800 °C); and iii) final one‐step crystallization of high‐entropy oxides.








Abstract
Understanding the behavior of high‐entropy carbides (HECs) under oxygen‐containing environments is of particular importance for their promising applications in structural components, catalysis, and energy‐related fields. Herein, the structural evolution of (Ta, Ti, Cr, Nb)C (HEC‐1) nanoparticles (NPs) is tracked in situ during the oxidation at the atomic scale by using an open‐cell environmental aberration‐corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Three key stages are clearly discerned during the oxidation of HEC‐1 NPs at the atomic level below 900 °C: i) increased amorphization of HEC‐1 NPs from 300 to 500 °C due to the energetically favorable formation of carbon vacancies and substitution of carbon with oxygen atoms; ii) nucleation and subsequent growth of locally ordered nanocluster intermediates within the generated amorphous oxides from 500 to 800 °C; and iii) final one‐step crystallization of non‐equimolar MeO2 and Me2O5 (Me = metallic elements, Ta, Ti, Cr, and Nb) high‐entropy oxides above 800 °C, accompanied with the reduction in atomic defects. This result is further confirmed by theoretical calculations that these observed high‐entropy oxide phases are thermodynamically preferable to generate above 830 °C. The study provides direct evidence of the ordered–disordered–ordered structural transition of HECs during oxidation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The charge transfer resistance of Li–S using the modified separator is reduced. In addition, there is no corrosion and the lithium anode is dendrite‐free. The ‘shuttle effect’ of polysulfides is greatly suppressed.








Abstract
The “shuttle effect” and the unchecked growth of lithium dendrites during operation in lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries seriously impact their practical applications. Besides, the performances of Li–S batteries at high current densities and sulfur loadings hold the key to bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical applications. To address the above issues and facilitate the practical utilization of Li–S batteries, the commercial separator is modified with solid electrolyte (nanorod LiAlO2, LAO) and conductive carbon (Super P) to obtain a double coated separator (SPLAOMS). The SPLAOMS can physically barrier polysulfides and accelerate reaction kinetics. In addition, it enhances uniform lithium deposition, boosts ionic conductivity, and increases the utilization of active sulfur substances. The prepared Li–S batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability under harsh conditions (high sulfur loadings and high current densities) with an initial capacity of 733 mAh g−1 and a capacity attenuation of 0.03% per cycle at 5C in 500 cycle life. Under ultra‐high sulfur loading (8.2 mg cm−2), the prepared battery maintains a satisfactory capacity of 800 mAh g−1 during cycling, demonstrating enormous commercial application potential. This study serves as a pivotal reference for the commercialization of high‐performance Li–S batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultra‐thin, layered single crystal films of molecular semiconductor 2,9‐dioctylnaphtho[2,3‐b]naphtha[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3‐d]thiophene (C8‐DNTT‐C8) are studied using conductive atomic force microscopy (C‐AFM), revealing changes in out‐of‐plane electrical current as a function of the number of molecular layers. A vertical transfer length method is devised, which enables to estimate the out‐of‐plane charge transport properties of an organic semiconductor at an unprecedented molecular length scale.








Abstract
High contact resistance remains the primary obstacle that hinders further advancements of organic semiconductors (OSCs) in electronic circuits. While significant effort has been directed toward lowering the energy barrier at OSC/metal contact interfaces, approaches toward reducing another major contributor to overall contact resistance – the bulk resistance – have been limited to minimizing the thickness of OSC films. However, the out‐of‐plane conductivity of OSCs, a critical aspect of bulk resistance, has largely remained unaddressed. In this study, multi‐layered 2D crystalline, solution‐processed films of the high‐mobility molecular semiconductor 2,9‐dioctylnaphtho[2,3‐b] naphtha[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[2,3‐d]thiophene (C8‐DNTT‐C8) are investigated using conductive‐probe atomic force microscopy (C‐AFM) to evaluate out‐of‐plane charge transport. The findings reveal a linear increase in out‐of‐plane resistance with the number of molecular layers in the film, which is modeled using an equivalent circuit model with multiple tunneling barriers connected in series. Building upon these results, a vertical transfer length method (V‐TLM) is developed, allowing one to determine the out‐of‐plane resistivity of OSC and providing insights into charge transport properties at a single molecule length scale. The V‐TLM approach highlights the potential of C‐AFM for investigating out‐of‐plane charge transport in OSC thin films and holds promise for accelerating the screening of molecules for high‐performance electronic devices.

<title>Stabilizing the Fe Species of Nickel‐Iron Double Hydroxide via Chelating Asymmetric Aldehyde‐Containing THB Ligand for Long‐Lasting Water Oxidation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The stabilization of Fe species is achieved through the chelation of asymmetric aldehyde‐containing ligand THB, which enhances OER performance of NiFeOOH/THB in long‐lasting overall water splitting by suppressing the dissolution of Fe and facilitating the rapid formation of highly valent active Fe (III) species.








Abstract
Nickel‐iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are considered as promising substitutes for precious metals in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, most of the reported NiFe LDHs suffer from poor long‐term stability because of the Fe loss during OER resulting in severe inactivation. Herein, a dynamically stable chelating interface through in situ transformation of asymmetric aldehyde‐ligand (THB, 1,3,5‐Tris(3′‐hydroxy‐4′‐formylphenyl)‐benzene) modified NiFe LDHs to anchor Fe and significantly enhance the OER stability is reported. The fabricated asymmetric aldehyde‐containing ligand THB is capable of stimulating much more interfacial charge transfer from NiFe LDHs to the oxygen group of THB and accelerating the formation of highly valent active Fe species leading to the strong combination between Fe and ligand and the reduced activation energy barrier of the intermediate, respectively. The optimized aldehyde‐ligand‐chelated NiFe LDHs (NiFe LDH/THB) shows enhanced OER performance featuring an overpotential of 224 mV at 100 mA cm−2 and robust stability for over 3860 h at 100 mA cm−2 in a water splitting device maintaining a cell voltage of only 1.68 V, which paves a new avenue to improve the water electrolysis performance of non‐noble metal catalysts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The selectivity of the sensing material can be expressed through the idiosyncratic behavior of the gas sensing process, meanwhile, the identification of the target gas becomes more accurate.








Abstract
Traditional selectivity of gas sensors determined by the magnitude of the response value has significant limitations. The distinctive inversion sensing behavior not only defies the traditional sensing theory but also provides insight into defining selectivity. Herein, the novel definition of selectivity is established in a study with VO2(M1). The sensing behavior of VO2(M1) is investigated after its synthesis conditions optimization by machine learning. In gases of the same nature, VO2(M1) shows remarkably selective for NH3 marked with unique resistance increase behavior. Such anomalous behavior is attributed to the formation of the Schottky junction between VO2(M1) and the electrode. The “work function‐electron affinity” relation is summarized as the selectivity coefficient, a parameter for predicting the selectivity of the sensing material effectively.

For the first time, a suite of advanced surface‐to‐bulk operando characterizations and systematic computations are combined to successfully establish a link between oxygen‐evolving performance and operational spatiotemporal behaviors on model‐coordinated oxides during electrochemical oxidation. The underlying catalysis mechanism and activity‐stability trade‐off are further revealed and solved in electrode and device.








Abstract
Tetrahedral, pyramidal, and octahedral metal‐oxygen coordinated ligands are fundamental components in all metal‐oxide structures. Understanding the impacts of their spatiotemporal behaviors during electrochemical oxidation is crucial for diverse applications, yet remains unsolved due to challenges in designing model oxides and conducting operando characterizations. Herein, combining a suite of advanced operando characterizations and systematic computations, a link between oxygen‐evolving performance and operational structural properties is established on model oxides. Compared with tetrahedral and octahedral structures, pyramidal structure is more susceptible to OH− attack due to its pristine unsaturated and asymmetric features and constant single‐electron occupancy on the active z2 orbital during reaction, leading to surface‐to‐bulk restructuration into active amorphous high‐valence CoOOHx with edge‐sharing configurations. This is accompanied by ion leaching to create nanoscale space, following a leaching tendency of Sr2+ > Ba2+ > La3+ > Y3+. Operando soft X‐ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates a harder non‐uniform dehydrogenation process over time (Co3+OOH → Co3+/4+OOHx → Co4+OO) because of the enhanced CoO covalency with higher energy barriers. Lattice oxygen participates in active CoOOHx formation but sacrifices stability. To address this activity‐stability trade‐off, an ion‐tuning strategy is proposed to simultaneously enhance both activity and stability in electrode and device.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The precise bromination of the quinoxaline‐fused core affords two isomeric nonfullerene acceptors, contributing to improved electronic and aggregation structures. AQx‐22‐based devices exhibit a superior PCE of 19.5% with a high open‐circuit voltage of 0.97 V and the lowest energy loss of 0.476 eV reported to date for binary OSCs. Such an isomerization strategy shows great promise for developing next‐generation high‐performance OSCs.








Abstract
Highly efficient nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs) with low energy loss (Eloss) and favorable morphology are critical for breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving commercial applications of OSCs. In this work, quinoxaline‐based NFAs are designed and synthesized using a synergistic isomerization and bromination approach. The π‐expanded quinoxaline‐fused core exhibits different bromination sites for isomeric NFAs, namely AQx‐21 and AQx‐22. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that the isomerization effect of core bromination significantly influences molecular intrinsic properties, including electrostatic potentials, polarizability, dielectric constant, exciton binding energy, crystallinity, and miscibility with donor materials, thereby improving molecular packing and bulk‐heterojunction morphology. Consequently, the AQx‐22‐based blend exhibits enhanced crystallinity, reduced domain size, and optimized phase distribution, which facilitates charge transport, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. The AQx‐22‐treated OSCs obtain an impressive efficiency of 19.5% with a remarkable open‐circuit voltage of 0.970 V and a low Eloss of 0.476 eV. This study provides deep insights into NFA design and elucidates the potential working mechanisms for optimizing morphology and device performance through isomerization engineering of core bromination, highlighting its significance in advancing OSC technology.

<title>Decoupling the Effects of Interface Chemical Degradation and Mechanical Cracking in Solid‐State Batteries with Silicon Electrode</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Silicon's high capacity and dendrite suppression potential make it a promising negative electrode in solid‐state batteries (SSBs), yet cycling stability remains an issue. This study reveals that mechanical cracking, rather than chemical degradation, drives increased resistance in Si/Li6PS5Cl electrodes. Small‐grained Li6PS5Cl improves microstructural stability, reducing cracks and enhancing cycling performance, providing insights for better silicon‐based SSBs.








Abstract
Silicon is a promising negative electrode material for solid‐state batteries (SSBs) due to its high specific capacity and ability to prevent lithium dendrite formation. However, SSBs with silicon electrodes currently suffer from poor cycling stability, despite chemical engineering efforts. This study investigates the cycling failure mechanism of composite Si/Li6PS5Cl electrodes by decoupling the effects of interface chemical degradation and mechanical cracking. Chlorine‐rich Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 suppresses interface chemical degradation when paired with silicon, while small‐grained Li6PS5Cl shows 4.3‐fold increase of interface resistance due to large Si/Li6PS5Cl contact area for interface degradation. Despite this, small‐grained Li6PS5Cl improves the microstructure homogeneity of the electrode composites, effectively alleviating the stress accumulation caused by the expansion/shrinkage of silicon particles. This minimizes bulk cracks in Li6PS5Cl during the lithiation processes and interface delamination during the delithiation processes. Mechanical cracking shows a dominant role in increasing interface resistance than interface chemical degradation. Therefore, electrodes with small‐grained Li6PS5Cl show better cycling stability than those with Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5. This work not only provides an approach to decouple the complex effects for cycling failure analysis but also provides a guideline for better use of silicon in negative electrodes of SSBs.

<title>Interface Storage Mechanism in Aqueous Ammonium‐Ion Supercapacitors with Keggin‐Type Polyoxometalates‐Modified Ag‐BTC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
{PMo12} and {PW12}, which possess many metal‐Ox active sites, have been used as aqueous ammonium‐ion supercapacitor materials to achieve extremely high‐activity charge storage through a surface‐interface energy storage mechanism. Supercapacitor devices assembles with the same energy storage mechanism but different redox potential electrode materials for the positive and negative electrodes can attain ultrahigh energy density and effectively enhance stability.








Abstract
Ammonium‐ion supercapacitors (AISCs) offer considerable potential for future development owing to their low cost, high safety, environmental sustainability, and efficient electrochemical energy storage capabilities. The rapid and efficient charge‐transfer process at the AISC can endow them with high capacitive and cycling stabilities. However, the prolonged intercalation/deintercalation of NH4+ in layered and framework materials often results in the cleavage of the active sites and the deconstruction of the framework, which makes it difficult to achieve long‐term stable energy storage while maintaining high capacitance in the electrode materials. Herein, highly redox‐active polyoxometalates (POMs) modified [Ag3(µ‐Hbtc)(µ‐H2btc)]n (Ag‐BTC) is used as electrode materials. POMs effectively promote the pseudocapacitance storage of NH4+ through a similar interface storage mechanism. At a current density of 1 A g−1, {PMo12}@Ag‐BTC exhibited a specific capacitance of 619.4 mAh g−1 and retained 100% of its capacitance after 20,000 charge–discharge cycles. An asymmetrical battery with {PMo12}@Ag‐BTC and {PW12}@Ag‐BTC as positive and negative electrode materials, respectively, achieved an energy density of 125.3 Wh kg−1. The interface‐capacitance process enables the full utilization of metal‐Ox (x = b, c, t) sites within the POMs, significantly enhancing charge storage. This study emphasizes the considerable potential of POM‐based electrode materials for NH4+ intercalation/deintercalation energy storage.

<title>Highly Efficient Monolithic Perovskite/TOPCon Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by “Halide Locking”</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper reported a “Halide Locking” strategy to balance the crystalline rate of iodide and bromide anions on the rough silicon substrates, inducing the formation of homogenous and oriented perovskite crystal structure. The single‐junction devices yield the highest VOC of 1.277 V, and monolithic perovskite/TOPCon silicon tandem devices enable the record efficiency of 31.32% with improved light stability.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) are promising candidates for commercialization due to their outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, controlling the crystallization process and alleviating the phases/composition inhomogeneity represent a considerable challenge for perovskite layers grown on rough silicon substrates, ultimately limiting the efficiency and stability of TSC. Here, this study reports a “halide locking” strategy that simultaneously modulates the nucleation and crystal growth process of wide bandgap perovskites by introducing a multifunctional ammonium salt, thioacetylacetamide hydrochloride (TAACl), to bind with all types of cations and anions in the mixed halide perovskite precursor. The approach not only enables excellent compositional uniformity in the wet‐film stage but also induces preferred orientation along the (001) plane following nucleation, leading to enhanced homogeneity of the perovskite film in both vertical and horizontal directions over long‐length scales. The resulting wide‐bandgap perovskite solar cells yield exceptional open‐circuit voltage‐fill factor products (VOC × FF) of 1.074 and 1.040 in small‐ (0.0414 cm2) and large‐area (1.0208 cm2) devices, respectively. Corresponding large‐area tandem solar cells based on the Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) silicon subcells achieve a record PCE of 31.32% with a remarkable VOC of 1.931 V and FF of 81.54%.

<title>Coherent‐Precipitation‐Stabilized Phase Formation in Over‐Stoichiometric Rocksalt‐Type Li Superionic Conductors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The phase formation mechanisms of the over‐stoichiometric rocksalt‐type Li superionic conductor are systematically investigated. The spinel‐like phase with unconventional stoichiometry forms as coherent precipitate from the cation‐disordered rocksalt phase upon fast cooling, preventing decomposition into equilibrium phases and kinetically trapping the metastable face‐sharing configurations. The ionic conductivity is further optimized to 1.45 mS cm−1 at room temperature through low‐temperature post‐annealing.








Abstract
Rationalizing synthetic pathways is crucial for material design and property optimization, especially for polymorphic and metastable phases. Over‐stoichiometric rocksalt (ORX) compounds, characterized by their face‐sharing configurations, are a promising group of materials with unique properties; however, their development is significantly hindered by challenges in synthesizability. Here, taking the recently identified Li superionic conductor, over‐stoichiometric rocksalt Li–In–Sn–O (o‐LISO) material as a prototypical ORX compound, the mechanisms of phase formation are systematically investigated. It is revealed that the spinel‐like phase with unconventional stoichiometry forms as coherent precipitate from the high‐temperature‐stabilized cation‐disordered rocksalt phase upon fast cooling. This process prevents direct phase decomposition and kinetically locks the system in a metastable state with the desired face‐sharing Li configurations. This insight enables us to enhance the ionic conductivity of o‐LISO to be >1 mS cm−1 at room temperature through low‐temperature post‐annealing. This work offers insights into the synthesis of ORX materials and highlights important opportunities in this new class of materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Re‐designing the metal source to eliminate cluster‐missing defects and then adding extra ligands to heal the linker‐missing defects realize the construction of angstrom‐scale defect‐free MOF membranes. The MOF membrane with intrinsic angstrom‐sized lattice aperture shows an outstanding molecular sieving performance toward organic azeotropic mixtures, surpassing the upper‐bound of state‐of‐the‐art membranes.








Abstract
Crystalline membranes, represented by the metal‐organic framework (MOF) with well‐defined angstrom‐sized apertures, have shown great potential for molecular separation. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to separate small molecules with very similar molecular size differences due to angstrom‐scale defects during membrane formation. Herein, a stepwise assembling strategy is reported for constructing MOF membranes with intrinsic angstrom‐sized lattice aperture lattice to separate organic azeotropic mixtures separation. The membrane is synthesized by redesigning the metal source, which reduces the coordination reaction rate to avoid cluster‐missing defects. Then, extra ligands are introduced to overcome the coordination steric hindrance to heal the linker‐missing defects. Ultralow‐dose transmission electron microscopy is used to realize a direct observation of the angstrom‐scale defects. For separating the challenging methanol‐containing ester or ether azeotropic mixtures with molecular size difference as small as <1 Å, the angstrom‐scale defect‐free MOF membrane exhibits an outstanding flux of ≈3700 g·m−2 h−1 and separation factor of ≈247–524, far beyond the upper‐bound of state‐of‐the‐arts membranes. This study offers a feasible strategy for precisely constructing angstrom‐confined spaces for diverse applications (e.g., separation, catalysis, and storage).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work constructs a wavelength‐dependent, bipolarity‐modulated self‐powered ultra‐wide Bi2Se3/AlInAsSb heterojunction photodetector (PD) with a response range of 250–1900 nm, achieving a detectivity greater than 1010 Jones across the entire spectrum under zero bias. It also enables high‐contrast broad‐spectrum imaging and high‐encryption optical communication.








Abstract
Broadband photodetectors (PDs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to detect optical signals across a wide wavelength range, with applications spanning military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. However, existing broadband detectors face several practical challenges, including limited detection range, uneven photoresponse, and difficult to distinguish multispectral signals. To address these limitations, this study presents a self‐powered ultra‐wide PD based on the Bi2Se3/AlInAsSb heterojunction. The device can detect signals across a wide wavelength range from 250 nm to 1900 nm, exhibiting outstanding optoelectronic performance with a maximum responsivity of 0.5 A W−1, a detectivity of 4.2 × 1012 Jones, a switching ratio of 1.1 × 104, and an external quantum efficiency of 71.4%. Furthermore, the detector achieves a detectivity greater than 1010 Jones across the entire broadband range, significantly improving photoresponse uniformity. Notably, due to the differential band alignment of the two materials across spectral ranges, this detector exhibits a photocurrent polarity reversal in the 650–680 nm range. Leveraging its broadband and bipolar characteristics, this PD successfully enables secure information encryption in communication systems. This study significantly advances broadband PD technology, enhancing its practical uses and introducing innovative solutions for secure communications, thus strengthening communication security and confidentiality.

Abstract
By manipulating their asymmetric electronic spin states, the unique electronic structures and unsaturated coordination environments of single atoms can be effectively harnessed to control their magnetic properties. In this research, the first investigation is presented into the regulation of magnetic properties through the electronic spin states of single atoms. Magnetic single‐atom one‐dimensional materials, M‐N‐C/ZrO2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni), with varying electronic spin states, are design and synthesize based on the electronic orbital structure model. The SAs 3d electron spin structure of the composite M‐N‐C modulates the magneto physical properties and triggers a unique natural resonance loss, which achieves a controllable tuning of the effective absorption band under low‐frequency conditions. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of M‐N‐C can reach ‐69.71 dB, and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) ratio is as high as 91% (2–18 GHz). The current work provides a path toward achieving controllable modulation of low‐frequency electromagnetic wave bands by exploring the mechanism through which atomic and even electronic level interactions influence magnetic modulation.

This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of three distinct photothermal mechanisms. It discusses recent advancements in photothermal de‐icing and elucidates key challenges in their application. Through a detailed presentation of a comparative dataset and critical insights, valuable guidance is provided for future research, particularly in the strategic selection of materials and structure designs, to advance practical de‐icing solutions in real‐world applications.








Abstract
To tackle the formidable challenges posed by extreme cold weather events, significant advancements have been made in developing functional surfaces capable of efficiently removing accreted ice. Nevertheless, many of these surfaces still require external energy input, such as electrical power, which raises concerns regarding their alignment with global sustainability goals. Over the past decade, increasing attention has been directed toward photothermal surface designs that harness solar energy−a resource available on Earth in quantities exceeding the total reserves of coal and oil combined. By converting solar energy into heat, these designs enable the transformation of the interfacial solid‐solid contact (ice‐substrate) into a liquid‐solid contact (water‐substrate), significantly reducing interfacial adhesion and facilitating rapid ice removal. This critical perspective begins by emphasizing the advantages of photothermal design over traditional de‐icing methods. It then delves into an in‐depth analysis of three primary photothermal mechanisms, examining how these principles have expanded the scope of de‐icing technologies and contributed to advancements in photothermal surface design. Finally, key fundamental and technical challenges are identified, offering strategic guidelines for future research aimed at enabling practical, real‐world applications.

Red, green, and blue (R/G/B) colored 2D perovskite nanocrystals synthesized via an ultrasonic spray method demonstrate outstanding photo‐detection performance in 4‐inch photodetector arrays with a 100% operational yield, enabled by a liquid‐bridge‐transport strategy. This scalable, self‐aligned synthesis provides a practical pathway for high‐performance, large‐area perovskite optoelectronic devices and shows promising potential for broader applications in integrated optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
2D perovskite (PVSK) single crystals have received significant attention due to their unique optical and optoelectronic properties. However, current synthesis methods face limitations, particularly in large‐area fabrication, which remain critical barriers to practical applications. In this study, the synthesis of red/green/purple‐blue‐colored 2D PVSK nanocrystals over a large area (4‐inch wafer) and the fabrication of high‐performance photodetector arrays are presented via a facile yet efficient spray‐coating approach with a liquid‐bridge transport effect. The photodetector array achieves 100% working yield, high photo‐responsivity (1.5 × 106 A W−1) and specific‐detectivity (1.1 × 1016 Jones) with competitive photomapping characteristics. An intelligent vision system for automatic shape recognition is further demonstrated with a recognition rate exceeding 90%. This study provides significant advances in the scalable synthesis of nanoscale 2D PVSK crystals, their integration into large‐area optoelectronic devices, and their potential use in artificial‐intelligence systems.

A geometric isomerization strategy is reported to modulate the electron and energy states of metal‐free COF‐based catalysts via introducing bithiophene units featuring diverse substitutions. The asymmetric 2,3‐substitution COFs with enhanced dipole moment and non‐uniform charge distribution show high electrocatalytic activity, with the pentacyclic‐carbon (thiophene β‐position) far from sulfur atoms emerging as active sites.








Abstract
Embedding isomer entities onto crystalline frameworks with precisely defined spatial distributions represents a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, accurately constructing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate energy state effectively remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative geometric isomerization strategy aimed at minimizing the rotational barrier energy (ΔE), average local ionization energy (ALIE), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for ORR within COFs is proposed. Based on this strategy, isomeric Py‐COF‐αα with 2,2‐substitution, Py‐COF‐ββ with 3,3‐substitution, and Py‐COF‐αβ with 2,3‐substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, Py‐COF‐αβ with lower ΔE between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half‐wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal‐free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non‐uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic‐carbon (thiophene β‐position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.

Interface design is a promising strategy to help TVNGs achieve goals ranging from simple performance improvements to ingenious construction of novel functionalities. Herein, the frontier advances on interface design for TVNGs are elaborately outlined for the first time, which details the tribovoltaic effect mechanisms, diverse interface strategies, and outlines existing challenges and future prospects.








Abstract
Tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG), which manifests distinct advantages of direct‐current output characteristics and remarkable energy utilization efficiency, is an emerging energy technology relying on the coupling of semiconductor and contact electrification. Dynamic semiconductor interface is the key to TVNGs, as its performance and functionality largely depend on the design and optimization of interface.

First, the underlying mechanisms of tribovoltaic effect at the interface are elaborated, as well as some governing equations and key interface design concepts. Subsequently, diverse strategies for advanced interface design are highlighted, including modulating interfacial charge dynamics, multi‐energy coupling, reducing interface wear loss, and extending flexible/wearable application. At last, some assumptions about the future direction and prospects of advanced interface design in efficient, multifunctional TVNGs are presented.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the skin mucus of Andrias davidianus and its derived engineered microspheres have been shown to promote angiogenesis and modulate the inflammatory microenvironment by inducing the polarization of reparative macrophages, thus contributing to wound healing. This is an excellent paradigm for harnessing cross‐species regenerative capabilities to address impaired wound repair, introducing a novel therapeutic strategy for refractory wounds.








Abstract
Harnessing cross‐species regenerative cues to direct human regenerative potential is increasingly recognized as an excellent strategy in regenerative medicine, particularly for addressing the challenges of impaired wound healing in aging populations. The skin mucus of Andrias davidianus plays a critical role in self‐protection and tissue repair, yet the fundamental regenerative factors and mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, this work presents evidence that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) derived from the skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SAGs) serve as potent mediators of angiogenesis and inflammatory remodeling, facilitating efficient healing of diabetic wounds. Mechanistic studies reveal that SAGs promote macrophage polarization toward an anti‐inflammatory and pro‐regenerative phenotype (CD206+/Arg1+) via glucolipid metabolic reprogramming. This process suppresses excessive inflammation and enhances the expression of VEGF and IL‐10 to create a facilitative microenvironment for tissue regeneration. Additionally, this work develops SAGs‐GelMA composite microspheres that address multiple stages of wound healing, including rapid hemostasis, exudate control, and activation of endogenous regenerative processes. This engineered approach significantly improves the scarless healing of diabetic wounds by facilitating the recruitment and activation of reparative macrophages. The findings offer new insights into the regenerative mechanisms of Andrias davidianus and highlight the potential therapeutic application of SAGs in tissue repair.

While significant progress is made in superhydrophobic materials, sustainable superoleophobic surfaces remain a challenge. However, bioinspiration and experimental techniques supported by computational platforms are paving the way to new renewable and biodegradable repellent surfaces that meet environmental standards without sacrificing performance. Nevertheless, despite environmental concerns, and policies, several bioinspired designs still continue to apply fluorination and other environmentally harmful techniques to achieve the required standard of repellency. As discussed in this critical review, a new paradigm that integrates advanced materials characterization, nanotechnology, additive manufacturing, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence is coming, to generate bioinspired materials with tailored superhydrophobicity and superoleophobicity while adhering to environmental standards.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (e‐NO3RR) shows promise for NH3 synthesis but suffer from insufficient activity. One mechanism is proposed to integrate a proton donor for O‐end e‐NO3RR. Based on that, a model catalyst with Cu single atoms on La‐based nanoparticles is designed, achieving exceptional efficiency and stability. This paves the way for innovative electrocatalyst design in NH3 production and beyond.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is vital in global production and energy cycles. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (e‐NO3RR) offers a promising route for nitrogen (N) conversion and NH3 synthesis, yet it faces challenges like competing reactions and low catalyst activity. This study proposes a synergistic mechanism incorporating a proton donor to mediate O‐end e‐NO3RR, addressing these limitations. A novel method combining ultraviolet radiation reduction, confined synthesis, and microwave treatment was developed to create a model catalyst embedding Cu single atoms on La‐based nanoparticles (p‐CNCusLan‐m). DFT analysis emphasizes the critical role of La‐based clusters as proton donors in e‐NO3RR, while in situ characterization reveals an O‐end adsorption reduction mechanism. The catalyst achieves a remarkable Faraday efficiency (FENH3) of 97.7%, producing 10.6 mol gmetal−1 h−1 of NH3, surpassing most prior studies. In a flow cell, it demonstrated exceptional stability, with only a 9% decrease in current density after 111 hours and a NH3 production rate of 1.57 mgNH3/h/cm−2. The proton donor mechanism's effectiveness highlights its potential for advancing electrocatalyst design. Beyond NH3 production, the O‐end mechanism opens avenues for exploring molecular‐oriented coupling reactions in e‐NO3RR, paving the way for innovative electrochemical synthesis applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Highly cycle‐stable photo‐assisted all‐solid‐state sodium‐metal batteries are successfully designed and constructed based on computational screening of catalytic active fillers and mechanical reinforcement from natural lignocellulose fillers, combined with the coupling mechanism of light‐driven and photoelectrochemical storage. These innovations enable the flexible photo‐assisted pouch battery to achieve a high discharge capacity of 117 mAh g−1, while maintaining 89.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The advancement of photo‐assisted rechargeable sodium‐metal batteries with high energy efficiency, lightweight structure, and simplified design is crucial for the growing demand in portable electronics. However, addressing the intrinsic safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and the sluggish reaction kinetics in existing photoelectrochemical storage cathodes (PSCs) remains a significant challenge. In this work, functionalized light‐driven composite solid electrolyte (CSE) fillers are systematically screened, and optimized PSC materials are employed to construct advanced photo‐assisted solid‐state sodium‐metal battery (PSSMB). To further enhance the mechanical properties and poly(ethylene oxide) compatibility of the CSE, natural lignocellulose is incorporated, enabling the fabrication of flexible PSSMBs. In situ tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that the light‐driven electric field facilitated sodium salt dissociation, reduced interfacial resistance, and improved ionic conductivity (0.1 mS cm−1). Meanwhile, energy‐level matching of the PSC maximized the utilization of photogenerated carriers, accelerating reaction kinetics and enhancing interface compatibility between the electrolyte and cathode. The resulting flexible pouch‐type PSSMB demonstrates a remarkable discharge capacity of 117 mAh g−1 and outstanding long‐term cycling stability, retaining 89.1% of its capacity and achieving an energy storage efficiency of 96.8% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study highlights a versatile strategy for advancing safe, high‐performance solid‐state batteries.

<title>Etchless InSe Cavities Based on Bound States in the Continuum for Enhanced Exciton‐Mediated Emission</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An etchless bound‐state‐in‐the‐continuum polymer cavity is designed on a 2D InSe flake, achieving an impressive photoluminescence enhancement of 218 times. The exciton‐exciton scattering in InSe is intensively amplified on cavity, which is unobservable off‐cavity. Second harmonic generation in InSe can also be significantly enhanced by 404 times. The etchless cavity concept can be extended to other nanostructures beyond grating.








Abstract
Recently, fervent research interest is sparked to indium selenide (γ‐InSe) due to its dazzling optical and electronic properties. The direct bandgap in the near‐infrared (NIR) range ensures efficient carrier recombination in InSe, promoting impressive competency for lavish NIR applications. Nevertheless, the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of InSe is significantly limited by out‐of‐plane (OP) excitons, adverse to practical devices. Herein, a facile and effective solution is proposed by introducing photonic bound‐states‐in‐the‐continuum (BIC) modes to enhance excitons in InSe through strengthened exciton‐photon coupling. This cavity is constructed simply by patterning a polymer grating onto the InSe flake without an etching process, achieving an impressive PL enhancement of over 200 times. By adjusting the cavity resonance wavelength, it can selectively amplify the exciton emission or the exciton‐exciton scattering process, which is not observable off‐cavity at room temperature. Additionally, the second harmonic generation (SHG) process in InSe can also be largely enhanced by over 400 times on the cavity. Notably, the etchless cavity design can be further extended to other nanostructures beyond grating. This research presents a feasible and efficient approach to enhancing the optical performance of OP excitons, paving a prospective avenue for advanced linear and nonlinear photonic devices.

<title>Mechanically Compatible Sealing of Hydrogel with Coherent Interface</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414515?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A mechanically compatible seal is proposed for preventing hydrogels from water loss and swelling. This seal is made of a carbon‐based elastomer blended with oligomers for controlling modulus and with polar polymeric domains for forming coherent interfaces, resulting in orders of magnitude improvements in the longevity of hydrogels without sacrificing their softness and stretchability.








Abstract
Long‐term operation of hydrogels relies on protective coatings to avoid water swelling or evaporation, but these protections often cause substantial decreases in overall softness and stretchability. Here, a mechanically compatible seal with a coherent interfacial design is developed to encapsulate hydrogels. This seal is made from polybutylene (PIB) and polypropylene‐graft‐maleic anhydride (PP‐g‐MAH) blended poly(styrene‐isobutylene‐styrene) (SIBS). The PIB oligomers soften the SIBS networks, while the MAH groups facilitate covalent bonding between the SIBS and hydrogel. The sealed hydrogel exhibits an elastic modulus of 24 kPa and an elongation at a break of >1000%, both comparable to those of the pristine hydrogel. The adhesion energy between the seal and hydrogel reached >140 J m−2 and can be further increased to >400 J m−2 by a thermal treatment. This tough interface, together with the intrinsically low water vapor transmission rate of SIBS, allows the sealed hydrogel to maintain its modulus and stretchability after 10 days of drying in air. The sealed hydrogel is chemically and mechanically stable under harsh conditions, including acidic/alkaline/salty solutions, high temperatures, and cyclic mechanical deformation. This strategy applies to various hydrogels with diverse compositions and structures, leading to orders of magnitude improvements in the longevity of hydrogel‐based electronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spin‐dependent optical emission is observed in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide band of wavelengths from the violet to the near‐infrared, and attributed to spin defect pairs. These broadband spin pairs are found to exist naturally in a variety of samples from bulk crystals to powders to epitaxial films, and can be coherently controlled across the entire wavelength range.








Abstract
Optically addressable solid‐state spins are an important platform for practical quantum technologies. Van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising host as it contains a wide variety of optical emitters, but thus far observations of addressable spins have been sparse, and most of them lacked a demonstration of coherent spin control. Here, robust optical readout of spin pairs in hBN is demonstrated with emission wavelengths spanning from violet to the near‐infrared. It is found that these broadband spin pairs exist naturally in a variety of hBN samples from bulk crystals to powders to epitaxial films, and can be coherently controlled across the entire wavelength range. Furthermore, the optimal wavelengths are identified for independent readout of spin pairs and boron vacancy spin defects co‐existing in the same sample. These results establish the ubiquity of the optically addressable spin pair system in hBN across a broad parameter space, making it a versatile playground for spin‐based quantum technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel robotic system that comprises a microrobot couple, characterizing cooperative interactions, non‐contact manipulation, and high cargo transport velocity is introduced. This microrobot couple can switch between capture and release states, facilitating effective cooperation. Using these capabilities, targeted drug delivery in a stomach model is conducted and performed the removal of uterine fibroids in a uterine model.








Abstract
Magnetic interfacial microrobots are increasingly recognized as a promising approach for potential biomedical applications ranging from electronic functionalization to minimally invasive surgery and targeted drug delivery. Nevertheless, existing research faces challenges, including less cooperative interactions, contact‐based cargo manipulation, and slow transport velocity. Here, the cooperative magnetic interfacial microrobot couple (CMIMC) is proposed to address the above challenges. The CMIMC can be maneuvered by a single magnet and readily switched between capture and release states. By leveraging cooperative interactions and meticulous engineering of capillary forces through shape design and surface treatment, the CMIMC demonstrates the ability to perform non‐contact cargo manipulation. Using the synergy of preferred magnetization directions and magnetic field distribution, along with optimization of the resistance‐reducing shape, the CMIMC significantly enhances the cargo transport velocity, reaching 12.2 body length per second. The studies demonstrate various biomedical applications like targeted drug delivery and myomectomy, paving the way for the broad implementation of interfacial microrobots in biomedical fields.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dry battery electrode (DBE) technology simplifies electrode production but relies on PTFE, which faces regulatory and performance challenges. The study introduces a “bollard hitch” dual‐binder system using poly(acrylic acid)‐grafted sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PC) and minimal PTFE, reducing PTFE use by over 70%. This innovation enhances conductivity, flexibility, and mass loading, enabling sustainable, high‐performance battery production.








Abstract
The dry battery electrode (DBE) process offers significant advantages over conventional wet‐coating methods for electrode fabrication. Unlike traditional processes that rely on toxic solvents such as N‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone (NMP), the DBE technique uses solvent‐free methods, reducing environmental impact and production costs while enhancing compatibility and performance. However, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the only binder currently used for large‐scale DBE fabrication (binder fibrillation), faces potential regulatory restrictions under Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) guidelines and limits Li‐ion conductivity, elastomeric properties, and particle adhesion. This study explores a novel dual‐binder system, termed the “bollard hitch” model, designed to overcome these limitations as the first PTFE‐less binder for binder fibrillation. Poly(acrylic acid)‐grafted sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PC) acts as the “bollard,” strongly attaching to the PTFE “anchor.” This binder system reduces PTFE usage by over 70% and enables the fabrication of high‐mass loading cathodes (up to 90 mg cm−2, 15.6 mAh cm−2) with superior performance. It enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, making it suitable for high‐voltage applications and offering great potential to revolutionize the manufacturing of high‐performance, durable energy storage systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dual‐gradient silk‐based hydrogel is developed via an electric‐field‐driven method to enhance osteochondral regeneration. By integrating biomechanical and biochemical gradients, the hydrogel mimics native tissue architecture, directing site‐specific cell differentiation. Encapsulated TGF‐β1 nanocapsules ensure sustained release, promoting cartilage formation and subchondral bone remodeling, demonstrating its potential for regenerative medicine and targeted therapies.








Abstract
Contemporary clinical interventions for cartilage injuries focus on symptom management through pharmaceuticals and surgical procedures. Recent research has aimed at developing innovative scaffolds with biochemical elements, yet challenges like inadequate targeted delivery and reduced load‐bearing capacity hinder their adoption. Inspired by the spatial gradients of biophysical and biochemical cues in native osteochondral tissues, a silk‐based hydrogel that facilitates spontaneous dual‐gradient formation, including mechanical gradients and growth factor gradients, for tissue regeneration, is presented. Driven by an electrical field, the hydrogel transitions from stiff to soft along the anode‐to‐cathode direction, mimicking the anisotropic structure of natural tissues. Simultaneously, incorporated growth factors encapsulated by charged monomers migrate to the cathode region, creating another parallel gradient that enables their sustained release. This design maintains bioactivity and enhances programmable growth factor concentration in the defect environment. In a rabbit model with full‐thickness osteochondral defects, the dual‐gradient hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for promoting osteochondral regeneration, offering a promising tool for clinical translation.

This study reports robust, 100% field‐free spin‐orbit torque (SOT) switching in a RuO2(101)/[Co/Pt]2/Ta structure. Z‐polarized spins generate out‐of‐plane anti‐damping torque, enabling deterministic switching without an external magnetic field. The altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) in RuO2 enhances anisotropic spin current generation, demonstrating the potential of RuO2 as an efficient spin current source.








Abstract
Altermagnetism, a newly identified class of magnetism blending characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, is emerging as a compelling frontier in spintronics. This study reports a groundbreaking discovery of robust, 100% field‐free spin‐orbit torque (SOT) switching in a RuO2(101)/[Co/Pt]2/Ta structure. The experimental results reveal that the spin currents, induced by the in‐plane charge current, flow along the [100] axis, with the spin polarization direction aligned parallel to the Néel vector. These z‐polarized spins generate an out‐of‐plane anti‐damping torque, enabling deterministic switching of the Co/Pt layer without the necessity of an external magnetic field. The altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) in RuO2 promotes the generation of spin currents with pronounced anisotropic behavior, maximized when the charge current flows along the [010] direction. This unique capability yields the highest field‐free switching ratio, maintaining stable SOT switching even under a wide range of external magnetic fields, demonstrating exceptional resistance to magnetic interference. Notably, the ASSE‐dominated spin current is found to be most effective when the current is aligned with the [010] direction. The study highlights the potential of RuO2 as a powerful spin current generator, opening new avenues for advancing spin‐torque switching technologies and other cutting‐edge spintronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A direct hybrid bonding method that enables both gold and parylene bonding without adhesives is developed. This technique achieves full‐surface direct bonding of electrodes and substrates in flexible electronic connections. The method offers high flexibility, stable mechanical durability, and high‐resolution interconnections, accommodating varying electrode shapes and sizes in flexible electronic applications.








Abstract
The integration of multiple flexible electronics is crucial for the development of ultra‐flexible wearable and implantable devices. To fabricate an integrated system, robust and flexible bonding throughout the connection area, irrespective of the electrode or substrate, is needed. Conventional methods for flexible direct bonding have primarily been confined to metal electrodes or substrate‐only bonding due to varying material properties. Consequently, the mechanical and electrical properties of the connections deteriorate based on their shape and size. This study introduces a bonding technique for wearable electronics, achieving strong, flexible connections between materials like gold and parylene at a low temperature (85 °C). This hybrid direct bonding method ensures strong bonding across both the Au electrode and parylene substrate within electronic interconnections. Additionally, a 3D‐stacked flexible structure that maintains robustness and high flexibility without an adhesive layer is successfully developed. An ultrathin photoplethysmography sensor developed by stacking an ultrathin organic photodetector atop an organic light‐emitting diode is demonstrated. Unlike traditional methods requiring adhesives or high pressure, this approach maintains flexibility essential for deformation, withstanding bending at a radius of 0.5 mm. The technique's robustness suggests promising applications in durable, ultra‐flexible electronics integration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
vdW Janus topological insulator is presented with stochastic inversion asymmetry via penetrative single‐step plasma sulfurization, which enables the large‐scale synthesis, one‐step process, and low‐temperature condition with back‐end‐of‐line process compatibility. Sulfur dominance and its corresponding spatial OOP domain distribution are spatially observed using piezoelectric force microscopy hysteresis mapping, cross‐sectional transmission electron microscopy, top‐view scanning electroc microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and force‐distance curve mapping. This provides an extendable synthetic solution for stochastic and size‐controllable challenge‐response pairs generation for PUFs application, which can overcome the conventional limitations of encryption technology.








Abstract
Owing to the exotic state of quantum matter, topological insulators have emerged as a significant platform for new‐generation functional devices. Among these topological insulators, tetradymites have received significant attention because of their van der Waals (vdW) structures and inversion symmetries. Although this inversion symmetry completely blocks exotic quantum phenomena, it should be broken down to facilitate versatile topological functionalities. Recently, a Janus structure is suggested for asymmetric out‐of‐plane lattice structures, terminating the heterogeneous atoms at two sides of the vdW structure. However, the synthesis of Janus structures has not been achieved commercially because of the imprecise control of the layer‐by‐layer growth, high‐temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, plasma sulfurization of vdW topological insulators has been presented, enabling stochastic inversion asymmetry. To take practical advantage of the random lattice distortion, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been suggested as applications of vdW Janus topological insulators. The sulfur dominance is experimentally demonstrated via X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hysteresis variation, cross‐sectional transmission electron microscopy, and adhesion energy variation. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the vdW Janus topological insulators can provide an extendable encryption platform for randomized lattice distortion, offering on‐demand stochastic inversion asymmetry via a single‐step plasma sulfurization.

[Ru(bpy)2]2+ photosensitive components are integrated into the Cu‐HHTP MOF, coordinating with the Cu‐O4 sites to assemble a bi‐functional unit, thereby facilitating efficient local electron migration. Compared to the dissociative photosensitizer system, this newly constructed configuration exhibits a significant increase in the efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier transfer, resulting in a 37.2‐fold enhancement in the photosynthesis of H2O2.








Abstract
Photosensitizer‐assisted photocatalytic systems offer a solution to overcome the limitations of inherent light harvesting capabilities in catalysts. However, achieving efficient charge transfer between the dissociative photosensitizer and catalyst poses a significant challenge. Incorporating photosensitive components into reactive centers to establish well‐defined charge transfer channels is expected to effectively address this issue. Herein, the electrostatic‐driven self‐assembly method is utilized to integrate photosensitizers into metal–organic frameworks, constructing atomically Ru‐Cu bi‐functional units to promote efficient local electron migration. Within this newly constructed system, the [Ru(bpy)2]2+ component and Cu site serve as photosensitive and catalytic active centers for photocarrier generation and H2O2 production, respectively, and their integration significantly reduces the barriers to charge transfer. Ultrafast spectroscopy and in situ characterization unveil accelerated directional charge transfer over Ru‐Cu units, presenting orders of magnitude improvement over dissociative photosensitizer systems. As a result, a 37.2‐fold enhancement of the H2O2 generation rate (570.9 µmol g−1 h−1) over that of dissociative photosensitizer system (15.3 µmol g−1 h−1) is achieved. This work presents a promising strategy for integrating atomic‐scale photosensitive and catalytic active centers to achieve ultrafast photocarrier transfer and enhanced photocatalytic performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Analogic to the design of an anionic framework for inorganic sulfide/oxide solid electrolytes, a copolymeric polycationic electrolyte, P(AT‐MBA‐6F), that leverages the polycationic backbones with fluorinated microdomain trapping effect is constructed, which enables stable, fast and high‐energy all‐solid‐state LMBs at ambient temperature.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising for high‐energy and high‐safety solid‐state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, a polycationic solid electrolyte (PCSE) is described that leverages the inherent high thermal/chemical stability of the polycationic domain and the anion trapping (FMAT) effect of another fluorinated microdomain for stable and fast‐charging high‐voltage LMBs. Specifically, while the polycationic imidazolium backbone ensures high segmental flexibility facilitating the Li+ mobility, the fluorinated microdomain effectively traps the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions by strong dipole interactions, imparting localized solvation and restricted mobility of the anions, as well as improved oxidation stability. As a result, the PCSE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.4 mS cm−1, a high Li+ transference number of 0.50, and a wide electrochemical window of ∼5.5 V at 25 °C. By way of in situ thermal polymerization of the electrolyte within assembled cells, the PCSE enables ultra‐stable cycling of Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells with a capacity retention of 98.1% after 500 cycles at 0.2 C at ambient temperatures. The work on the molecular design of PCSEs represents a fundamentally unique perspective for the rational design of SPEs with balanced properties that are historically challenging for high‐energy, long‐life, ambient‐temperature solid‐state LMBs.

This review comprehensively summaries the recent progresses on the interface engineering of 2D materials toward high‐temperature electronic devices, including FETs, optoelectronic devices, sensors, and neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
High‐temperature electronic materials and devices are highly sought after for advanced applications in aerospace, high‐speed automobiles, and deep‐well drilling, where active or passive cooling mechanisms are either insufficient or impractical. 2D materials (2DMs) represent promising alternatives to traditional silicon and wide‐bandgap semiconductors (WBG) for nanoscale electronic devices operating under high‐temperature conditions. The development of robust interfaces is essential for ensuring that 2DMs and their devices achieve high performance and maintain stability when subjected to elevated temperatures. This review summarizes recent advancements in the interface engineering of 2DMs for high‐temperature electronic devices. Initially, the limitations of conventional silicon‐based materials and WBG semiconductors, alongside the advantages offered by 2DMs, are examined. Subsequently, strategies for interface engineering to enhance the stability of 2DMs and the performance of their devices are detailed. Furthermore, various interface‐engineered 2D high‐temperature devices, including transistors, optoelectronic devices, sensors, memristors, and neuromorphic devices, are reviewed. Finally, a forward‐looking perspective on future 2D high‐temperature electronics is presented. This review offers valuable insights into emerging 2DMs and their applications in high‐temperature environments from both fundamental and practical perspectives.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To investigate the effects of topological characteristics of polymers on their lymph node (LN) targeting activity and how their molecular weight (MW) influences pharmacokinetics to support LN homing, a series of polymer‐TLR agonist conjugates (PTACs) are designed. Among the conjugates, the dendritic 6‐arm PTAC with an MW of 60 kDa demonstrated the highest LN drainage, deepest penetration, and prolonged retention. As a result, it induced broad antibody and T cell responses, enhancing vaccine immunogenicity and suppressing tumor growth.









Abstract
Strategically targeting lymph nodes (LNs) to orchestrate the initiation and regulation of adaptive immune responses is one of the most pressing challenges in the context of vaccination. Herein, a series of polymer‐TLR agonist conjugates (PTACs) is developed to investigate the impact of dendritic‐topological characteristics on their LN targeting activity in vivo, and their molecular weight (MW) on their pharmacokinetics in support of their LN homing. Notably, the dendritic 6‐arm PTAC with a MW of 60 kDa (6A‐PTAC‐60k) rapidly delivered cargo to draining LNs after administration to peripheral tissues. Specifically, this topologic structure ameliorated the targeting behavior within lymphatic vessels and LNs, including an elevated amount of TLR7/8 agonist delivered to the LNs, an improved distribution pattern among barrier cells and immune cells, increased permeability, and prolonged retention. Furthermore, the 6A‐PTAC‐60k formulation induced broad antibody and T cell responses, enhancing vaccine immunogenicity and suppressing tumor growth. The results revealed that both the topology and MW of polymers are crucial factors for immunoadjuvant distribution and their functional activity in the draining LNs, which, in turn, enhanced the immunogenicity of the vaccine formulation. This study may provide a chemical and structural basis for optimizing the design of immunoadjuvant delivery systems.

<title>Diluted Ternary Heterojunctions to Suppress Charge Recombination for Organic Solar Cells with 21% Efficiency</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419923?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diluted heterojunctions are employed to increase the structure order in the layer‐by‐layer fabricated solar cells and polymeric diluent is found superior that the small molecular diluent, creating OSC having dual fibrils with significantly increased absorption and reduced charge recombination to realize an efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%).








Abstract
As an exitonic photovoltaic device, organic solar cells (OSCs) consist of electron donating and accepting components in their photoactive layer, in which the molecular interactions between donor and acceptor can significantly affect the nanoscale morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. In this work, by diluting electron donor with electron acceptor having opposite electrostatic potentials to promote the structural order via strengthened intermolecular interactions, this study shows that polymeric diluent is more effective due to its long‐ranged conjugated backbone compared with small molecular diluent. The ternary heterojunction made of C5‐16:L8‐BO binary acceptors diluted with D18 shows the strongest structural order, benefiting from the strong interactions between L8‐BO and C5‐16. The enhanced structural order within the photoactive layer prepared by layer‐by‐layer deposition of the diluted p‐type and n‐type heterojunctions contributes to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transport, and inhibited charge recombination. As the result, OSC based on D18 (PY‐IT diluted)/L8‐BO:C5‐16 (D18 diluted) having donor and acceptor dual fibrils obtains an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%), which is one of the highest certified PCE up to date.

<title>Polarization Boost and Ferroelectricity Down to One Unit Cell in Layered Carpy‐Galy La2Ti2O7 Thin Films</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study explores ultrathin epitaxial La2Ti2O7 films, a layered perovskite from the Carpy‐Galy family, grown on various substrates. Remarkably, high epitaxial strain promotes layer‐by‐layer growth and stabilizes the correct phase. The films exhibit a polarization significantly higher than previously reported, exceeding 18 µCcm−2, and retain ferroelectricity down to a single‐unit‐cell thickness, highlighting their potential for advanced nanoscale devices.








Abstract
Layered perovskite‐based compounds offer a range of unconventional properties enabled by their naturally anisotropic structure. Among these, the Carpy‐Galy phases (AnBnO3n+2), characterized by (110)‐oriented perovskite planes interleaved with additional oxygen layers, stand out for robust in‐plane polarization. However, the challenges associated with the synthesis of ultrathin Carpy‐Galy films and understanding the impact of strain on their properties limit their integration into devices. Here, La2Ti2O7 (n = 4) films grown on substrates imposing tensile, compressive, or negligible epitaxial strains are investigated. Surprisingly, a 3% tensile strain from DyScO3 (100) substrates facilitates layer‐by‐layer growth mode, whereas compressive (LaAlO3‐Sr2TaAlO6 (110)) or negligible (SrTiO3 (110)) epitaxial strains require post‐deposition annealing to reach comparable crystallinity. Using density‐functional theory calculations, scanning probe microscopy, X‐ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and polarization switching experiments, it is confirmed that these films possess exceptional ferroelectric properties, including a polarization of 18 µCcm−2 – more than three times higher than previously reported – as well as persistence of ferroelectricity down to a single‐unit‐cell thickness. This study not only advances the understanding of Carpy‐Galy phases as epitaxial thin films but also lays a foundation for their integration into advanced ferroelectric device architectures.

<title>Si‐CMOS Compatible Synthesis of Wafer‐Scale 1T‐CrTe2 with Step‐Like Magnetic Transition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study provides a Si‐CMOS compatible approach to synthesize 2D wafer‐scale 1T‐CrTe2 films. Magnetic property measurements reveal that the synthesized 1T‐CrTe2 films exhibit room‐temperature magnetism, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and distinct step‐like magnetic transitions. Moreover, the study highlights how unintentional adsorbents or dopants can significantly influence the magnetic behaviors of such 1T‐CrTe2 films.








Abstract
2D room‐temperature ferromagnet CrTe2 is a promising candidate material for spintronic applications. However, its large‐scale and cost‐effective synthesis remains a challenge. Here, the fine controllable synthesis of wafer‐scale 1T‐CrTe2 films is reported on a SiO2/Si substrate using plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition at temperatures below 400 °C. Magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal that the synthesized 1T‐CrTe2 films exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy along with distinct step‐like magnetic transitions. It is found that 1T‐CrTe2 is susceptible to oxygen adsorption even in ambient conditions. The theoretical calculations indicate that the oxidation of surface layers is crucial for the absence of out‐of‐plane easy axis in few‐layer CrTe2, while the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling among the upper surface layers leads to the observed step‐like magnetic transitions. The study provides a Si‐CMOS compatible approach for the fabrication of magnetic 2D materials and highlights how unintentional adsorbents or dopants can significantly influence the magnetic behaviors of these materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultrathin‐conjugated MOFs nanosheets with single‐crystalline characteristics are prepared by surfactant‐assisted solution synthesis strategy. The π–π stacked MOF/graphene van der Waals heterostructure can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode‐locking with femtosecond pulse duration and high‐order harmonic mode‐locking with GHz repetition frequency. This preferable stacking exhibits superior π‐conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their outstanding characteristics. However, due to the strong interlayer π–π stacking interactions, the preparation of high‐quality and atomic‐scale single‐crystalline conjugated MOF structures continues to pose a significant challenge. The investigation of its nonlinear optical (NLO) property and application for ultrafast photonics is still rare. Herein, the ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 and Ni3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11‐hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single‐crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant‐assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the π–π stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG‐VHS and NiNsG‐VHS) are achieved by ultrasound‐assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior π‐conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third‐order NLO polarizability of CuNsG‐VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near‐infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG‐VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode‐locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high‐order harmonic mode‐locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An autonomous, moisture‐driven flexible electrogenerative dressing (AMFED) is developed by integrating a moist‐electric generator, an antibacterial hydrogel dressing, and concentric molybdenum electrodes. This self‐sustaining dressing provides continuous electrical stimulation and exhibits potent antibacterial activity. In vivo studies demonstrate that AMFED effectively accelerates diabetic wound healing.








Abstract
Electrotherapy has shown considerable potential in treating chronic wounds, but conventional approaches relying on bulky external power supplies and mechanical force are limited in their clinical utility. This study introduces an autonomous, moisture‐driven flexible electrogenerative dressing (AMFED) that overcomes these limitations. The AMFED integrates a moist‐electric generator (MEG), an antibacterial hydrogel dressing, and concentric molybdenum (Mo) electrodes to provide a self‐sustaining electrical supply and potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The MEG harnesses chemical energy from moisture to produce a stable direct current of 0.61 V without external input, delivering this therapeutic electrical stimulation to the wound site through the Mo electrodes. The AMFED facilitates macrophage polarization toward reparative M2 phenotype and regulates inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, in vivo studies suggest that the AMFED group significantly enhances chronic wound healing, with an approximate 41% acceleration compared to the control group. Using a diabetic mouse wound model, the AMFED demonstrates its effectiveness in promoting nerve regulation, epithelial migration, and vasculogenesis. These findings present a novel and efficient platform for accelerating chronic wound healing.

A series of 1D stable magnetic inorganic electrides are identified by high throughput screening and experimental synthesis. Furthermore, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit various applications, including spintronics, topological electronics, low work function, electron emission, and high‐performance catalysts for NH3 reductions.








Abstract
Inorganic electrides, which are characterized by the presence of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) within distinct geometric cavities, exhibit unique properties and have garnered significant attention in various fields. Nevertheless, inorganic electrides face significant challenges in terms of their stability and magnetic topological states. To address these issues, a combination of high‐throughput screening, first‐principles calculations, and experimental synthesis is used to identify a series of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides with diverse properties and applications. Specifically, 17 ferromagnetic (FM) and 19 antiferromagnetic (AFM) 1D inorganic electrides, with different topological bulk and surface states are reported. Moreover, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit lower work functions (≈3 eV) on the (001) surface, significantly enhancing their applications in ammonia synthesis. Further experimental synthesis and characterization suggested that 1D inorganic electrides exhibit extremely high stability owing to the strong hybridization between IAEs and atoms and the small surface area of IAEs. These findings involve the screening, investigation, preparation, and application of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides, heralding a new era in the study of 1D inorganic electrides in topological quantum science, spintronics, energy, and the corresponding interdisciplinary areas.

<title>Two Material Properties from One Wavelength‐Orthogonal Photoresin Enabled by a Monochromatic Laser Integrated Stereolithographic Apparatus (Mono LISA)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A single object with dual properties – degradable and non‐degradable – is fabricated in a single print simply by switching the printing colors. The advanced multi‐material printing is enabled by the combination of a fully wavelength‐orthogonal photoresin and a monochromatic tunable laser printer, paving the way for precise multi‐material differentiation within a single print.









Abstract
Multi‐material printing has experienced critical advances in recent years, yet material property differentiation capabilities remain limited both with regard to the accessible properties – typically hard versus soft – and the achievable magnitude of differentiation. To enhance multi‐material printing capabilities, precise photochemical control during 3D printing is essential. Wavelength‐differentiation is a particularly intriguing concept yet challenging to implement. Notably, dual‐wavelength printing to fabricate hard and soft sections within one object has emerged, where one curing process is insensitive to visible light, while UV irradiation inevitably activates the entire resin, limiting true spatio‐temporal control of the material properties. Until now, pathway‐independent wavelength‐orthogonal printing has not been realized, where each wavelength exclusively triggers only one of two possible reactions, independent of the order in which the wavelengths are applied. Herein, a multi‐wavelength printing technique is introduced employing a tunable laser to monochromatically deliver light to the printing platform loaded with a fully wavelength‐orthogonal resin. Guided by photochemical action plots, two distinct wavelengths – each highly selective toward a specific photocycloaddtion reaction – are utilized to generate distinct networks within the photoresin. Ultimately, together with the printing technique, this orthogonally addressable photoresin allows fabricating multi‐material objects with degradable and non‐degradable properties, in a single fabrication step.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By controlling the injection and transport of charge carriers through a novel quantum‐dot‐electrolyte emitting layer, quantum‐dot‐electrolyte light‐emitting diodes (QE‐LEDs) have been developed, exhibiting a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 20.0% and a lifetime (T95) of 3.74  ×  105 h at 100 cd m−2. Besides, the first active‐matrix QE‐LED display with stable emissions (>17.6 years at T95@100 cd m−2) has been fabricated.








Abstract
Electroluminescence (EL) is essential for modern technologies, such as displays, lighting, and optical communications. To date, some kinds of artificial EL devices have been developed, including organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs), quantum‐dot (QD) LEDs, and light‐emitting electrochemical cells. However, issues (e.g., inefficient charge injection, exciton quenching) limit the further EL performance. Here, another promising kind of EL device is reported, which is called QD‐electrolyte LED (QE‐LED). The key feature of QE‐LED is that an ionic liquid is doped into QDs as the electrolyte emitter of multi‐layer device architectures. Both theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that an enhanced interface electric field from the in situ formed electrical double layer is leveraged to improve the charge injection and transport. With the introduction of insulating polymers into QD‐electrolyte emitters, red QE‐LED achieves an external quantum efficiency of 20.5% and a lifetime (T95) over 3.74 × 105 h at the display‐related luminance of 100 cd m−2, indicating that the QE‐LED is among the best EL devices. Furthermore, an active‐matrix QE‐LED display is demonstrated with superior stability that overtakes the commercial benchmark. These results offer an avenue to discover unexplored EL devices and provide potential pathways to enhance charge dynamics for EL devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) with unprecedented long life and ultrahigh specific capacity are demonstrated through the design of an acceptor‐multi‐F state electrolyte. This electrolyte design endows FIBs with durable reversible fluorination/defluorination reaction (over 3700 cycles), a high‐output voltage of CuF2//Li configuration (with a discharge plateau of 2.9 V), and larger‐sized pouch‐type CuF2//Sn+SnF2 configuration (with a reversible capacity of 530 mAh g−1).








Abstract
Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) have garnered significant attention due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, dendrite‐free safety, and resource abundance. Although some anion acceptors have been proposed to address the insolubility of inorganic fluoride salts, the difficulty in dissociating fluoride ions from acceptors results in short lifespan and extremely low specific capacity of FIBs. Here, a fluoride ion battery is demonstrated with unprecedented long life and ultrahigh specific capacity through the design of an acceptor‐multi‐F state electrolyte. The high Lewis acidity of triphenylantimony chloride (TSbCl) as a novel anion acceptor in electrolyte facilitates the complete dissociation of CsF, and the resulting TSbCl‐F complex can further interact with fluoride ions to form the acceptor‐multi‐F states. This strategy combines the high dissociation capability for fluoride salts with the minimal thermodynamic barriers for releasing fluoride ions at electrode‐electrolyte interface. This electrolyte design endows FIBs with durable reversible fluorination/defluorination reaction (3700 cycles with high coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and small voltage polarization of 30 mV) and ultrahigh reversible capacity (580 mAh g−1 after 40 cycles at 100 mA g−1). The high‐output voltage FIBs of CuF2//Li configuration (with discharge plateau of 2.9 V) and larger‐sized pouch‐type FIBs of CuF2//Sn+SnF2 configuration (with reversible capacity of 530 mAh g−1) are demonstrated.

<title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Boosted by Surface Hydroxyls‐Modulated Hydrogen Migration over Nonreducible Oxides</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hydrogen spillover is considered to play a major role in ubiquitous technologies involving hydrogen. However, its application in Earth‐abundant widely‐used non‐reducible oxides is severely limited by much shorter migration distances of atomic hydrogen compared to those in reducible oxides. This study presents a surface hydroxyl modulation strategy to enhance hydrogen migration over nonreducible oxides, promoting electrocatalytic hydrogenation for water purification.








Abstract
The migration of atomic hydrogen species over heterogeneous catalysts is deemed essential for hydrogenation reactions, a process closely related to the catalyst's functionalities. While surface hydroxyls‐assisted hydrogen spillover is well documented on reducible oxide supports, its effect on widely‐used nonreducible supports, especially in electrocatalytic reactions with water as the hydrogen source, remains a subject of debate. Herein, a nonreducible oxide‐anchored copper single‐atom catalyst (Cu1/SiO2) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO2 can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu1/SiO2 catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu1/SiO2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen‐species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.

<title>Mitochondrial Transplantation via Magnetically Responsive Artificial Cells Promotes Intracerebral Hemorrhage Recovery by Supporting Microglia Immunological Homeostasis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A type of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) has been developed, demonstrating the loading of mitochondria and self‐enclosure processes to ensure the protection of mitochondrial transport via the bloodstream. The treatment with ACs effectively transplanted mitochondria around the lesion, thereby improving neurological recovery by supporting microglia immunological homeostasis after intracerebral hemorrhage.








Abstract
The immune‐inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro‐inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain. Here, a novel strategy for mitochondrial transplantation via intravenous injection of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) are proposed. ACs can protect the loaded mitochondria and selectively accumulate around the lesion under an external magnetic field (EMF). In this study, mitochondria released from ACs can effectively improve microglial mitochondrial function, attenuate their pro‐inflammatory attributes, and elevate the proportion of immunosuppressive microglia. In this way, microglia immune homeostasis in the brain is reestablished, and inflammation is attenuated, ultimately promoting functional recovery. This study presents an effective approach to transplant mitochondria into the brain, offering a promising alternative to modulate the immune‐inflammatory cascade in the brain following ICH.

The functionalized acellular mushroom scaffold promotes the healing of infectious bone defects through 1) controlling bacterial infections through Zn2+/curcumin MOFs; 2) rapid cell recruitment induced by its naturally aligned channels; 3) immune regulation and osteogenic differentiation by icariin.








Abstract
Infected bone defects are a common clinical condition, but conventional treatments often fail to achieve the desired outcomes, including addressing antibiotic resistance and preventing nonunion complications. In the presented study, a functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold is developed composed of its naturally aligned channels, Zn2+/curcumin MOFs, hydroxyapatite minerals, and icariin. In vitro, It is found that functionalized acellular mushroom stem scaffold can control bacterial infections through Zn2+/curcumin MOFs. The naturally aligned channels guide bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) migration, and the components adsorbed on the acellular substrate further promote the migration of BMSCs. Moreover, these functional components further accelerated the polarization of M2 macrophage and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In vivo, the functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold cleared infected bacteria within 3 days, induced extracellular matrix secretion and alignment, and promoted new bone formation to cover defects within 8 weeks. The functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold provides a promising strategy for treating infectious bone defects.

<title>Double Confinement Design to Access Highly Stable Intermetallic Nanoparticles for Fuel Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work depicts a double confinement design to greatly improve the stability of intermetallic nanoparticles while maintaining their high catalytic activity toward proton exchange membrane fuel cells. This synthesis strategy involves the carbon encapsulation and O2‐assisted pyrolysis process to fabricate carbon‐supported Pt‐based intermetallic nanoparticles with carbon and Pt‐skin confinement.








Abstract
Maintaining the stability of low Pt catalysts during prolonged operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) remains a substantial challenge. Here, a double confinement design is presented to significantly improve the stability of intermetallic nanoparticles while maintaining their high catalytic activity toward PEMFCs. First, a carbon shell is coated on the surface of nanoparticles to form carbon confinement. Second, O2 is introduced during the annealing process to selectively etch the carbon shell to expose the active surface, and to induce the segregation of surface transition metals to form Pt‐skin confinement. Overall, the intermetallic nanoparticles are protected by carbon confinement and Pt‐skin confinement to withstand the harsh environment of PEMFCs. Typically, the double confined Pt1Co1 catalyst exhibits an exceptional mass activity of 1.45 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V in PEMFCs tests, with only a 17.3% decay after 30 000 cycles and no observed structure changes, outperforming most reported PtCo catalysts and DOE 2025 targets. Furthermore, the carbon confinement proportion can be controlled by varying the thickness of the coated carbon shell, and this strategy is also applicable to the synthesis of double‐confined Pt1Fe1 and Pt1Cu1 intermetallic nanoparticles.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The use of electrochemical correlative ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to trigger, control, and observe changes in the optical properties of reflectin protein films is demonstrated. Voltage‐regulated charge neutralization allows tunable, reversible, and cyclic control of the water volume fraction in the reflectin film, thereby influencing its optical characteristics.








Abstract
Neuronally triggered phosphorylation drives the dynamic condensation of reflectin proteins, enabling squid to fine tune the colors reflected from specialized skin cells (iridocytes) for camouflage and communication. Reflectin, the primary component of iridocyte lamellae, forms alternating layers of protein and low refractive index extracellular space within membrane‐encapsulated structures, acting as a biologically tunable distributed Bragg reflector. In vivo, reflectin condensation induces osmotic dehydration of these lamellae, reducing their thickness and shifting the wavelength of reflected light. Inspired by this natural mechanism, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of imidazolium moieties within the protein provides a reversible and tunable method to control the water volume fraction in reflectin thin films, allowing precise, dynamic modulation of the film’s refractive index and thickness — mimicking the squid’s dynamic color adaptation. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we developed electrochemical correlative ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, enabling real‐time analysis of optical property changes of reflectin films. This electrochemically driven approach offers unprecedented control over reflectin condensation dynamics. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of biophysical processes governing cephalopod coloration but also pave the way for bio‐inspired materials and devices that seamlessly integrate biological principles with synthetic systems to bridge the biotic‐abiotic gap.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Single crystal microcavity organic light‐emitting diodes (SC‐MC‐OLEDs) with high color purity (FWHM < 10 nm), high brightness (> 106 cd m−2), high efficiency (EQE∼4%), high polarization (> 0.90) and high stability are realized by combining the large size 2D organic single crystals with efficient microcavity effect, unlocking potential for ultra‐high‐definition displays and AR/VR applications.








Abstract
The development of ultra‐high‐definition (UHD) displays demands organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity of all three primary colors for a wide color gamut and high brightness essential for future AR/VR applications. However, the vibronic coupling in organic emitters typically results in broad emissions, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) exceeding 40–50 nm. Herein, multicolor organic single‐crystal microcavity light‐emitting diodes (SC‐MC‐OLEDs) are demonstrated by embedding ultrathin 2D organic single crystals (2D‐OSCs) between two silver layers that serve as both electrodes and mirrors. By leveraging the microcavity effect, the resonant output frequencies of SC‐MC‐OLEDs can be continuously tuned from 448 to 602 nm by adjusting the thickness of 2D‐OSCs (i.e., the microcavity length), achieving high color purity with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of <10 nm. Furthermore, the Purcell effect in SC‐MC‐OLEDs enhances the radiative rate and improves light‐coupling efficiency, resulting in a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 4% and minimal efficiency roll‐off. Due to the excellent bipolar transport properties of OSCs, the brightness of SC‐MC‐OLEDs surpasses 106 cd m−2, along with a degree of linear polarization exceeding 0.9, unlocking new application opportunities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Full‐color carbon dots (FCDs) with emission wavelengths ranging from 434 to 703 nm are synthesized using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the sole precursor. The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and gain performance of the FCDs are enhanced due to cross‐linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Tunable liquid‐state laser emissions in green, yellow, red, and NIR regions are achieved with lower laser thresholds compared to RhB, demonstrating superior laser stability. Additionally, these FCDs are validated as excellent laser sources. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirmed that FCDs exhibit significantly lower toxicity and superior staining effects compared to RhB.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) serve as a novel, non‐toxic, cost‐effective, and highly‐stable solution‐processable nanolaser material. However, compared to commonly used commercial laser dyes, CDs exhibit lower photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), radiation transition rates, and gain coefficients. Consequently, this leads to higher laser thresholds that significantly impede the expansion of practical applications for CDs. Therefore, enhancing the gain performance of CDs is crucial in guiding the design of CD gain materials and promoting their practical applications. Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full‐color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B‐CDs, G‐CDs, Y‐CDs, R‐CDs, and NIR‐CDs) fluorescence through cross‐linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703 nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross‐linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load‐carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric‐expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load‐carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low‐expansion polyimide (4.52 ppm K−1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load‐carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19 Hz, a response speed of 60.96 ± 3.08°/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 ± 2.52°. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load‐carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20 800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

<title>Triple‐Additive Strategy for Enhanced Material and Device Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413712?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this report, the internal strain affecting the stability of FAPbI3 perovskite is addressed through the design of additives in the precursor solution. Instead of conventional methylammonium chloride, a triple‐additive approach is employed, leading to improved phase stability and reduced strain gradient. The strategy results in enhanced durability and efficiency, with power conversion efficiency retention of 95% after 8000 h under the ISOS‐D‐1 condition and a maximum PCE of 24.50%.








Abstract
The stability of the FAPbI3 perovskite phase is significantly affected by internal strain. In this report, additives in the perovskite precursor solution are designed to prevent local lattice mismatch of the resulting perovskite layer. Instead of using a conventional methylammonium chloride (Control), triple additives (Target) are introduced by considering ion association and formation energy. The out‐of‐plane orientation for the (100) plane is less pronounced by the triple additives compared to the Control film with a highly enhanced preferred orientation, which reduces the strain gradient and the Pb─I bond distance. Moreover, the anisotropic atomic‐level lattice strain along (111) plane, associated with the α‐to‐δ phase transition, is more uniformly distributed by the triple additives. The triple‐additive strategy demonstrates exceptional phase stability under relative humidity as high as 90% and the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS)‐L‐2 protocol. The device lifetime measured under the ISOS‐D‐1 condition shows that the Target perovskite solar cell (PSC) maintains 95% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for over 8000 h, and the best PCE of 24.50% is achieved.

<title>Glassy Thermal Transport Triggers Ultra‐High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe</title>

Inhomogeneous ferroelectric instability induced confined phonon mean free path leading to glass‐like thermal transport, and ultra‐high thermoelectric performance in BiSe, Pb co‐doped GeTe.








Abstract
The consequences of broken long‐range atomic arrangement in glasses or amorphous solids are reflected in the temperature dependence of lattice thermal conductivity (κlat). However, the appearance of glassy ultralow κlat in a crystalline solid with high electrical transport like metal is unusual but can have a remarkable impact on the thermoelectric performance of a material. Here, an ultra‐high thermoelectric performance is demonstrated with a maximum figure of merit, zT ≈ 2.7 (≈2.92 with Dulong–Petit heat capacity) via achieving glassy thermal transport along with significant electrical conductivity in ball milled BiSe, Pb co‐doped polycrystalline Ge1.03Te followed by spark plasma sintering. The glassy thermal transport results from the inhomogeneous ferroelectric instability developed due to local polar distortions near the dopant sites, which interacts with soft polar optical modes via strain fluctuations. Resulting structural degeneracy and associated soft vibrations sink heat effectively from acoustic phonons, which along with various nanoscale defects, confine the phonon mean free path (MFP) close to the interatomic distance, rendering the thermal transport glassy. However, the material still maintains a high electrical conductivity at ambient condition due to much longer MFP of the charge carriers. A promising output power density of ≈0.8 W cm−2 for ΔT ≈441 K in double‐leg thermoelectric device demonstrate the potential of this material for mid‐temperature thermoelectric applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel self‐rolling integration strategy mounts ultrathin (≈2 µm) poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide)/Au microactuators onto optical fiber tapers, achieving unprecedented bending angles (>800°) and rapid response (≈0.55 s). This waveguide microactuator enables dynamic capture of fast‐moving microorganisms and provides a high‐performance, versatile platform for biomedical applications in confined, unstructured environments.








Abstract
Precisely capturing and manipulating microscale objects, such as individual cells and microorganisms, is fundamental to advancements in biomedical research and microrobotics. Photoactuators based on optical fibers serving as flexible, unobstructed waveguides are well‐suited for these operations, particularly in confined locations where free‐space illumination is impractical. However, integrating optical fibers with microscale actuators poses significant challenges due to size mismatch, resulting in slow responses inadequate for handling motile micro‐objects. This study designs microactuators based on hydrogel/Au bilayer heterostructures that self‐roll around a tapered optical fiber. This self‐rolling mechanism enables the use of thin hydrogel layers only a few micrometers thick, which rapidly absorb and release water molecules during a phase transition. The resulting microactuators exhibit low bending stiffness and extremely fast responses, achieving large bending angles exceeding 800° within 0.55 s. Using this technique, this study successfully captures rapidly swimming Chlamydomonas and Paramecium, and demonstrates programmable non‐reciprocal motion for effective non‐contact manipulation of yeast cells. This approach provides a versatile platform for microscale manipulations and holds promise for advanced biomedical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dead APC‐4T1‐N3‐LipoH (DPNL) is constructed via clicking reprogrammed APC like‐4T1 cells with liposome encapsulating HMME (LHs). Sonosensitive DPNL cells effectively target tumor sites and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Upon ultrasound, DPNL cells could co‐stimulate the antigen‐presenting program and strikingly elicit antigen‐specific T cell‐mediated adaptive immunity in TDLNs as well as MHC‐I unrestricted NK cell‐mediated innate immunity within tumors for comprehensive sonoimmunotherapy for triple negative breast cancers.








Abstract
Ultrasound therapy has turned up as a noninvasive multifunctional tool for cancer immunotherapy. However, the insufficient co‐stimulating molecules and loss of peptide‐major histocompatibility complex I (MHC‐I) expression on tumor cells lead to poor therapy of sonoimmunotherapies. Herein, this work develops a sonosensitive system to augment MHC‐I unrestricted natural killer (NK) cell‐mediated innate immunity and T cell‐mediated adaptive immunity by leveraging antigen presentation cell (APC)‐like tumor cells. Genetically engineered tumor cells featuring sufficient co‐stimulating molecules are cryo‐shocked and conjugated with a sonosensitizer, hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether, using click chemistry. These cells (DPNLs) exhibit characteristics of tumor and draining lymph node homing. Under ultrasound, NK cell‐mediated innate immunity within the tumor microenvironment could be activated, and T cells in the tumor‐draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are stimulated through co‐stimulatory molecules. In combination with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) antibody, DPNLs extend the survival time and inhibited lung metastasis in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. This study provides an alternative approach for sonoimmunotherapy with precise sonosensitizer delivery and enhanced NK cell and T cell activation.

<title>DNA‐Capturing Manganese‐Coordinated Chitosan Microparticles Potentiate Radiotherapy via Activating the cGAS‐STING Pathway and Maintaining Tumor‐Infiltrating CD8+ T‐Cell Stemness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
DNA‐capturing CS‐Mn microparticles are prepared to potentiate radioimmunotherapy. Upon injection into the tumors after X‐ray irradiation, they undergo rapid dissociation to release chitosan which assembles with the extracellular DNA fragments released from the dead cancer cells to in situ form CS‐DNA complexes and synergize with Mn2+ to stimulate DC maturation via activating the cGAS‐STING pathway for enhanced CD8+ T‐cell stemness.








Abstract
The radiotherapy‐induced release of DNA fragments can stimulate the cyclic guanosine monophosphate‐adenosine monophosphate synthase‐stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS‐STING) pathway to prime antitumor immunity, but this pathway is expected to be less potent because of the inefficient cytosolic delivery of negatively charged DNA fragments. In this study, manganese‐coordinated chitosan (CS‐Mn) microparticles with selective DNA‐capturing capacity are concisely prepared via a coordination‐directed one‐pot synthesis process to potentiate the immunogenicity of radiotherapy. The obtained CS‐Mn microparticles that undergo rapid disassembly under physiological conditions can selectively bind with DNA to form positively charged DNA‐CS assemblies because of the strong electrostatic interaction between linear chitosan and DNA molecules. They thus enable efficient cytosolic delivery of DNA in the presence of serum to cooperate with Mn2+ to activate the cGAS‐STING pathway in dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral injection, the CS‐Mn microparticles markedly enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy against both irradiated and distal tumors in different tumor models via collectively promoting tumor‐infiltrating CD8+ T‐cell stemness and the activation of innate immunity. The radiosensitization effect of CS‐Mn microparticles can be further augmented by concurrently applying anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 (anti‐PD‐1) immunotherapy. This work highlights an ingenious strategy to prepare Trojan horse‐like DNA‐capturing microparticles as cGAS‐STING‐activating radiosensitizers for effective radioimmunotherapy.

A novel Ga2O3 solar‐blind photodetector with a vertically stratified crystalline structure and VO concentration is designed to spatially separate the carrier's generation and transport channels in the device, thus achieving excellent responsivity and response speed simultaneously.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) emerges as a promising solar‐blind photodetector (SBPD) material if the “Response Speed (RS) dilemma” can be resolved. Devices with spatially segregated carrier generation and transport channels offer a potential solution but remain less available. This work introduces a novel thermal pulse treatment (TPT) method to achieve a vertically stratified crystalline structure and oxygen vacancies (VO) throughout the Ga2O3 film, validated through extensive characterizations. Technology Computer‐Aided Design (TCAD) simulations corroborated the critical role of VO stratification in enhancing the responsivity (Rλ) and response speed simultaneously. Consequently, the TPT‐processed SBPD exhibited exceptional performance, boasting a maximum  Rλ of 312.6 A W−1 and a faster decay time of 40 µs, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding SBPD chips show significant potential for applications in solar‐blind imaging, light trajectory tracking, and solar‐blind power meters. This work thus provides a viable strategy to address the “RS dilemma” common in most wide‐bandgap materials, showcasing excellent application value.

<title>Perturbing Organelle‐Level K+/Ca2+ Homeostasis by Nanotherapeutics for Enhancing Ion‐Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ion‐mediated immunotherapy agent (IMIA) is engineered to achieve precise spatiotemporal control of perturbing K+/Ca2+ homeostasis at the organelle‐level, which can effectively evoke tumor‐associated immunogenicity, thereby stimulating the activation of DCs and potentiating the infiltration of tumor‐specific cytotoxic T cells to achieve high‐performance cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Intracellular ions are involved in numerous pivotal immune processes, but the precise regulation of these signaling ions to achieve innovative immune therapeutic strategies is still a huge challenge. Here, an ion‐mediated immunotherapy agent (IMIA) is engineered to achieve precise spatiotemporal control of perturbing K+/Ca2+ homeostasis at the organelle‐level, thereby amplifying antitumor immune responses to achieve high‐performance cancer therapy. By taking in intracellular K+ and supplying exogenous Ca2+ within tumor cells, K+/Ca2+ homeostasis is perturbed by IMIA. In parallel, perturbing K+ homeostasis induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers the release of Ca2+ from ER and causes a decreased concentration of Ca2+ in ER, which further accelerates ER‐mitochondria Ca2+ flux and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (store‐operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE)) via opening Ca2+ release‐activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, thus creating a self‐amplifying ion interference loop to perturb K+/Ca2+ homeostasis. In this process, the elevated immunogenicity of tumor cells would evoke robust antitumor immune responses by driving the excretion of damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Importantly, this ion‐immunotherapy strategy reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and awakens the systemic immune response and long‐term immune memory effect, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of primary/distant tumors, orthotopic tumors as well as metastatic tumors in different mice models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The practical application of aqueous Zn‐I2 batteries is seriously restricted by their low energy density and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a temperature‐insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax‐bacterial cellulose / p(AM‐co‐VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) is designed to realize an energy‐dense Zn‐I2 battery with cascade I0/I−, I+/I0, and Br0/Br− redox couples over a widen temperature range from −50 to 50 °C.








Abstract
The practical development of aqueous zinc‐iodine (Zn‐I2) batteries is greatly hindered by the low energy density resulting from conventional I0/I− conversion and the limited temperature tolerance. Here, a temperature‐insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax‐bacterial cellulose / p(AM‐co‐VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) for achieving an energy‐dense cascade aqueous Zn‐I2 battery over a wide temperature range from −50 to 50 °C is designed. A comprehensive investigation, combining advanced spectroscopic investigation and DFT calculations, has revealed that the presence of Br species in the gel electrolyte facilitates the conversion reaction of Br0/Br−. Simultaneously, it activates the high voltage I+/I0 redox reaction through interhalogen formation. Consequently, sequential and highly reversible redox reactions involving I0/I−, I+/I0, and Br0/Br− are achieved with the assistance of −NR3+ units in BAVBr, effectively suppressing interhalogen hydrolysis in aqueous electrolyte. The cascade reactions lead to a high area capacity of 0.76 mAh cm−2 at a low I2 loading of 1 mg cm−2 or 760 mAh g−1 based on the mass of iodine, demonstrating exceptional long‐term cycling stability over a wide temperature range from −50 to 50 °C. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of electrolytes for high‐energy aqueous batteries, specifically tailored for wide‐temperature operation.

<title>A PD‐L1 siRNA‐Loaded Boron Nanoparticle for Targeted Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A PD‐L1 siRNA‐loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD‐L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD‐L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD‐L1 inhibits intracellular PD‐L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT‐induced DNA damage but also maximizing T‐cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT‐immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B‐containing polymer that self‐assembled with PD‐L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD‐L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT‐immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD‐L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD‐L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T‐cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT‐induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD‐L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

The unique structure of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) offers excellent electrical, mechanical properties, and surface area, enhancing their use in flexible thermoelectric materials. This review highlights recent advances in CNT‐based thermoelectrics, focusing on doping, composites, stability improvement, and applications in wearable devices, while addressing current challenges and future directions for optimization.








Abstract

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A comprehensive system‐level neural network‐assisted end‐to‐end design framework of meta‐optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual‐polarization multi‐wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi‐wavelength‐depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non‐orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized‐spectral multi‐information processing.








Abstract
Meta‐optics, with unique light‐matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi‐parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano‐structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high‐performance full‐light field control. Here, a neural network‐assisted end‐to‐end design framework that facilitates global, gradient‐based optimization of multifunctional meta‐optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi‐wavelength‐polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., ≈6 × structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full‐parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri‐polarization multi‐wavelength‐depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non‐orthogonal polarizations (>3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized‐spectral multi‐information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta‐optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next‐generation intelligent optical technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
MXenes are delaminated in a green organic solvent to achieve large flake size and polymer compatibility. PVDF composites are produced through non‐solvent‐induced phase separation to tune the structure and properties of thin‐film dielectric capacitors. MXenes with both mixed and pure chlorine terminations enhance the dielectric properties of PVDF, reaching energy density above 45 J cm−3 and 95% efficiency.








Abstract
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a semicrystalline polymer used in thin‐film dielectric capacitors because of its inherently high dielectric constant and low loss tangent. Its dielectric constant can be increased by the formation and alignment of its β‐phase crystalline structure, which can be facilitated by 2D nanofillers. 2D carbides and nitrides, MXenes, are promising candidates due to their notable dielectric permittivity and ability to increase interfacial polarization. Still, their mixing is challenging due to weak interfacial interactions and poor dispersibility of MXenes in PVDF. This work explores a novel method for delaminating Ti3C2Tx MXene directly into organic solvents while maintaining flake size and quality, as well as the use of a non‐solvent‐induced phase separation method for producing both dense and porous PVDF‐MXene composite films. A deeper understanding of dielectric behavior in these composites is reached by examining MXenes with both mixed and pure chlorine terminations in PVDF matrices. Thin‐film capacitors fabricated from these composites display ultrahigh discharge energy density, exceeding 45 J cm−3 with 95% efficiency. The PVDF‐MXene composites are also processed using a green and sustainable solvent, propylene carbonate.

<title>Self‐Manipulating Sodium Ion Gradient‐Based Endogenic Electrical Stimulation Dressing for Wound Repair</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419149?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419149?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self‐manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non‐invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self‐manipulating sodium ion gradient‐based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig‐EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non‐invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig‐EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig‐EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+‐ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig‐EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury‐associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig‐EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in‐sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire‐induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two‐order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization‐based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in‐sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In‐sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in‐sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric‐reconfigurable polarization‐sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in‐sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non‐volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state‐of‐the‐art polarization‐sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road‐scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

<title>Molecular Trojan Based on Membrane‐Mimicking Conjugated Electrolyte for Stimuli‐Responsive Drug Release</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multifunctional “Trojan” molecule based on membrane‐mimicking and zwitterionic conjugated electrolyte is developed for advanced drug delivery systems. By integrating into and rigidifying lipid bilayer structures, it prevents premature payload leakage and enables reliable in vivo visualization of carriers. Upon remote 808 nm excitation, this light‐responsive molecule triggers rapid drug release at tumor sites, inducing synergistic multimodal therapies.








Abstract
Enhancing payload encapsulation stability while enabling controlled drug release are both critical objectives in drug delivery systems but are challenging to reconcile. This study introduces a zwitterionic conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecule named Zwit, which acts as a molecular Trojan by mimicking the lipid bilayers. When integrated into liposome membranes, Zwit rigidifies the bilayer structure likely due to its hydrophobic interactions providing structural support, thus inhibiting drug leakage. Upon 808 nm laser excitation, Zwit rapidly accelerates DOX release from liposome core, likely due to light‐triggered conformational changes or photothermal effects that compromise membrane permeability. These findings demonstrate Zwit’s ability to overcome the challenge of simultaneously preventing premature payload leakage and enabling stimuli‐responsive drug release with a single component. Additionally, Zwit exhibits excellent biocompatibility with membranes, outperforming its quaternary ammonium counterpart and commonly used dye indocyanine green (ICG). By harnessing its NIR‐II emission, Zwit enables durable in vivo biodistribution tracking of nanocarriers, whereas ICG suffers from significant dye leakage. In subcutaneous tumor models, the synergistic effects of chemotherapy and thermotherapy facilitated by this light‐triggered system induced a potent antitumor immune response, further enhancing anticancer efficacy. This work underscores the potential of membrane‐mimicking CEs as multifunctional tools in advanced drug delivery systems.

<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202416427?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A universal thick anode composed of polymer and carbon nanotubes has been developed, demonstrating stable operation across 15 simple‐ion and 3 complex‐ion systems. It achieves exceptional cycle life in supercapacitors, ultrahigh areal capacities in batteries, and high compatibility with seawater electrolytes. With ultrahigh‐loading capability (100 mg cm⁻2) and cost‐effectiveness, this thick electrode is promising for practical aqueous (seawater) energy devices.









Abstract
Aqueous and seawater energy storage devices hold great potential for electrical grids application due to safety, affordability, and sustainability. However, their broader deployment has been constrained by the absence of a durable thick anode. Here, the first universal thick anode operating stably across 15 simple‐ion and 3 complex‐ion systems, including nonmetallic (H+, NH4
+), monovalent (Li+, Na+, K+), multivalent ions (Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+), and seawater ions (>5 cations) is reported. Composed of polymer nanosheets and carbon nanotubes, this anode supports thick electrode fabrication (e.g., 100 mg cm−2 and 1 mm) with low porosity/tortuosity, superior electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness, and chemical stability. Consequently, it achieves exceptionable cycle life (up to 380 000 cycles) in supercapacitors and ultrahigh areal capacities (6.5 mAh cm−2) in batteries, even under practical/extreme conditions, attributed to the formation of a water‐scarce, cation‐rich electrical double‐layer structure, as revealed by simulations. Compatible with sea salt‐based electrolytes and paired with a metal‐free cathode, the anode enables seawater batteries with thousands‐cycle life and high energy/power density. Of universal ion storage, ultrahigh‐loading capability, unlimited resources, and cost‐effectiveness, this polymer electrode is promising for practical aqueous (seawater) energy devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance‐area product by integrating chemically vapor‐deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin‐orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy‐efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high‐performance spintronics but also paves the way for next‐generation low‐power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin‐orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field‐free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT‐memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor‐deposited two‐dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non‐volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect, achieving a low resistance‐area product (RA) of 15.5 kΩ·µm2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low‐power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti‐parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT‐memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT‐memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT‐memory with PMA field‐free switching.

<title>Glucose Metabolism‐Targeted Poly(amino acid) Nanoformulation of Oxaliplatin(IV)‐Aspirin Prodrug for Enhanced Chemo‐Immunotherapy</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419033?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419033?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A glucose metabolism‐targeted nanoformulation (NP/OXA‐ASP2) is designed to inhibit lactate efflux while inducing mitochondrial stress to boost immunogenic cell death, thus synergistically reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by decreasing the proportion of immunosuppressive cells (Tregs and MDSCs) and increasing the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and plays an enhanced efficacy of chemo‐immunotherapy to colon cancer.








Abstract
Inappropriate glucose metabolism in cancer cells is associated with immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Although glycolysis inhibition enhances T cell‐mediated immune responses, the integrated platforms combining glycolysis inhibition with immunotherapy remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, a glucose metabolism‐targeted poly(amino acid) nanoformulation of oxaliplatin(IV)‐aspirin prodrug (NP/OXA‐ASP2) is developed to improve chemo‐immunotherapy by suppressing tumor glycolysis. This poly(amino acid) nanoparticle exhibits selective release, discharging 90.0% of OXA‐ASP2 under reductive conditions within 36 h. Furthermore, over 80% of the prodrug converts to OXA and ASP within 12 h, promoting mitochondrial damage and glycolysis inhibition, which amplifies immunogenic cell death induced by OXA. In addition, suppressing glycolytic flux reduces lactate leakage, mitigating the immunosuppressive TMEs. Together, these mechanisms contribute to stronger chemo‐immunotherapy efficacy. Compared to the OXA plus ASP formulation, NP/OXA‐ASP2 demonstrates superior performances, reducing lactate levels at the tumor site by 25.4%, increasing the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by 1.53 times, decreasing the proportion of regulatory T cells by 2.20 times, and improving 1.39‐fold of the tumor inhibition rate. These findings underscore that NP/OXA‐ASP2 is a promising platform for integrating tumor metabolic regulation with immunomodulation and holds significant potential for advancing clinical chemo‐immunotherapy.

<title>Tumor‐Targeted Glutamine Metabolism Blocker Synergizes with TiO2‐Au Janus Nanoparticles for Enhanced Sono‐Metabolic Antitumor Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sono‐metabolic nano‐composites (TiO2‐Au@DON) produce huge amounts of ROS (type I and type II) under ultrasound irradiation, effectively inducing immunogenic cell death via TiO2‐Au‐induced‐SDT phenomena. The released DON disrupts NADPH and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT‐mediated oxidative stress, offering a precise combination of SDT and immunotherapy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising therapeutic modality known for its non‐invasiveness, temporal‐spatial controllability, and deeper tissue penetration. However, the SDT treatment efficacy is still hampered by the scarcity of ideal sonosensitizers and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these challenges, a sono‐metabolic nano‐composite (TiO2‐Au@DON) using the metabolic reprogramming prodrugs of 6‐Diazo‐5‐oxo‐l‐norleucine (DON) grafted on TiO2‐Au Janus nanoparticles (NPs) is fabricated. The coupling of TiO2 and gold in the TiO2‐Au@DON effectively prevents the fast recombination of excited electrons and holes under ultrasound irradiation. The result is the generation of higher levels of both type I and II reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to pure TiO2, which helps overcome the limitations of SDT in the hypoxic TME. Furthermore, the TiO2‐Au Janus NPs act as nano‐carriers, delivering DON prodrugs to the tumor site. The released DON can disrupt nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming the metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT‐mediated oxidative stress, resulting in the increase of tumor sensitivity to ROS through TiO2‐Au@DON‐integrated synergistic effects of SDT and glutamine reprogramming strategies. This increased sensitivity ultimately induces robust immunogenic cell death (ICD), enhancing antitumor therapeutic efficacy and remodeling the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment.

Abstract
Micromachines capable of performing diverse mechanical tasks in complex and constrained microenvironments are of great interest. Despite important milestones in this pursuit, until now, micromachines are confined to actuation within a single 2D plane due to the challenges of transferring motion across different planes in limited space. Here, a breakthrough method is presented to overcome this limitation: multi‐component micromachines that facilitate 3D motion transfer across different planes. These light‐driven 3D micromachines, fabricated using standard photolithography combined with direct laser writing, are assembled and actuated via programmable light patterns within an optoelectronic tweezers system. Utilizing charge‐induced repulsion and dielectrophoretic levitation effects, the micromachines enable highly efficient mechanical rotation and effective inter‐component motion transfer.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well‐ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long‐term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer‐by‐layer self‐assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl‐binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high‐affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of ≈140 and ≈40, respectively, while maintaining long‐term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high‐performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

A universal strategy to enhance the performance and mechanical stability of flexible perovskite near‐infrared (NIR) photodetector arrays is demonstrated through a combination of self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) bridging interface and stress release of nano‐array structure, presenting the maximum response wavelength of 1050 nm, a responsivity of 1.66 A W−1, detectivity of 6.19 × 1012 Jones, high fidelity imaging, and extra‐long environmental stability.








Abstract
Perovskite photodetectors with superior optoelectronic properties, lightweight, and compatibility with flexible substrates have attracted much attention in wearable electronics. However, the large bandgap, inherent brittleness, poor environmental stability, and weak interfacial adhesion interaction between perovskites and substrates hinder the application of near‐infrared (NIR) wearable devices. Herein, a universal strategy to enhance the performance and mechanical stability of flexible perovskite NIR photodetector arrays is demonstrated through a combination of mussel‐inspired self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) bridging interface and precise modulation of the nano‐array size, which enables to significantly increase interfacial adhesion, crystallinity, crystallographic orientation, and reduce mechanical stresses of perovskite single‐crystal arrays. Moreover, inserting paddle‐wheel metal–organic cluster ligands lead to an unprecedented small bandgap of 1.04 eV, enhanced lattice rigidity, and environmental stability for 2D perovskite. The flexible perovskite NIR photodetector arrays with superior mechanical robustness and record NIR performance are revealed with a maximum response wavelength of 1050 nm, a responsivity of 1.66 A W−1, detectivity of 6.19 × 1012 Jones, high fidelity imaging, and extra‐long environmental stability. This work pioneers a new insight into the integration of high‐performance and mechanically durable perovskite flexible wearable devices.

Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy‐efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86–1.32 g g−1 at 15–30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 °C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19 kg kg−1 day−1 by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.

The defective blood glucose regulation ability of diabetic patients leading to bacterial infection, cellular oxidative stress, and vascular damage results in delayed healing of chronic diabetic wounds. Here, a glucose‐activated self‐switching enzyme‐like activity programmed hydrogel is proposed to provide self‐regulated timely intelligent insulin release affected by blood glucose fluctuations, thereby forming feedback blood glucose management and exerting a full‐stage wound healing. The hydrogel is composed of Au─MoS2─phenylboronic acid nanozyme and insulin‐loaded nitroimidazole‐modified sodium alginate hypoxia‐sensitive microcapsules and penylboronic‐acid‐modified chitosan. It utilizes glucose as a sacrificial agent to generate antibacterial reactive oxygen species by recognizing the hyperglycemia environment, and releasing insulin for blood glucose regulation for up to 12 h with the help of the enzyme‐like catalysis‐generated hypoxia environment. In a normoglycemia environment, the hydrogel switches the enzyme‐like activity to supply oxygen, inhibiting further insulin release. The hydrogel achieves ≈3 times the wound recovery rate of commercial dressings through blood glucose regulation and improved wound microenvironment. The hydrogel has been proven to significantly improve the healing of chronic diabetic wounds by regulating the body's blood glucose homeostasis and implementing a staged healing treatment plan, providing a powerful solution for diabetic wound care.

<title>Synergistic Integration of Halide Perovskite and Rare‐Earth Ions toward Photonics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a comprehensive review of the synergistic integration of halide perovskite and rare‐earth ions toward photonics including structural features, optical properties, preparation methods, and photonic applications. Critical challenges and perspectives are introduced. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for perovskite and rare‐earth composites and their intriguing future application scenario.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs), emerging as a noteworthy class of semiconductors, hold great promise for an array of optoelectronic applications, including anti‐counterfeiting, light‐emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and photodetectors, primarily due to their large absorption cross section, high fluorescence efficiency, tunable emission spectrum within the visible region, and high tolerance for lattice defects, as well as their adaptability for solution‐based fabrication processes. Unlike luminescent HPs with band‐edge emission, trivalent rare‐earth (RE) ions typically emit low‐energy light through intra‐4f optical transitions, characterized by narrow emission spectra and long emission lifetimes. When fused, the cooperative interactions between HPs and REs endow the resulting binary composites not only with optoelectronic properties inherited from their parent materials but also introduce new attributes unattainable by either component alone. This review begins with the fundamental optoelectronic characteristics of HPs and REs, followed by a particular focus on the impact of REs on the electronic structures of HPs and the associated energy transfer processes. The advanced synthesis methods utilized to prepare HPs, RE‐doped compounds, and their binary composites are overviewed. Furthermore, potential applications are summarized across diverse domains, including high‐fidelity anticounterfeiting, bioimaging, LEDs, photovoltaics, photodetection, and photocatalysis, and conclude with remaining challenges and future research prospects.

Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80 cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

A material‐device‐algorithm co‐design strategy integrates an OFET array with in‐sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e‐noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material‐device‐algorithm co‐design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field‐effect transistor (OFET) array with in‐sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k‐nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs—among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e‐noses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial‐scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post‐treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high‐value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA‐K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high‐performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403 mA cm⁻2 at 1.40 V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA‐K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA‐K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial‐scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320 g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H₂, yielding 1200 g of AA‐K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.

<title>Atomically Engineered Trimetallic Nanoclusters Toward Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photoinitiation Activity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The central doping of Pd/Pt atoms and the surface‐motif doping of Cd atoms are concurrently achieved in trimetallic MAu18Cd3 (M = Pd/Pt) nanoclusters, which are synthesized via using the M‐doped Au25 template. This co‐doping strategy can significantly enhance the photoluminescence intensity and efficiency by affecting radiative relaxation and nonradiative relaxation pathways simultaneously.









Abstract
Precise doping is of vital significance for atomic engineering and the establishment of structure‐property relationships in nanocluster (NC) chemistry. Herein, two novel trimetallic MAu18Cd3 (M = Pd/Pt) NCs that are derived from M‐doped Au25 templates of MAu24 are reported, in which the central doping of M atom and the surface‐motif doping of Cd atoms are concurrently achieved. Compared to the original templates, Cd‐induced surface engineering enhances the rigidity of the structural framework and enlarges the HOMO‐LUMO gaps of the MAu18Cd3, significantly improving photoluminescent efficiency by suppressing nonradiative relaxation. The critical role of the central M (Pd/Pt) dopant in photoluminescence, which regulates the rate of radiative decay of excited‐state electrons, has also been substantiated. More notably, the doped case of PtAu18Cd3 exhibits excellent photoinitiation activity in 3D two‐photon printing with a high resolution of ≈140 nm, which may be attributed to the prolonged excited state. Overall, this work provides a generalized routine for the precise synthesis of multi‐metal NCs with concurrent enhancements in photoluminescence and photoinitiation activity, which is expected to stimulate further research for the design and preparation of multi‐functional, multi‐metal NCs.

<title>Triazine‐containing Covalent Organic Polymer‐derived Grid‐Like Multilocular Spheres for Aqueous Supercapacitors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A grid‐like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist‐induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). It enables the as‐assembled supercapacitor with an ultra‐high energy density of 675 Wh kg−1 in KI‐mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine‐containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid‐like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist‐induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as‐fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and enables the as‐assembled supercapacitor with an ultra‐high energy density of 675 Wh kg−1 in redox‐active electrolyte (KI‐mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro‐activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox‐active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application‐inspired cutting‐edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

<title>Rapid and Large‐Scale Synthesis of High‐Crystalline Imide Covalent Organic Frameworks Accelerated by Self‐Generated Water</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419515?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low‐cost self‐accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent‐free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self‐healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self‐accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low‐cost, and large‐scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent‐free, vacuum‐free, and low‐temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self‐accelerated synthesis is driven by the self‐generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self‐healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o‐substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol‐functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as‐prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self‐accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low‐cost, and large‐scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The strategy of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signaling provides an emerging strategy for anti‐infective treatment. Here, the MOF nanocatalytic system induces a strong antibacterial response by triggering redox homeostasis imbalance in both of the bacteria and neutrophils, and initiate neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment.








Abstract
Strategies of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signals have revolutionized therapeutics involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, certain diseases with dual resistance barriers to the attacks by both ROS and immune cells, such as bacterial biofilm infections of medical implants, are difficult to eradicate by a single exogenous oxidative stimulus due to the diversity and complexity of the redox species involved. Here, this work demonstrates that metal‐organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles capable of disrupting the bacterial ROS‐defense system can dismantle bacterial redox resistance and induce potent antimicrobial immune responses in a mouse model of surgical implant infection by simultaneously modulating redox homeostasis and initiating neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment. Mechanistically, the piezoelectrically enhanced MOF triggers ROS production by tilting the band structure and acts synergistically with the aurintricarboxylic acid loaded within the MOF, which inhibits the activity of the cystathionine γ‐cleaving enzyme. This leads to biofilm structure disruption and antigen exposure through homeostatic imbalance and synergistic activation of neutrophil N1 polarization signals. Thus, this study provides an alternative but promising strategy for the treatment of antibiotic‐resistant biofilm infections.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using a prototypal platform of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymer–MOF hybrid sorbents, an optimal combination of surface hydrophobicity and strong electrostatics enables “parts per billion” removal of per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with record‐high kinetics and efficient sorbent regeneration. The expendable nature of guest‐accessible porosity for PFAS removal is established, underpinning a counterintuitive perspective on future adsorbent design.








Abstract
The confluence of pervasiveness, bioaccumulation, and toxicity in freshwater contaminants presents an environmental threat second to none. Exemplifying this trifecta, per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) present an alarming hazard among the emerging contaminants. State‐of‐the‐art PFAS adsorbents used in drinking water treatment, namely, activated carbons and ion‐exchange resins, are handicapped by low adsorption capacity, competitive adsorption, and/or slow kinetics. To overcome these shortcomings, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored pore size, surface, and pore chemistry are promising alternatives. Thanks to the compositional modularity of MOFs and polymer–MOF composites, herein we report on a series of water‐stable zirconium carboxylate MOFs and their low‐cost polymer‐grafted composites as C8–PFAS adsorbents with benchmark kinetics and “parts per billion” removal efficiencies. Bespoke insights into the structure–function relationships of PFAS adsorbents are obtained by leveraging interfacial design principles on solid sorbents, creating a synergy between the extrinsic particle surfaces and intrinsic molecular building blocks.

<title>Orbital Current Pumping From Ultrafast Light‐driven Antiferromagnetic Insulator</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator α‐Fe2O3 via terahertz emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. This phenomenon occurs when the magnonic orbital moment of the antiferromagnetic insulator α‐Fe2O3 is excited by the ultrafast laser, resulting in the pumping of orbital current into Pt/CuOx interface. 








Abstract
The orbital Hall effect originating from light materials with weak spin‐orbit coupling, has attracted considerable interest in spintronic applications. Recent studies demonstrate that orbital currents can be generated from charge currents through the orbital Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials. However, the generation of orbital currents in antiferromagnets has so far been elusive. In this work, this is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator α‐Fe2O3 via terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. A significant increase in THz signal is obtained in α‐Fe2O3/Pt/CuOx heterostructure compared to that of α‐Fe2O3/Pt, with the maximum value occurring at a Pt thickness of 2 nm. The enhancement of the THz signal is attributed to the fact that magnons injected into Pt excite a coupled spin‐orbital current that flows toward the Pt/CuOx interface, aside from the spin‐to‐charge conversion in the Pt layer. The magnetoresistance contains the conventional spin‐Hall magnetoresistance contributed by the Pt layer and an additional orbital contribution from the Pt/CuOx interface. The Pt/CuOx interface generates an orbital current and absorbs the orbital accumulation, similar to the orbital‐Hall magnetoresistance. This finding provides a rich platform for orbital‐to‐charge conversion and opens an interdisciplinary field of antiferromagnetic orbitronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on deterministic characteristics in the structuring of materials via additive manufacturing, crystals can be grown in an active and interactive manner, which realizes spatiotemporal programming and reprogramming of crystals. In the present study, snowflake‐like camphor crystals are demonstrated with their real‐time seeding and reprogramming via in situ, localized photopolymerization of mixture systems, which launches an era of active crystallization.









Abstract
Additive manufacturing has sought active and interactive means of creating predictable structures with diverse materials. Compared to such active manufacturing tools, current crystallization strategies remain in statistical and passive programs of crystals via macroscale thermodynamic controllers, commonly lacking active means to intervene in crystal growth in a spatiotemporal manner. Herein, a strategy toward active and interactive programming and reprogramming of crystals, realized by real‐time tangible feedback on growing crystals by delicately controlling the degree of in‐situ, localized photopolymerization of polymeric structures via additive manufacturing is presented. Using this strategy, crystals can be seeded, guided, and even reprogrammed in a supersaturated liquid resin. In principle, the localized formation of sparse polymeric networks within supercooled resins can induce density fluctuation to trigger seed nucleation instantaneously, whereas the formation of dense networks can lower molecules’ mobilities to inhibit crystal growth. Assisted by these active triggers and deterministic procedural aspects in additive manufacturing, growing crystals can be tangibly interacted through programmed polymeric structures, strengthening deterministic characteristics in crystal growth. It is suggested that crystal growth can be programmable with deterministic hierarchies within the created crystal's morphologies within the background of inherent stochasticity in crystallization, launching an era of convolutional growth of crystals.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Perovskite quantum dots with efficient scintillating luminescence are incorporated in glass fibers with low‐loss waveguiding, enabling remote, real‐time radiation detection. More importantly, the scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array with controlled thickness and length for use in remote pixilated X‐ray imaging.








Abstract
The emerging metal halide perovskites are challenging the traditional scintillators in the field of radiation detection and radiography. However, they lack the capability for remote and real‐time radiation monitoring and imaging in confined and hostile conditions. To address this issue, details on an inorganic scintillating glass fiber incorporating perovskite quantum dots (QDs) as highly efficient pixelated radiation emitters are reported, while the glass fibers themselves serve at the same time as low‐loss waveguides, enabling long‐distance and underwater X‐ray detection. The multi‐color emissions and controllable radiation sensitivities endow CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) QD scintillating glass fibers with the potential as wearable and visualized radiation indicators. Furthermore, these scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array plate with a thickness of 7.5 mm to enhance X‐ray absorption for X‐ray imaging. Leveraging the light‐guiding character of glass fibers, a 5 × 5 fiber array with fiber lengths up to 11 cm has demonstrated the potential of remote pixelated X‐ray imaging. This study offers a novel platform for the development of remote detectors and imagers for X‐ray radiation.

A novel unidirectional freeze‐casting method fabricates a Poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)‐facilitated, vertically aligned MXene aerogel, enhancing chemoresistive sensing performance. The structure maximizes surface area, forms interfacial heterostructures, and modulates electron mobility, achieving high sensitivity, broad detection range, and stability. Biocompatible and flexible, the sensor functions as a reliable alcohol breathalyzer and skin‐mountable device for chemical sensing.








Abstract
MXene has garnered growing interest in the field of electrochemistry, thanks to its unique electrical and surface characteristics. Nonetheless, significant challenges persist in realizing its full potential in chemoresistive sensing applications. In this study, a novel unidirectional freeze‐casting approach for fabricating a Poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)‐facilitated vertically aligned MXene‐based aerogel with enhanced chemoresistive sensing properties was introduced. Firstly, the persistent challenge of poor gelation in MXene was addressed by formulating a nanohybrid of MXene and PEDOT:PSS, which acted as flexible conductive nanobinder. Employing a unique freeze‐casting method, MXene flakes interconnected by PEDOT:PSS, were stabilized into a flexible, vertically aligned structure, leading to maximum surface exposure and enhanced robustness. The resulting 3‐dimentional (3‐D) aerogel exhibited a fast, heightened chemoresistive response of 7 to 50 parts per million (ppm) acetone and expanded the working range to between 10 parts per billion (ppb)‐8000 ppm. Interfacial heterostructures formed between MXene and PEDOT:PSS, provided active sites, reduced activation energy, and enhanced selectivity. Modulated MXene bandgap, and its electron mobility further facilitated electron transfer, and enhanced signal strength. The sensor showed excellent biocompatibility and was also successfully employed as a breathalyzing tool, for on‐demand alcohol consumption monitoring.

<title>Low Thermal Conductivity and Diffusivity at High Temperatures Using Stable High‐Entropy Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Low thermal diffusivity at high temperature (800 °C) is achieved using packed nanoparticles of high‐entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations with low thermal conductivity and relatively high packing density of ≈50 %. The high entropy leads to remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures, thus enabling the low thermal conductivity of the packed nanoparticles.








Abstract
The realization of low thermal conductivity at high temperatures (0.11 W m−1 K−1 800 °C) in ambient air in a porous solid thermal insulation material, using stable packed nanoparticles of high‐entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations (HESO‐8 NPs) with a relatively high packing density of ≈50%, is reported. The high‐density HESO‐8 NP pellets possess around 1000‐fold lower thermal diffusivity than that of air, resulting in much slower heat propagation when subjected to a transient heat flux. The low thermal conductivity and diffusivity are realized by suppressing all three modes of heat transfer, namely solid conduction, gas conduction, and thermal radiation, via stable nanoconstriction and infrared‐absorbing nature of the HESO‐8 NPs, which are enabled by remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures due to the high entropy. This work can elucidate the design of the next‐generation high‐temperature thermal insulation materials using high‐entropy ceramic nanostructures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Eight chemiluminescence (CL) probes with a malononitrile group are easily synthesized by introducing donors to regulate HClO‐activated CL emissions from 600 to 750 nm, with comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations supporting a concerted decomposition of the oxidized CL molecule, achieving high‐contrast imaging of acute inflammation in vivo with a high signal‐to‐background ratio (SBR) of 24.77.









Abstract
Chemiluminescence (CL) imaging has emerged as a powerful approach to molecular imaging that allows exceptional sensitivity with virtually no background interference because of its unique capacity to emit photons without an external excitation source. Despite its high potential, the application of this nascent technique faces challenges because the current chemiluminescent agents have limited reactive sites, require complex synthesis, are insufficiently bright, and lack near‐infrared emission. Herein, a series of HClO‐activated chemiluminescent probes that exhibit robust near‐infrared emission are studied. Specifically engineered to respond to HClO, a known biomarker of acute inflammation, these probes achieve high‐contrast in vivo imaging by eliminating the need for constant external excitation. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the CL of the probes depends on the reactivity of the vinylene bonds, following a concerted decomposition of the oxidized chemiluminescent molecule. The application of these chemiluminescent nanoparticles in vivo facilitates high‐contrast imaging of acute inflammation, providing real‐time, high‐contrast visualization of inflammatory conditions. This advancement signifies a leap forward for chemiluminescent nanoplatforms in biomedical imaging and expands the available methodologies in this field.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Wireless nanoelectrodes made of electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are anchored to the membrane of neural stem cells to enable their migration together with the cells and precise extracellular electrical stimulation to the membrane receptors under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode‐mediated electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of stem cells into specifical dopaminergic neurons and improves the repair of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. Neural‐stem‐cell (NSC)‐based therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of PD but its therapeutic performance is limited by low efficiency of differentiation of NSCs to dopaminergic neurons. Although electrical stimulation can promote neuronal differentiation, it is not verified whether it can induce the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons. Meanwhile, it is a great challenge to precisely apply electrical stimulation to dynamically migrating NSCs after transplantation. Here, electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are designed to anchor to the membrane of NSCs to serve as wireless nanoelectrodes. After anchoring to the cell membrane, these nanoelectrodes are able to migrate together with the cells and precisely apply extracellular electrical stimulation to the receptors or ion transport channels on the membrane of transplanted cells under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode‐mediated electrical stimulation induces 38.46% of the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons, while the percentage is only 5.82% for NSCs without the nanoelectrode stimulation. Transplantation of NSCs anchored with the nanoelectrodes effectively improves the recovery of the motor and memory ability of PD mice under alternating magnetic field within 2 weeks.

This study presents a mild strategy to synthesis of mild‐photothermal responsive and NO donor Prussian blue nanozymes for inflammation regulation and bacterial eradication in periodontal disease.








Abstract
Periodontitis, an infectious disease of periodontal tissues caused by oral bacterial biofilms, is characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and immune microenvironment imbalance. Multifunctional nanozymes, leveraging their physiochemical properties and enzymatic activities, offer promising antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory strategies for managing periodontitis. In particular, Prussian blue nanozymes (PBzymes) exhibit exceptional ROS control due to their robust catalytic activity, diverse antioxidant functions, and high biocompatibility. However, the practical application of traditional high‐temperature synthesis methods is limited. This study introduces a class of metal‐engineered PBzymes synthesized at room temperature, identified for their potent antioxidative activity and excellent photothermal performance at mild temperatures. Nitric oxide (NO) gas therapy offers promising strategies for targeting deep infections in periodontal tissues. Thus, sodium nitroprusside is introduced into PBzyme to create SPBzyme via an in situ loading method. NO release by SPBzyme enhances antibacterial effects and overcomes resistance linked to bacterial biofilms, resulting in mild‐photothermal antibacterial properties and synergistic antioxidant effects. In vitro antibacterial assays demonstrate the superior efficacy of SPBzyme under mild temperature conditions and near‐infrared light exposure. Furthermore, SPBzyme effectively reduces inflammation and has positive therapeutic effects in periodontal animal models. Overall, mild‐temperature photothermal NO release nanozyme therapy represents a novel approach for treating periodontitis.

Polyanionic electrolyte ionization functionalisation via layer‐by‐layer deposition as desalination strategy is implemented here to a localized thermal solar evaporator empowering continuous evaporation over extended periods of time and under real sweater from the Yellow Sea and from the East China Sea.








Abstract
Solar evaporation contributes to sustainable and environmentally friendly production of fresh water from seawater and wastewater. However, poor salt resistance and high degree of corrosion of traditional evaporators in brine make their implementation in real applications scarce. To overcome such deficiency, a polyanionic electrolyte functionalization strategy empowering excellent uniform desalination performance over extended periods of time is exploited. This 3D superhydrophilic graphene oxide solar evaporator design ensures stable water supply by the enhanced self‐driving liquid capillarity and absorption at the evaporation interface as well as efficient vapor diffusion. Meanwhile, the polyanionic electrolyte functionalization implemented via layer‐by‐layer static deposition of polystyrene sodium sulfonate effectively regulates/minimizes the flux of salt ions by exploiting the Donnan equilibrium effect, which eventually hinders local salt crystallization during long‐term operation. Stable evaporation rates in line with the literature of up to 1.68 kg m−2 h−1 are achieved for up to 10 days in brine (15‰ salinity) and for up to 3 days in seawater from Hangzhou Bay in the East China Sea (9‰ salinity); while, maintaining evaporation efficiencies of ≈90%. This work demonstrates the excellent benefits of polyanionic electrolyte functionalization as salt resistance strategy for the development of high‐performance solar powered seawater desalination technology and others.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A two‐terminal metaplastic resistive memory device is developed by combining graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with iron oxide (FeOx). This research contributes to the field of neuromorphic computing by providing a scalable and reconfigurable hardware solution that effectively integrates metaplasticity into artificial synaptic devices, addressing the problem of catastrophic forgetting in current neural network architectures.









Abstract
The limitations of deep neural networks in continuous learning stem from oversimplifying the complexities of biological neural circuits, often neglecting the dynamic balance between memory stability and learning plasticity. In this study, artificial synaptic devices enhanced with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) that exhibit metaplasticity is introduced, a higher‐order form of synaptic plasticity that facilitates the dynamic regulation of memory and learning processes similar to those observed in biological systems. The GQDs‐assisted devices utilize interface‐mediated modifications in asymmetric conductive pathways, replicating classical synaptic plasticity mechanisms. This allows for repeatable and linearly programmable adjustments to future weight changes linked to historical weights. Incorporating metaplasticity is essential for achieving generalization within deep neural networks, which enables them to adapt more fluidly to new information while retaining previously acquired knowledge. The GQDs‐device‐based system achieved a 97% accuracy on the fourth MNIST dataset task, while consistently achieving performance levels above 94% on prior tasks. This performance substantiates the feasibility of directly transferring metaplasticity principles to deep neural networks, thereby addressing the challenges associated with catastrophic forgetting. These findings present a promising hardware solution for developing neuromorphic systems with robust and sustained learning capabilities that can effectively bridge the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.

Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is characterized by fibrosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accelerated surrounding extracellular matrix catabolism. Bioactive hydrogels have shown significant potential in regulating cellular functions and tissue homeostasis. In this work, a dynamic hydrogel (HA‐NCSN/Cu) is designed via the reductive chelation of hyaluronic acid grafted with thiourea (HA‐NCSN) and Cu2+. The reductivity of the grafted thiourea groups of HA‐NCSN can quickly reduce part of the chelated Cu2+ to Cu+. Therefore, during the gelation process, the color of hydrogel become dark immediately, which endowed hydrogel with remarkable photothermal effect. The abundant thiourea groups inside hydrogel can effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species to mitigate the inflammatory stress of NP cells. RNA sequencing analysis further reveals that glutathione signaling pathway is significantly altered. Meanwhile, mild photothermal therapy could activate the TGF‐β/Smad pathway in NP cells, promoting the expression and secretion of Aggrecan and Collagen II. Ultimately, the combined modulation of inflammation alleviation and matrix regeneration achieves the restoration of the structure and function of the damaged intervertebral disc, which is also strongly demonstrated by the in vivo animal experiments. All of these results demonstrate the great potential of the dynamic HA‐NCSN/Cu hydrogel in IVDD treatment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An antigen‐adjuvant spatiotemporally‐synchronized multi‐epitope nanovaccine, termed as CM‐CpG‐aCD40, is constructed by conjugating the immune stimulative CpG oligonucleotide and the anti‐CD40 antibody (aCD40) onto the membrane vesicles derived from triple negative breast cancer cells. The nanovaccine improves the antibody‐secreting and antigen‐presenting abilities of B cells, providing a multi‐pronged approach to activation of antitumor immune responses.








Abstract
B lymphocytes have emerged as an important immune‐regulating target. Inoculation with tumor cell membrane‐derived vaccines is a promising strategy to activate B cells, yet their efficiency is limited due to lack of costimulatory molecules. To amplify B cell responses against tumor, herein, a spatiotemporally‐synchronized antigen‐adjuvant integrated nanovaccine, termed as CM‐CpG‐aCD40, is constructed by conjugating the immune stimulative CpG oligonucleotide and the anti‐CD40 antibody (aCD40) onto the membrane vesicles derived from triple negative breast cancer cells. CM‐CpG‐aCD40 actively accumulates in lymph nodes and is effectively captured by antigen‐presenting cells via the recognition of CD40 by aCD40. Tumor antigens on CM‐CpG‐aCD40 bind to B cell receptors, providing the first stimulation signal for B cells. Meanwhile, the interaction between CpG/Toll like receptor and aCD40/CD40 provides superposed co‐stimulation signals, improving the antibody‐secreting and antigen‐presenting abilities of B cells. The nanovaccine also stimulates dendritic cells to activate CD8+ T cells, and reprograms tumor associated macrophages. CM‐CpG‐aCD40 activating humoral, cellular, and innate antitumor immunity achieves a tumor inhibition rate of 89.3%, which is further improved to 95.4% when combined with the anti‐programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) antibody. CM‐CpG‐aCD40, as a personalized multi‐epitope nanovaccine, paves the way for ushering the era of B cell‐based immunotherapy.

<title>Multiple Polarization States in Hf1−xZrxO2 Thin Films by Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric Coupling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study demonstrates the three‐step domain switching characteristic in Hf1−xZrxO2 thin films with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric coupling, in the form of triple‐peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. By fully switching individual peaks in the triple‐peak EC distribution, the long‐sought reliable operation of 3‐bit per cell are realized in the Hf1−xZrxO2 films, including high endurance, small device‐to‐device variation, and long data retention.








Abstract
HfO2‐based multi‐bit ferroelectric memory combines non‐volatility, speed, and energy efficiency, rendering it a promising technology for massive data storage and processing. However, some challenges remain, notably polarization variation, high operation voltage, and poor endurance performance. Here we show Hf1−xZrxO2 (x = 0.65 to 0.75) thin films grown through sequential atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO2 and ZrO2 exhibiting three‐step domain switching characteristic in the form of triple‐peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. This long‐sought behavior shows nearly no changes even at up to 125 °C and after 1 × 108 electric field cycling. By combining the electrical characterizations and integrated differential phase‐contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC‐STEM), we reveal that the triple‐peak EC distribution is driven by the coupling of ferroelectric switching and reversible antiferroelectric–ferroelectric transition. We further demonstrate the 3‐bit per cell operation of the Hf1−xZrxO2 capacitors with excellent device‐to‐device variation and long data retention, by the full switching of individual peaks in the triple‐peak EC. The work represents a significant step in implementing reliable non‐volatile multi‐state ferroelectric devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A library of seed@high‐entropy‐alloy core–shell nanocrystals with up to ten elements and well‐defined facets are synthesized via seed‐mediated growth. Several facet‐dependent catalytic activities are identified in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, with active sites determined by in situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and density‐functional theory. This work advances facet engineering in a multi‐elemental scope and unveils the potential for catalysis.








Abstract
High‐entropy‐alloy (HEA) nanocrystals hold immense potential for catalysis, offering virtually unlimited alloy combinations through the inclusion of at least five constituent elements in varying ratios. However, general and effective strategies for synthesizing libraries of HEA nanocrystals with controlled surface atomic structures remain scarce. In this study, a transferable strategy for developing a library of facet‐controlled seed@HEA nanocrystals through seed‐mediated growth is presented. The synthesis of seed@HEA core–shell nanocrystals incorporating up to ten different metallic elements, with control over the number of solid‐solution HEA atomic layers is demonstrated. Epitaxial HEA growth on nanocrystal seeds with low‐index and high‐index facets leads to the formation of seed@HEA catalyst library with composition‐ and facet‐dependent catalytic activities in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In situ synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and density‐functional theory calculations are employed to identify surface active sites of the HEA, rationalizing the high level of catalytic activities achieved. This work enables facet engineering in the multi‐elemental chemical space and unveils the critical needs for their future development toward catalysis.

<title>Photoimmunologic Therapy of Stubborn Biofilm via Inhibiting Bacteria Revival and Preventing Reinfection</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411468?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411468?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An oligo‐ethylene glycol‐modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer is developed for photoimmunologic therapy of stubborn biofilm. It not only downregulates the two‐component system, quorum sensing, and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth, and accelerating wound healing but also triggers immunogenetic cell death to promote short‐term immune and long‐term immunological memory enhancement for coping with secondary infections.








Abstract
Stubborn biofilm infections pose serious threats to public health. Clinical practices highly rely on mechanical debridement and antibiotics, which often fail and lead to persistent and recurrent infections. The main culprits are 1) persistent bacteria reviving, colonizing, and rejuvenating biofilms, and 2) secondary pathogen exposure, particularly in individuals with chronic diseases. Addressing how to inhibit persistent bacteria revival and prevent reinfection simultaneously is still a major challenge. Herein, an oligo‐ethylene glycol‐modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer (PS), TBTCP‐PEG7, is developed. It effectively eradicates Methicillin‐Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) under light irradiation. Furthermore, TBTCP‐PEG7‐mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only conquers stubborn biofilm infections by downregulating the two‐component system (TCS), quorum sensing (QS), and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth and biofilm remodeling but also prevents reinfection by upregulating heat shock protein‐related genes to induce immunogenetic cell death (ICD) and establish immune memory. In vivo, TBTCP‐PEG7 efficiently eradicates MRSA biofilm adhered to medical catheters, stimulates angiogenesis, reduces inflammatory factor expression, and accelerates wound healing. Furthermore, ICD promotes short‐term immune and long‐term immunological memory for coping with secondary infections. This two‐pronged strategy not only effectively overcomes stubborn, persistent and recurrent biofilm infection, but also provides theoretical guidance for designing the next generation of antibacterial materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by the rapid regeneration of antlers, HAMA hydrogel as a carrier for incorporating EVsABPCs into antler‐DCB is utilized. Notably, the antler‐DCB@EVsABPCs showed a strong ability to recruit endogenous BMSCs and transformed them an ABPC‐like cells, thereby facilitating rapid bone formation. Additionally, the bone graft triggered bone growth coordinated with angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and immunomodulation, which partially imitating early phase antlerogenesis.








Abstract
Adult mammals are unable to regenerate bulky bone tissues, making large bone defects clinically challenging. Deer antler represents an exception to this rule, exhibiting the fastest bony growth in mammals, offering a unique opportunity to explore novel strategies for rapid bone regeneration. Here, a bone graft exploiting the biochemical, biophysical, and structural characteristics of antlers is constructed. It is decellularized antler cancellous bone (antler‐DCB) to obtain a bone scaffold. Then, an antler‐based bone graft is constructed by integrating antler‐DCB with antler‐derived biological signals, delivered by extracellular vesicles (EVs) from antler blastema progenitor cells (ABPCs), a novel stem cells responsible for antlerogenesis is discovered. The antler‐based bone graft transformed bone marrow stromal cells into cells with an ABPC‐like phenotype and transcriptomic signature. In vivo, the antler‐based graft triggered rapid bone formation in a rat model, with doubled volume of newly formed bones than commercial DCBs. In addition, the antler‐based graft orchestrated a coordinated process of vascularization, neurogenesis, and immunomodulation during osteogenesis, partially imitating early antlerogenesis. These findings provide practical insights to develop a therapeutic intervention for treating severe bone defects.

<title>Stabilizing Electron Transport of 2D Materials</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D materials are a potential candidate for beyond‐silicon electronics. However, the stability is one of the key bottlenecks in the progress of 2D materials. Here, a strategy is developed that greatly improves the performance and stability of 2D materials and devices by using vitamin C. The increase in mobility is more than ten times, and the performance can be maintained in air conditions for more than 327 days.








Abstract
2D materials are promising candidates for beyond‐Si electronic devices. However, their stability is a key bottleneck in their industrial applications. The instability of 2D materials is mainly attributed to their intrinsic susceptibility to O2 and H2O—particularly to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have strong oxidizing properties. Inspired by the antioxidant effect of vitamin C (VC) in organisms, a strategy based on the use of VC to stabilize electron transport in 2D materials is developed, which significantly improves the performance and stability of these materials and devices. The mobility is increased by more than an order of magnitude, and excellent performance of the device is maintained in air for >327 days, which is the best reported stability for MoS2 field‐effect transistors to date. VC scavenges existing ROS via oxidation reactions and inhibits the generation of ROS by shielding excitons from oxygen quenching, which provides 2D materials lasting protection from electron trapping and oxidative damage, stabilizing electron transport. This approach, which is based on the simple utilization of readily available VC, has considerable potential for large‐scale applications in the 2D material electronics industry.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Adenosine triphosphate‐tagged pro‐proteins are engineered to form stable nanocomplexes with guanidyl‐rich, α‐helical polypeptide and enable robust cytosolic delivery. By delivering ribonucleoprotein, this system induces pronounced genome editing against hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α after intravitreal injection, inhibiting neovascularization and subretinal fibrosis in choroidal neovascularization mice.









Abstract
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP)‐based CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing holds great potential for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which however, is challenged by the lack of efficient cytosolic protein delivery tools. Herein, reversibly‐phosphorylated pro‐proteins (P‐proteins) with conjugated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) tags are engineered and coupled with a membrane‐penetrating, guanidine‐enriched, α‐helical polypeptide (LGP) to mediate robust and universal cytosolic delivery. LGP forms salt‐stable nanocomplexes (NCs) with P‐proteins via electrostatic interaction and salt bridging, and the helix‐assisted, strong membrane activities of LGP enabled efficient cellular internalization and endolysosomal escape of NCs. Therefore, this approach allows efficient cytosolic delivery of a wide range of protein cargoes and maintains their bioactivities due to endolysosomal acidity‐triggered traceless restoration of P‐proteins. Notably, intravitreally delivered LGP/P‐RNP NCs targeting hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) induce pronounced gene disruption to downregulate pro‐angiogenic factors and alleviate subretinal fibrosis, ultimately provoking robust therapeutic efficacy in CNV mice. Such a facile and versatile platform provides a powerful tool for cytosolic protein delivery and genome editing, and it holds promising potential for the treatment of CNV‐associated diseases, such as age‐related macular degeneration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ionic diode‐based drug delivery system is demonstrated, which uses electric potential for spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained drug release with minimal leakage. It provides flow‐free drug delivery at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. In a tumor‐bearing mouse model, it shows superior anti‐tumor efficacy and reduced off‐target immune toxicity compared to intratumoral drug injection.








Abstract
Drug delivery systems hold promise for delivering cytotoxic drugs by controlling the timing and location of the drug release. However, conventional delivery mechanisms often fall short of achieving spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained release, which is crucial for ensuring drug efficacy and minimizing impact on surrounding tissues. Here, an ionic diode‐based drug delivery system is reported that is controlled by an electric potential and capable of releasing drugs at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. The migrated drug is slowly but continuously diffused to the lesion through the hydrogel at the desired rate. The ionic diode provides flow‐free drug delivery while minimizing unintended drug leakage over prolonged periods. Implanted in a freely moving tumor‐bearing mouse model, the system filled with doxorubicin demonstrated superior anti‐tumor efficacy and minimal off‐target immune toxicity compared to the intratumoral injection of free doxorubicin. With its mechanically compliant and biocompatible components, the system offers a safe and readily translatable approach to patients with surgically unresectable tumors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The non‐equilibrium microwave‐powered liquid metal depolymerization is proposed for converting various polyolefin wastes into high‐value olefin monomers and narrowband hydrocarbon oils by introducing. By leveraging the self‐separation feature of liquid metals and their exceptional chemical‐bond activation ability under microwave field, an unprecedented high turnover frequency of 2.83 kgPlastic mLLiquid metal−1 is achieved.








Abstract
Upcycling waste plastics is highly promising to tackle global white pollution while achieving sustainable development. However, prevailing approaches often encounter challenges in scalable engineering practices due to either insufficient plastic upcycling capability or arduousness in the separation, recovery, and purification of catalysts, which inevitably augments the cost of plastic upcycling. Here, the microwave‐powered liquid metal synergetic depolymerization is presented to facilitate low‐cost plastic upcycling. By leveraging the fluidity of liquid metals and their exceptional chemical‐bond activation ability under microwave field, this method efficiently converts various polyolefins into narrowband hydrocarbon oil (Oil yield: 81 wt.% for polypropylene (PP), 85.9 wt.% for polyethylene (PE)) and high‐value olefin monomers (C2‐4 selectivity: 50% for PE, 65.3% for PP) over 30 successive cycles, resulting in a high turnover frequency of 2.83 kgPlastic mLLiquid metal−1. These captivating advantages offered by electromagnetically‐powered liquid metals are also supported by their self‐separation features, thereby paving the way for large‐scale engineering solutions in waste plastic upcycling.

<title>Toward Long‐Life High‐Voltage Aqueous Li‐Ion Batteries: from Solvation Chemistry to Solid‐Electrolyte‐Interphase Layer Optimization Against Electron Tunneling Effect</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel acetamide‐based eutectic electrolyte with enhanced solvation chemistry design, combined with a widened operation voltage range to induce hydrogen evolution reaction, forms a robust solid‐electrolyte‐interphase layer, mitigating electron tunneling and significantly improving the cycle stability of high‐voltage aqueous Li‐ion batteries.








Abstract
Water is pursued as an electrolyte solvent for its non‐flammable nature compared to traditional organic solvents, yet its narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) limits its performance. Solvation chemistry design is widely adopted as the key to suppress the reactivity of water, thereby expanding the ESW. In this study, an acetamide‐based ternary eutectic electrolyte achieved an ESW ranging from 1.4 to 5.1 V. The electrolyte confines water molecules within the primary solvation sheath of Li‐ions, reducing the free water and breaking the hydrogen bond network. Despite this, initial capacity retention is suboptimal due to inadequate formation of solid‐electrolyte‐interphase (SEI) layers. To address this, additional hydrogen evolution reaction is induced by widening the operation voltage range, thereby optimizing the SEI layer to mitigate the electron tunneling effect. This approach resulted in a denser LiF‐rich SEI layer, effectively preventing water decomposition and improving long‐term cycle stability. The optimized SEI layer reduced the electron tunneling barrier, achieving a discharge capacity of 152 mAh g−1 at 1 C and maintaining 76% of its capacity (116 mAh g−1) after 1000 cycles. This study highlights the critical role of both solvation structure and SEI layer optimization in enhancing the performance of high‐voltage aqueous Li‐ion batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A vascularized patient‐derived tumor organoid (PDTO)‐on‐a‐chip with a hierarchical, tumor‐specific microvasculature is developed, enabling high‐resolution, real‐time visualization of dynamic interactions within the tumor's perivascular niche. This platform effectively models tumor‐driven angiogenesis and migration, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for assessing metastatic risk and guiding clinical strategies.








Abstract
While tumor organoids have revolutionized cancer research by recapitulating the cellular architecture and behaviors of real tumors in vitro, their lack of functional vasculature hinders their attainment of full physiological capabilities. Current efforts to vascularize organoids are struggling to achieve well‐defined vascular networks, mimicking the intricate hierarchy observed in vivo, which restricts the physiological relevance particularly for studying tumor progression and response to therapies targeting the tumor vasculature. An innovative vascularized patient‐derived tumor organoids (PDTOs)‐on‐a‐chip with hierarchical, tumor‐specific microvasculature is presented, providing a versatile platform to explore tumor‐vascular dynamics and antivascular drug efficacy. It is found that highly metastatic tumor cells induced vessel angiogenesis and simultaneously migrated toward blood vessels via the Notch pathway. The evident association between the angiogenic and migratory capacities of PDTOs and their clinical metastatic outcomes underscores the potential of the innovative platform for evaluating tumor metastasis, thus offering valuable insights for clinical decision‐making. Ultimately, the system represents a promising avenue for advancing the understanding of tumor metastasis and developing personalized treatment strategies based on patient‐specific tumor characteristics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A method of electrochemical pulsing which forms a spinel‐like δ phase in Mn‐rich disordered rocksalt materials with Li‐excess (DRX) (DRX) cathode materials is demonstrated. This concept is extended to large single‐crystalline particles, greatly improving the cycling stability. X‐ray diffraction, scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) and atomic resolution STEM‐HAADF were used to reveal a nanodomain spinel structure separated by antiphase boundaries.









Abstract
Mn‐rich disordered rocksalt materials with Li‐excess (DRX) materials have emerged as a promising class of earth‐abundant and energy‐dense next‐generation cathode materials for lithium‐ion batteries. Recently, an electrochemical transformation to a spinel‐like “δ” phase has been reported in Mn‐rich DRX materials, with improved capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability compared with previous DRX compositions. However, this transformation unfolds slowly over the course of cycling, complicating the development and understanding of these materials. In this work, it is reported that the transformation of Mn‐rich DRX materials to the promising δ phase can be promoted to occur much more rapidly by electrochemical pulsing at elevated temperature, rate, and voltage. To extend this concept, micron‐sized single‐crystal DRX particles are also transformed to the δ phase by the same method, possessing greatly improved cycling stability in the first demonstration of cycling for large, single‐crystal DRX particles. To shed light on the formation and specific structure of the δ phase, X‐ray diffraction, scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) and atomic resolution STEM‐HAADF are used to reveal a nanodomain spinel structure with minimal remnant disorder.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented, achieved through structural design of a non‐stretching material and over‐electrodeposition of PEDOT:PSS. sMEA enables tight contact with organoids despite exposure to buoyant force in medium, resulting in electrophysiological signals with a high signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR). High SNR signals allow for non‐invasive functional assessment of the organoids for drug screening.








Abstract
Organoids are 3D biological models that recapitulate the complex structures and functions of human organs. Despite the rapid growth in the generation of organoids, in vitro assay tools are still limited to 2D forms. Thus, a comprehensive and continuous functional evaluation of the electrogenic organoids remains a challenge. Here, a highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented for functional evaluation of electrogenic organoids. The optimized serpentine structures with bridge structures cover the surface of the organoids conformally even in immersion. The protruding microelectrodes form a stable contact with the organoids and allow electrophysiological recordings with high signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR). sMEAs are fabricated in wafer‐scale for repeatable, scalable, and mass production and packed into an easy‐to‐use, user‐friendly, and robust microwell for fast dissemination of technology. The versatility of sMEA is validated by measuring electrophysiological signals from cardiac spheroids and midbrain organoids with a wide range of sizes from 500 to 1500 µm. Also, electrophysiological signals recorded with high SNR enable functional evaluation of the effects of drugs. The proposed sMEA with high SNR and user‐friendly interface could be the key player in high‐throughput drug screening, 3D spatiotemporal mapping of electrogenic organoids, and standardization of protocols for quality assessment.

<title>Noble‐Metal‐Free Cocatalysts Reinforcing Hole Consumption for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Ultrahigh Apparent Quantum Efficiency</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202412965?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202412965?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, a novel strategy is proposed that reinforces hole consumption to boost the oxidation half‐reaction and ultimately the photocatalytic H2 production. This is achieved by the rational design of noble‐metal‐free cocatalysts as efficient oxidative sites, promoting the generation of sacrificial agents (CH3O−). Such a strategy can achieve a record apparent quantum efficiency of up to 65.8%.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and sustainable hydrogen production through photocatalysis is highly promising yet remains a significant challenge, especially when replacing costly noble metals with more abundant alternatives. Conversion efficiency with noble‐metal‐free alternatives is frequently limited by high charge recombination rates, mainly due to the sluggish transfer and inefficient consumption of photo‐generated holes. To address these challenges, a rational design of noble‐metal‐free cocatalysts as oxidative sites is reported to facilitate hole consumption, leading to markedly increased H2 yield rates without relying on expensive noble metals. By integrating femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, the rapid hole consumption is compellingly confirmed, which in turn promotes the effective separation and migration of photo‐generated carriers. The optimized catalyst delivers an impressive photocatalytic H2 yield rate of 57.84 mmol gcat−1 h−1, coupled with an ultrahigh apparent quantum efficiency reaching up to 65.8%. Additionally, a flow‐type quartz microreactor is assembled using the optimal catalyst thin film, which achieves a notable H2 yield efficiency of 0.102 mL min−1 and maintains high stability over 1260 min of continuous operation. The strategy of reinforcing hole consumption through noble‐metal‐free cocatalysts establishes a promising pathway for scalable and economically viable solar H2 production.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel strategy for developing self‐adaptive zwitterionic polysilazane coatings with excellent mechanical robustness and broad‐spectrum antiadhesion properties is proposed. The developed coatings exhibits excellent wear resistance, good flexibility, strong adhesion, and high transparency as well as anti‐biofouling, anti‐liquid adhesion, and anti‐scaling properties. They have potential applications in marine industries, optical devices, pipeline transportation, and other fields.








Abstract
Antiadhesive coatings have been extensively studied owing to their wide applications in biology, environment, and energy. However, developing a mechanically robust coating with broad‐spectrum antiadhesion properties remains challenging. Herein, a novel strategy for preparing hard yet flexible and self‐adaptive zwitterionic polysilazane coatings with broad‐spectrum antiadhesion properties (anti‐biofouling, anti‐liquid adhesion, and anti‐scaling) is proposed. The coatings are prepared by combining polysilazane with a telomer (FT) consisting of a low‐surface‐energy fluorine motif and hydrolysis‐induced zwitterions. Before Si─OH generation in polysilazane, the fluorine motif drives the zwitterionic precursor to enrich on the surface, generating a zwitterionic layer following pre‐hydrolysis. This unique design prevents the coatings from swelling in water, allowing them to adapt to diverse environments. The fluorine motif can orient toward the surface of air, providing anti‐liquid adhesion capabilities, whereas the zwitterions orient underwater to endow anti‐biofouling, anti‐liquid adhesion, and anti‐scaling capabilities. The highly cross‐linked network toughened by FT contributes to the high hardness (up to 7H) and good flexibility of the coating. The chemical bonding between the coating and substrates ensures their strong adhesion (≈2.06–7.67 MPa). This study contributes to the design of mechanically robust broad‐spectrum antiadhesive coatings applicable in marine industries, optical devices, pipeline transportation, and other fields.

<title>Popularizing Holistic High‐Index Crystal Plane via Nonepitaxial Electrodeposition Toward Hydrogen‐Embrittlement‐Relieved Zn Anode</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Optimized electrodeposition dynamics help mitigate severe hydrodynamic fluctuations and hydrogen embrittlement issues, which not only refines the Zn deposition quality but also cultivates high‐index Zn (112) texture, rendering durable Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Electrodeposition is promising to fabricate Zn electrodes affording nonepitaxial single‐crystal textures. Previous research endeavors focus on achieving Zn(002) faceted deposition, nevertheless, the popularization of a high‐index Zn plane with favorable electrochemical activity remains poorly explored. There also exists a deficiency in the assessment of the electrodeposited quality of Zn. Here, a straightforward strategy to address such concerns by cultivating predominant Zn(112) texture via a potentiostatic electrodeposition mode is reported. By precisely identifying the “limiting” conditions for electrodeposition, a striking balance between improved deposition quality, tailored deposition kinetics, and suppressed hydrogen evolution is found. (002) Faceted Zn electrode is shown that be indeed produced, yet the rampant hydrodynamic convection and hydrogen embrittlement issue under such “over‐limiting” preparation conditions pose challenges in the electrode lifespan. In contrast, an optimized deposition minimizes hydrodynamic disturbances and mitigates the hydrogen embrittlement effect, where the thus‐generated high‐index (112)‐textured Zn electrode manifests impressive deposition quality and demonstrates holistic cycling stability. The pouch cell by pairing a ZnxV2O5 (ZnVO) cathode manages a reversible capacity of ≈130 mAh and a capacity retention of 98.42%. This study offers guidance for the development of dendrite‐free and hydrogen‐embrittlement‐relieved Zn anodes, unleashing the potential of high‐index plane textures for advanced Zn batteries.

<title>An NIR‐II Two‐Photon Excitable AIE Photosensitizer for Precise and Efficient Treatment of Orthotopic Small‐Size Glioblastoma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Precise and efficient treatment of orthotopic small‐size glioblastoma is realized in this work by fully taking advantage of two‐photon excitation and an aggregation‐induced emission photosensitizer. The proposed photosensitizer with a large two‐photon absorption cross‐section, the second near‐infrared excitation, the first near‐infrared emission, and prominent ROS generation, contributes to remarkable tumor growth inhibition and an ultra‐deep imaging depth in the brain.








Abstract
The existence of residual small‐size tumors after surgery is a major factor contributing to the high recurrence rate of glioblastoma (GBM). Conventional adjuvant therapeutics involving both chemotherapy and radiotherapy usually exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy and severe side effects. Recently, two‐photon photodynamic therapy (TP‐PDT), especially excited by the second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) light, offers an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge, attributed to its combinational merits of PDT and TP excitation. However, this attempt has not been explored yet. On the other hand, the lack of high‐performance photosensitizers (PSs) also hinders the progress of TP‐PDT on GBM. Based on those, a robust TP‐PS, termed MeTTh, is constructed intendedly through elaborately integrating multiple beneficial design strategies into a single molecule, which simultaneously achieves excellent NIR‐II excitation, large absorption cross‐section, aggregation‐induced NIR‐I emission, and prominent Type I/II reactive oxygen species generation. Aided by nanofabrication, an impressive brain structure imaging depth of 940 µm is realized. Moreover, MeTTh nanoparticles smoothly implement precise and efficient treatment of small‐size GBM in vivo under a 1040 nm femtosecond laser irradiation. This study represents first‐in‐class using TP‐PDT on GBM, offering new insights for the therapy of small‐size tumors in complex and vital tissues.

<title>Intrinsic Localized Excitons in MoSe2/CrSBr Heterostructure</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413438?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413438?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study indentifies localized excitons confined by substrate defects in the MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructure, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of intrinsic defects in modulating excitonic properties. Distinctive proximity‐induced behaviors, including opposite valley polarization evolutions of MoSe2 excitons and novel in‐plane anisotropic emissions, are reported. This work deepens the understanding of spectrally resolved proximity effects in magnetic van der Waals heterostructures.








Abstract
Despite extensive studies on magnetic proximity effects, the fundamental excitonic properties of the 2D semiconductor‐magnet heterostructures remain elusive. Here, the presence of localized excitons in MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructures is unveiled, represented by a new photoluminescence emission feature, X*. Our findings reveal that X* originates from excitons confined by intrinsic defects in the CrSBr layer. Additionally, the degrees of valley polarization of the X* and trion peaks exhibit opposite polarities under a magnetic field and closely correlate with the magnetic order of CrSBr. This is attributed to spin‐dependent charge transfer across the heterointerface, supported by density functional theory calculations which reveal a type‐II band alignment. Furthermore, the strong in‐plane anisotropy of CrSBr induces unique polarization‐dependent responses in MoSe2 emissions. This study highlights the crucial role of defects in shaping excitonic properties and offers valuable insights into spectrally resolved proximity effects in semiconductor‐magnet van der Waals heterostructures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thin film Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) on roll‐to‐roll gravure printing cylinders offers superior conductive ink transfer to flexible substrates compared to chrome. It enables fine lines and intricate structures for flexible electronics and security applications. DLC supports high‐volume production of flexible microelectronics and micro‐scale battery components, providing a more sustainable alternative to rigid electronics and reducing the carbon footprint.








Abstract
Diamond‐Like Carbon (DLC), a thin‐film material, is emerging as a promising alternative for durable surfaces due to its eco‐friendly application process. This study evaluated the use of thin‐film DLC on the wafer surface of gravure cylinders for roll‐to‐roll printing of fine‐line electrodes and microtext patterns, specifically for applications in flexible electronics and graphics security. Results suggested that using thin film DLC on the wafer surface allows reliable reproduction of isometric grids and line structures with widths of 15, 20, and 30 µm, as well as solid electrodes. The uniform conformity of thin‐film DLC on the wafer surface, featuring an engraved micron‐size cell structure, demonstrates superior ink transfer onto flexible PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrates. This results in increased electrode line width and reduced electrical resistance compared to chrome. Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability and repeatability of the findings. Visual analysis of lines and microtext also demonstrated the reliable print‐reproducing capabilities of DLC‐coated surfaces. Overall, these results suggest that thin‐film DLC is a promising alternative for use as a protective layer on gravure wafer surfaces. It has the potential to produce high‐quality, high‐volume electronics, such as sensors, antennas, and batteries, for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other sustainable technologies.

<title>Field‐Induced Polarization Rotation in Order–Disorder (K,Na)NbO3‐Based Ferroelectrics</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413587?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A combination of advanced structural characterization at local and average scales and theoretical calculations reveals that the macroscopic rhombohedral‐tetragonal phase coexistence of (K,Na)NbO3‐based piezoceramics is essentially an average projection of collective local disordered units exhibiting the order‐disorder behavior. The field‐induced polarization rotation with a change in the degree of ordering is found to play a key role in boosting the functional properties of the investigated ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Phase boundary is highly recognized for its capability in engineering various physical properties of ferroelectrics. Here, field‐induced polarization rotation is reported in a high‐performance (K, Na)NbO3‐based ferroelectric system at the rhombohedral‐tetragonal phase boundary. First, the lattice structure is examined from both macroscopic and local scales, implementing Rietveld refinement and pair distribution function analysis, respectively. The macroscopic phase coexistence at the phase boundary can be interchangeably rationalized with an average projection of collective local disordered units, exhibiting the order–disorder nature. The structural evidence of field‐induced polarization rotation is provided by the in situ synchrotron study. Theoretical studies including density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation also predict the polarization rotation mechanism. The simulation result reveals the variation of the degree of ordering during the polarization rotation as a key feature of the boosted electrical properties in the order–disorder ferroelectric system. The discovery provides meaningful insight into the design of ferroelectrics with enhanced physical properties.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By utilizing anthracene and metalloporphyrin as the active components for the activation of oxygen and the catalysis of intramolecular cross‐oxidation coupling reaction, respectively, a series of photosensitive and stable tandem heterogeneous COF catalysts are constructed for realizing the efficient photosynthesis of 4‐quinazolinones. Particularly, TAPP‐Cu‐An enables one‐step, gram‐scale photosynthesis of 4‐quinazolinones in a short time and under mild conditions.








Abstract
The dehydrogenative cross‐coupling reaction is the premier route for synthesizing important 4‐quinazolinone drugs. However, it usually requires high reaction temperature and long reaction time, and the yield of the final product is low. Here two stable and photosensitive covalent‐organic frameworks (COFs), TAPP‐An and TAPP‐Cu‐An are purposefully designed and constructed to serve as unprecedented heterogeneous tandem catalysts to complete dehydrogenative cross‐coupling reactions in a short time and under mild reaction conditions (room temperature and light), leading to the high‐efficient photosynthesis of 4‐quinazolinones. Particularly, TAPP‐Cu‐An is the best heterogeneous catalyst currently available for the synthesis of 4‐quinazolinones, even surpassing all the catalysts reported so far. It also enables one‐step photosynthesis of 4‐quinazolinones with higher conversion (>99%) and selectivity (>99%) in a shorter time, and the product can be easily prepared on a gram scale. Extensive experiments combined with theoretical calculations show that the excellent photogenerated charge separation and transport capability, as well as the synergistic An‐Cu catalysis in TAPP‐Cu‐An are the main driving forces for this efficient reaction.

<title>Coordination Regulation Enabling Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Fast‐Charging High‐Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A sulfonate‐based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) composed of prop‐1‐ene‐1,3‐sultone (PES) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) without additional additives is developed. The unique Li+−PES−TFSI− coordination structure in the DEE facilitates rapid ion transport. Meanwhile, the strengthened α−H···F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thereby enabling the cycle stability of high‐capacity and high‐voltage cathode materials in lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The safety and cycle stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) under conditions of high cut‐off voltage and fast charging put forward higher requirements for electrolytes. Here, a sulfonate‐based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) resulting from the eutectic effect between solid sultone and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide without any other additives is reported. The intermolecular coordination effect triggers this eutectic phenomenon, as evidenced with nuclear magnetic resonance, and thus the electrochemical behavior of the DEE can be controlled by jointly regulating the coordination effects of F···H and Li···O intermolecular interactions. The DEE with a properly coordinated environment of Li+ presents a low motion barrier and a high transport rate of localized Li+, leading to a 10 C fast‐charging LiFePO4||Li battery with a capacity retention of 95.1% after 500 cycles. Meanwhile, the strengthened α−H···F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thus enabling the cycle stability of high‐capacity and high‐voltage cathode materials in LMBs, e.g., a cycle stability at 4.5 V in the LiNi0.88Co0.07Mn0.05O2||Li battery with a capacity retention of 81.0% after 500 cycles, and an excellent compatibility in 4.5 V LiCoO2||Li and 4.8 V Li1.13Mn0.517Ni0.256Co0.097O2||Li batteries. The practical applicability of the carefully designed DEE is underscored through successful implementation in pouch cells.

<title>Introducing La into a Customized Dual Cu Covalent Organic Framework to Steer CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity from C2H4 to CH4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Customized multi‐metal sites within covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a versatile platform for optimizing catalytic performance by precisely tuning metal composition based on their inherent properties. Specifically, the incorporation of oxophilic rare‐earth La into the dual Cu COF steers CO2 electroreduction selectivity from C2H4 to CH4, which realizes the directional regulation of catalytic products.








Abstract
Customizing multi‐metal site catalysts for achieving controllable CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) product tuning holds immense promise yet poses formidable challenges. The traditional synthesis method of multi‐metal sites is the pyrolysis of metal‐containing precursors, which is inherently uncontrollable. Herein, a bottom‐up strategy is employed to customize and synthesize multi‐metal sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs), aiming to controllably switch the CO2 reduction selectivity by regulating the electronic structure of active sites. Briefly, La element provides chances for manipulating and finetuning the electronic structure of the customized dual Cu sites, and converts the main catalytic product of CO2RR from ethylene to methane. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of La alters the electronic structure around Cu, enhances CO2 and H2O activation, and changes the formation of energy barriers of key intermediates. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study constructed the first example of customized multi‐metal site COF catalysts and provided new ideas for controllable modulation of products.

The repaired LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 by direct recycling technology shows an unsatisfactory cycle life. Local lattice stress is introduced into the regenerated cathode during repair. The resulting stress gradient leads to the localization of the phonon mode and changes the phonon dispersion relation of materials, inhibits TM atoms migration and the formation of defect structures. The regenerated cathode exhibits good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Direct recycling technology can effectively solve the environmental pollution and resource waste problems caused by spent lithium‐ion batteries. However, the repaired LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) black mass by direct recycling technology shows an unsatisfactory cycle life, which is attributed to the formation of spinel/rock salt phases and rotational stacking faults caused by the in‐plane and out‐of‐plane migration of transition metal (TM) atoms during charge/discharge. Herein, local lattice stress is introduced into the regenerated cathode during repair. The resulting stress gradient leads to the localization of the phonon mode and changes the phonon dispersion relation of materials, lowers the bending and stretching vibration frequencies of the TM─O covalent bond in cathode materials, and inhibits the TM atoms migration and the formation of defect structures. Beneficial from the favorable low‐frequency phonon dispersion relation, the regenerated NCM represents remarkably enhanced structural stability during cycling, and exhibits good electrochemical performance. This reconstructed phonon dispersion relation approach broadens the perspective for lattice stress field engineering to suppress the defective structure raised from TM migration and paves the way for the development of regenerated cathodes with long durability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A highly modulated interlayer spacing is observed for the first time in the epitaxial 2D spirals with electron correlations. Scalable synthesis of the epitaxial TaS2 spirals is achieved with customized CVD reactions. An intertwined CDW‐Mott state appears at room‐temperature in the epitaxial 1T‐TaS2 spirals, offering a platform to study collective properties at high temperatures.








Abstract

Tantalum disulfide (1T‐TaS2), being a Mott insulator with strong electron correlation, is highlighted for diverse collective quantum states in the 2D lattice, including charge density wave (CDW), spin liquid, and unconventional superconductivity. The Mott physics embedded in the 2D triangular CDW lattice has raised debates on stacking‐dependent properties because interlayer interactions are sensitive to van der Waals (vdW) spacing. However, control of interlayer distance remains a challenge. Here, spiral lattices in the epitaxial TaS2 spirals are studied to probe collective properties with tunable interlayer interactions. A scalable synthesis of epitaxial TaS2 spirals is presented. A more than 50%‐increased interlayer spacing enables prototype decoupled monolayers for enhanced electronic correlation exhibiting Mott physics at room‐temperature and a simplified system to explore collective properties in vdW materials.

A homo‐spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is reported that expanded to realize multisignal no‐spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission (4 times) via 3D vertical integration of four sensors. Moreover, HMPTs is used for the acquisition of 3D material information and the complete reconstruction of material information in VR.








Abstract
The spatiotemporal error caused by planar tiled structure design and the waste of communication resources brought on by the transmission of a single channel are two challenges facing the development of multifunctional intelligent sensors with high‐density integration. A homo‐spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is expanded to realize multisignal no‐spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission. First, this system optimizes the distribution of multifunctional sensors, completes the 3D vertical heterogeneous layout of four sensors, and achieves material multi‐information detection at a single place with no‐spatiotemporal deviation. Additionally, the system couples and transmittes multiple sensory signals, delivering a fourfold increase in transmission efficiency and one‐third of the power consumption compared to a single‐channel transmission system. Finally, this system is used for the recognition of mixed materials, and human‐computer interaction to realize the assignment of materials in VR, demonstrating the great accuracy and transmission efficiency of HMPTs as well as its feasibility in practical application. This is an a priori effort to enhance machine perception accuracy, improve signal transmission effectiveness, and advance human‐machine‐object triadic integration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel hydrogel bioadhesive taking the structural advantage of phenylalanine derivative for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions is reported. The hydrogel adhesive can not only realize fast hemostasis and accelerated tissue/organ injuries healing in vivo but also can be assembled as bioelectronics for precise and long‐term health monitoring under humid environments.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives with adequate wet adhesion and swelling resistance are urgently needed in clinic. However, the presence of blood or body fluid usually weakens the interfacial bonding strength, and even leads to adhesion failure. Herein, profiting from the unique coupling structure of carboxylic and phenyl groups in one component (N‐acryloyl phenylalanine) for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions, a novel hydrogel adhesive (PAAS) is developed with superior tissue adhesion properties and matrix swelling resistance in challenging wet conditions (adhesion strength of 85 kPa, interfacial toughness of 450 J m−2, burst pressure of 514 mmHg, and swelling ratio of <4%). The PAAS hydrogel can not only realize fast hemostasis of liver, heart, artery rupture, and sealing of pulmonary air‐leakage but also accelerate the recovery of stomach and liver defects in rat, rabbit, and pig models. Moreover, PAAS hydrogel can precisely and durably monitor various physiological activities (pulse, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram) even under humid environments (immersion in water for 3 days), and can be employed for the evaluation of in vivo sealing efficiency for artery rupture. The work provides a promising hydrogel adhesive for clinical hemostasis, tissue injury repair, and bioelectronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a novel synthetic approach to multicomponent MOFs by “standing on the shoulder of” a well‐established one based on the new understanding on the self‐assembly process. By making use of various chemical interactions during the self‐assembly process, the structural transformation can be modulated from ternary 3D structures to quaternary 2D structures.








Abstract
Multicomponent MOFs have offered a wide range of opportunities to harness new properties. However, the synthesis of multicomponent MOFs remains challenging. This work demonstrates the synthesis of a family of multicomponent MOFs by topological transformation from well‐established multicomponent partitioned acs (pacs) structures. Such transformation is based on the new understanding on the self‐assembly process of pacs MOFs. A key to this understanding is that pacs structures, topologically regarded as the introduction of a pore‐partitioning ligand into MOF‐235/MIL‐88 type framework, are likely to be formed in a layer‐pillar‐layer fashion in practical reactions. As the π–π interaction between layers and other chemical interactions during the self‐assembly process are recognized, the structural transformation can be modulated from 3D pacs structures to 2D interrupted pacs structures (denoted i‐pacs). It is especially noteworthy that such dimensional reduction is first observed in metal‐organic frameworks and the i‐pacs MOFs contain four structural modules and up to five components, which have the highest complexity among 2D MOFs. Interestingly, the i‐pacs MOFs have significantly enhanced performance for CO2/N2 separation in comparison with pacs MOFs.

<title>Boosting Anionic Redox Reactions of Li‐Rich Cathodes through Lattice Oxygen and Li‐Ion Kinetics Modulation in Working All‐Solid‐State Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The reversibility and activity of anionic redox reactions in lithium‐rich manganese‐based oxides (LRMOs) for all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) are significantly enhanced by the simultaneous incorporation of high‐binding energy B─O bonds and high‐efficiency LBO ionic networks into LRMO. This results in the formation of a robust LRMO‐LBO interwoven structure, which stabilizes the layered structure and LRMO|solid electrolyte interface, thereby contributing to superior long‐term cycling stability in ASSBs.








Abstract
The use of lithium‐rich manganese‐based oxides (LRMOs) as the cathode in all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) holds great potential for realizing high energy density over 600 Wh kg−1. However, their implementation is significantly hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior reversibility of anionic redox reactions of oxygen in ASSBs. In this contribution, boron ions (B3+) doping and 3D Li2B4O7 (LBO) ionic networks construction are synchronously introduced into LRMO materials (LBO‐LRMO) by mechanochemical and subsequent thermally driven diffusion method. Owing to the high binding energy of B─O and high‐efficiency ionic networks of nanoscale LBO complex in cathode materials, the as‐prepared LBO‐LRMO displays highly reversible and activated anionic redox reactions in ASSBs. The designed LBO‐LRMO interwoven structure enables robust phase and LBO‐LRMO|solid electrolyte interface stability during cycling (over 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1.0 C with a voltage range of 2.2–4.7 V vs Li/Li+). This contribution affords a fundamental understanding of the anionic redox reactions for LRMO in ASSBs and offers an effective strategy to realize highly activated and reversible oxygen redox reactions in LRMO‐based ASSBs.

A novel phototransistor is introduced by leveraging the unique optoelectronic properties of two low‐dimensional materials. The architecture enhances image perception and restoration quality, providing a robust solution for complex scenarios in machine vision. This innovative method facilitates the precise restoration of damaged images, offering significant potential for future advancements in sensor computing.








Abstract
Traditional imaging systems struggle in weak or complex lighting environments due to their fixed spectral responses, resulting in spectral mismatches and degraded image quality. To address these challenges, a bioinspired adaptive broadband image sensor is developed. This innovative sensor leverages a meticulously designed type‐I heterojunction alignment of 0D perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) and 2D black phosphorus (BP). This configuration enables efficient carrier injection control and advanced computing capabilities within an integrated phototransistor array. The sensor's unique responses to both visible and infrared (IR) light facilitate selective enhancement and precise feature extraction under varying lighting conditions. Furthermore, it supports real‐time convolution and image restoration within a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) network, effectively countering image degradation by capturing spectral features. Remarkably, the hardware responsivity weights perform comparably to software‐trained weights, achieving an image restoration accuracy of over 85%. This approach offers a robust and versatile solution for machine vision applications that demand precise and adaptive imaging in dynamic lighting environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large‐scale polar flux‐closure array from typical c/a domains are observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 bilayers, which is reversible after the removal of external electric fields. Phase‐field simulations demonstrate that the decrease of electrostatic energy is a main driving force in the transition of a/c to flux‐closures.








Abstract
Polar topologies show great potentials in memories and other nano‐micro devices. To integrate with silicon conducting circuits, it is vital to understand the dynamic evolution and the transformation of different domain configurations under external stimulus. Here in situ transmission electron microscopy is performed and the electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large‐scale polar flux‐closure array from typical c/a domains in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 bilayers is directly observed. It is found that the transformation is reversible after removal of external electric fields. Increasing external electric fields on (PbTiO3/SrTiO3)5 multilayered films, it is further found that the flux‐closure domains are nucleated and propagated via the steps of first the formation of new c domains and then connection with neighboring c domains. The transition from a/c domains to flux‐closure arrays under electric fields is collaborated with evaluating energy variations by phase‐field simulations in which the electrostatic energy plays an important role. These results demonstrate the polar topologies can be reversibly manipulated by external stimuli, which sheds light on further understanding the dynamics behavior of polar topologies and helps for future nanoelectric applications.

<title>Beyond Fundamental Building Blocks: Plasticity in Structurally Complex Crystals</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414376?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414376?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study explores how the deformation behavior of intermetallics can be linked through their crystal's building blocks. By examining samarium‐cobalt phases, it is found that their plasticity is not directly inherited from building blocks but is influenced by local bonding environments. These insights highlight the role of local bonding in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally complex intermetallics.








Abstract
Intermetallics, which encompass a wide range of compounds, often exhibit similar or closely related crystal structures, resulting in various intermetallic systems with structurally derivative phases. This study examines the hypothesis that deformation behavior can be transferred from fundamental building blocks to structurally related phases using the binary samarium‐cobalt system. SmCo2 and SmCo5 are investigated as fundamental building blocks and compared them to the structurally related SmCo3 and Sm2Co17 phases. Nanoindentation and micropillar compression tests are performed to characterize the primary slip systems, complemented by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations via atomic‐scale modeling. The results show that while elastic properties of the structurally complex phases follow a rule of mixtures, their plastic deformation mechanisms are more intricate, influenced by the stacking and bonding nature within the crystal's building blocks. These findings underscore the importance of local bonding environments in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally related intermetallics, providing crucial insights for the development of high‐performance intermetallic materials.

<title>High External Quantum Efficiency and Ultra‐Narrowband Organic Photodiodes Using Single‐Component Photoabsorber With Multiple‐Resonance Effect</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This research provides a significant breakthrough in the field of narrowband organic photodiodes (OPDs) by introducing a novel class of boron‐nitrogen (BN) single‐component wavelength‐selective materials. The OPDs incorporating these single‐component BN photoabsorbers demonstrate record‐high external quantum efficiency of 33.77% and small full‐width half‐maximum of 36 nm in the reported narrowband OPDs using single‐component photoabsorbers.








Abstract
Organic photodiodes (OPDs) that utilize wavelength‐selective absorbing molecules offer a direct approach to capturing specific wavelengths of light in multispectral sensors/imaging systems without filters. However, they exhibit broad response bandwidths, low external quantum efficiency (EQE), and often require compromises in two‐component photoactive materials. Herein, the first utility of boron‐nitrogen (BN) single‐component photoabsorbers, leveraging a multi‐resonance effect are introduced to attain OPDs with both record‐high EQE of 33.77% and ultra‐small full‐width half‐maximum (FWHM) of 36 nm in the reported narrowband OPDs using single‐component photoabsorbers. It is found that the outstanding performance of these narrowband OPDs can be attributed to the ultra‐small FWHM, slow charge recombination, low activation energy, and balanced bipolar charge transport within the para‐tert‐butyl substituted B,N‐embedded rigid polycyclic molecule (BNCz) film. Furthermore, BN derivatives such as BN(p)SCH3, BN(p)SO2CH3, and pyBN‐m‐H have also shown high EQE, minimal FWHM, and tunable photoresponse peaks ranging from blue‐violet to blue‐turquoise, highlighting the potential of BN molecules and molecular engineering in the development of novel narrowband absorbers for advanced wavelength‐selective OPDs. Such pioneering working can provide a class of novel narrowband absorbers to propel the advancement of high‐performance wavelength‐selective OPDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dual strategy for the design of covalent organic frameworks integrates molecular rigidity–flexibility regulation with hard–soft atom incorporation. The synthesized DAPhen‐COF achieves over 95% removal of Np(V), Pu(IV), and Am(III), with a separation factor exceeding 5000 for Np/Gd. This study marks the first application of covalent organic frameworks in separating various transuraniums from lanthanides.








Abstract
Separating actinides from lanthanides is essential for managing nuclear waste and promoting sustainable nuclear energy development. The recycling of transuranium elements (TRUs: Np, Pu, Am) is also significant for various nuclear technology applications. In this study, a dual strategy is introduced to designing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that skillfully combines molecular rigidity with flexibility, integrating both hard and soft donor atoms in the synthesis of monomers. This results in a specialized COF that efficiently and selectively captures TRUs from acidic aqueous solutions. By utilizing the topological arrangement of rigid ligands to influence the twisting and stretching of flexible ligands, coordination environment featuring nitrogen and oxygen is created, which enhances the separation of transuranium in various oxidation states over lanthanides. In 0.5 m HNO3 solution, the as‐synthesized DAPhen‐COF achieves removal rates of 99.1% for Np(V) and 95.8% for Pu(IV). For Am(III), the removal rate reaches 98.6% in 0.01 m HNO3. DAPhen‐COF exhibits remarkable selectivity for Np(V), with a separation factor of over 5000 for Np/Gd, outperforming other solid‐phase materials. This research provides a comprehensive investigation into the design and synthesis of COFs for actinide capture, marking the first application of COFs in the separation of various TRUs over lanthanides.

An ionogel comprised of mobile ions and piezoelectric polymer matrices is characteristic of both piezoelectric and ionic thermoelectric attributes. The gel is capable of capturing heat, stress, and moisture from the environment and converting them into remarkably high voltage outputs, enabling acute sensing in clinic scenarios.








Abstract
A paradigm ionogel consisting of ionic liquid (IL) and PVDF−HFP composites is made, which inherently possesses dual‐function ionic thermoelectric (iTE) and piezoelectric (PE) attributes. This study investigates an innovative “PE‐enhanced iTEs” effect, wherein the ionic thermopower exhibits a 58% enhancement while the ionic conductivity arises more than 2× within a PE‐induced internal electric field. By harnessing these multifaceted features, fully self‐powered, multimodal sensors demonstrate their superior energy conversion capabilities, which possessed minimum sensitivities of 0.13 mV kPa−1 and 0.96 mV K−1 in pressure and temperature alterations, respectively. The PE augmentation of iTEs is maximized by ≈3× under rising water pressure. Their swift and sophisticated responses to various in vivo vital signs simultaneously in a hemorrhagic shock scenario, indicative of good prospects in the clinical medicine field are showcased.

<title>Fully Transparent and Distortion‐Free Monotonically Stretchable Substrate by Nanostructure Alignment</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414794?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414794?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
For achieving monotonic transparent, stretchable substrates with near‐zero Poisson's ratio, this approach utilizes nanoscopic block copolymer alignment via shear‐rolling. This alignment of nanostructures smaller than the wavelength of light yields a near‐zero Poisson's ratio (≈0.07), eliminating vertical contraction and maintaining distortion‐free performance under uniform strain across the entire area even under 50% strain, with excellent optical properties.








Abstract
Stretchable devices, garnering increasing attention as next‐generation form factors, have a crucial problem in that vertical contraction occurs during stretching, causing image distortion of stretchable displays and discomfort in skin‐attached devices. Previous structural strategies to mitigate vertical contraction, such as auxetic reentrants and wrinkles, suffer from the drawback that their structure becomes visible during stretching. In this study, this issue is addressed by unidirectionally aligning nanoscopic cylinders within block copolymer elastomer films. Employing a shear‐rolling process at high temperatures on thick films of polystyrene‐block‐polyisobutylene‐block‐polystyrene thermoplastic elastomers, macroscopic mechanical anisotropy is achieved, resulting in completely transparent and monotonically stretchable substrates devoid of vertical or depth distortion during deformation. Significantly, the unidirectional orientation of high‐modulus cylindrical nanostructures induces macroscopic mechanical anisotropy with a modulus ratio exceeding five times. While the Poisson's ratio of conventional elastic materials hovers around ≈0.5, this mechanical anisotropy minimizes vertical contraction, yielding a Poisson's ratio below 0.07. Moreover, owing to the negligible size of the nanocylinders compared to visible‐light wavelengths, the substrate can be monotonically uniaxially stretched while maintaining high transmittance without introducing distortions, surface undulations, or haziness, resulting in distortion‐free stretchable substrates.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study develops TP/ZIS‐10 S‐scheme heterostructures, uncovers unique charge transfer dynamics via TR EPR, ISIXPS, and fs‐TA spectroscopy, and provides novel insights into charge carrier dynamics at S‐scheme heterojunction interfaces, paving the way for efficient and stable organic–inorganic S‐scheme photocatalysts for green energy conversion.








Abstract
Understanding charge carrier transfer at heterojunction interfaces is critical for advancing solar energy conversion technologies. This study utilizes continuous wave (CW), pulse, and time‐resolved (TR) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to explore the radical species formed at the TAPA (tris(4−aminophenyl)amine)‐PDA (Terephthaldicarboxaldehyde)/ZnIn2S4 (TP/ZIS) heterojunction interface. CW and pulse EPR identify stable radical defects localized near the interface, accessible to water molecules. Time‐resolved EPR reveals a photoinduced electron transfer from TP to ZIS, leading to the generation of spin‐correlated radical pairs under light irradiation, signifying efficient charge carrier separation and spatial transfer within the S‐scheme heterojunction. This electron transfer mechanism, confirmed through in situ X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, suppresses undesirable carrier recombination, extending charge carrier lifetimes. These findings provide novel insights into the transport direction of charge carriers at the S‐scheme heterojunction interface, offering valuable guidance for designing highly efficient and stable organic–inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts for solar energy applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents a plasmonic photocatalyst with an ordered Au nanoparticle array on SrTiO3, enhancing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining constant resonant energy due to surface lattice resonance. This balance improves charge separation and increases local charge density at active sites, boosting water oxidation activity sevenfold. These results demonstrate a promising strategy for optimizing SPR characteristics to enhance photocatalytic performance on plasmonic platforms, opening avenues for more efficient energy conversion applications.








Abstract
Plasmonic resonance intensity in metallic nanostructures plays a crucial role in charge generation and separation, directly affecting plasmon‐induced photocatalytic activity. Engineering strategies to enhance plasmonic effects involve designing specific nanostructures, such as triangular nanoplates with sharp corners or dimer nanostructures with hot spots. However, these approaches often lead to a trade‐off between enhanced plasmonic intensity and resonance energy, which ultimately determines local charge density and photocatalytic performance. Here, inspired by theoretical predications, it is shown that a flexibly controlled plasmonic photocatalyst, consisting of an ordered array of Au nanoparticles on a SrTiO3 surface, exhibits an enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining a constant SPR resonant energy, due to the presence of surface lattice resonance. This trade‐off results in improved charge separation efficiency and an increase in local charge density at catalytically active sites, as verified by theoretical simulations, surface photovoltage microscopy, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, the optimized periodic photocatalyst shows a 7‐fold increase in water oxidation activity over disordered nanostructures. This work provides a novel approach for balancing the intensity and energy of SPR, which will contribute to optimizing photocatalytic activity on plasmonic platforms.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dynamic liquid metal–microfiber interlocking interface is proposed to develop a highly stable and conductive metastructured fiber, which shows remarkable conductivity of 1.5 × 106 S m−1, and maintains stable conductance with only a 16% relative resistance change at 100% strain. These fibers are demonstrated as versatile platforms for wearable temperature‐visualizing electrothermal heaters and fully stretchable smart sensing‐display fabrics.








Abstract
Stretchable fibers with high conductivity are vital components for smart textiles and wearable electronics. However, embedding solid conductive materials in polymers significantly reduces conductive pathways when stretched, causing a sharp drop in conductivity. Here, a stretchable metastructured fiber with dynamic liquid metal–microfiber interlocking interface is reported to realize highly conductive yet ultrastable conductance. The Cu‐EGaIn mixture is partially embedded within the porous microfiber mat, thereby enabling its roll‐up into a spiral‐layered metastructured fiber with self‐compensating conductive pathways. The metastructured fiber shows outstanding performance, including high conductivity of 1.5 × 106 S m−1, large stretchability up to 629%, and ultrastable conductance with only 16% relative resistance change at 100% strain, which far surpasses the theoretical value. Moreover, these fibers have served as versatile platforms for wearable temperature‐visualizing electrothermal fiber heaters and fully stretchable smart sensing‐display fabrics. This dynamic solid–liquid interfacial interlocking strategy is promising for stretchable electronics.

A Pd‐Sn intermetallic compound with Pd deficiency (Pd1.9−xSn, x = 0.06), enhanced by Sn incorporation from SnOx, demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation. The efficient dissociation of the C–C bond highlights its potential for energy conversion applications.








Abstract
A common challenge in electrochemical processes is developing high performance, stable catalysts for specific chemical reactions. In this work, a Pd‐Sn intermetallic compound with   Pd site deficiency (Pd1.9−xSn) (x = 0.06) and trace amount of SnOx was synthesised by controlled process. Under the electrochemical conditions, the deficient Pd site is filled by metallic Sn, which generates a highly active and stable (Pd1.84Sn0.06)Sn catalyst for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The crystal structure and atomic arrangements for synthesized and in situ generated compound are comprehensively characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. The in situ generated catalyst exhibits excellent performance toward EOR (anodic reaction in fuel cell), which outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art Pd/C catalyst by three times in terms of activity. Furthermore, it is observed that the catalyst preferentially cleaves the CC bond in ethanol, which is a crucial process that enhances the efficiency of the fuel cells. The catalyst retains its superlative activity even after 1500 cycles of continuous operation. The mechanism for EOR and CC bond cleavage is evidenced by operando Infra Red spectroscopy and Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy (DEMS), and the driving force toward excellent performance has been proposed via theoretical calculations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work develops a one‐step strategy to fabricate bi‐continuous phase hydrogels under mild conditions. The resulting hydrogel exhibits excellent conductivity, elasticity, strain insensitivity, and biocompatibility. The hydrogel‐based electrode facilitates motion‐artifact‐free electrophysiological signal monitoring and enables wireless, multimodal data acquisition under dynamic conditions. This cutting‐edge technology offers potent tools for healthcare and medical management.








Abstract
Conducting polymer hydrogels have gained attention in the bioelectronics field due to their unique combination of biocompatibility and customizable mechanical properties. However, achieving both excellent conductivity and mechanical strength in a hydrogel remains a significant challenge, primarily because of the inherent conflict between the hydrophobic nature of conducting polymers and the hydrophilic characteristics of hydrogels. To address this issue, this work proposes a simple one‐step acid‐induced approach that not only promotes the gelation of hydrophilic polymers but also facilitates the in situ phase separation of hydrophobic conducting polymers under mild conditions. This results in a distinctive bi‐continuous phase structure with exceptional electrical property (906 mS cm−1) and mechanical performance (fracture strain of 1103%). The hydrogel forms robust percolating networks that maintain structural integrity under mechanical stress due to their entropic elasticity, providing remarkable strain insensitivity, low mechanical hysteresis, and an impressive resilience (95%). Electrodes fabricated from the conductive hydrogel exhibit stable and minimal interfacial contact impedance with skin (1–6 kilohms at 1–100 Hz) and significantly lower noise power (4.9 µV2). This work believes that the motion‐insensitive characteristics and mechanical robustness of this hydrogel will enable efficient and reliable monitoring of biological signals, establishing a new benchmark in the bioelectronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The efficient energy transfer of rolling spheres based on the basic law of physics forms the basis of a novel strategy, wherein the 3 interface π‐π stacking interactions induce the “rolling behavior” of microspheres. This approach mitigates local stress concentrations in composite epoxy resins, resulting in a synergistic enhancement of strength and toughness.








Abstract
The intrinsic compromise between strength and toughness in composite epoxy resins significantly constrains their practical applications. In this study, a novel strategy is introduced, leveraging interfacial π‐π stacking interactions to induce the “rolling behavior” of microsphere fillers, thereby facilitating efficient energy dissipation. This approach is corroborated through theoretical simulations and experimental validation. The resulting composite epoxy resin demonstrates an impressive 49.8% enhancement in strength and a remarkable 358.9% improvement in toughness compared to conventional epoxy resins, accompanied by substantially reduced hysteresis. Moreover, this system achieves reversible closed‐loop recyclability and rapid repair capabilities. The preliminary demonstration of “force‐temperature equivalence” further establishes a novel pathway for the design of high‐performance composite epoxy materials.

A simple design is illustrated for achieving prolonged and damped chemomechanical oscillations using a stimuli‐responsive membrane‐bound microgel within a stratified environment containing partitioned swelling and deswelling stimuli. The swelling and deswelling responses of the microgel in the bottom and top layers are coupled to buoyant motility via membrane‐mediated displacement of the external media.








Abstract
The design of chemomechanical self‐oscillators, which execute oscillations in the presence of constant stimuli lacking periodicity, is a step toward the development of autonomous and interactive soft robotic systems. This work presents a simple design of prolonged chemomechanical oscillatory movement in a microgel system capable of buoyant motility within stratified chemical media containing spatially localized sinking and floating stimuli. Three design elements are developed: a stimuli‐responsive membranized calcium alginate microgel, a Percoll density gradient for providing stratified antagonistic chemical media, and transduction of microgel particle size actuation into buoyant motility via membrane‐mediated displacement of the Percoll media. The presence of citrate or calcium ions in different layers of the Percoll media gives rise to swelling (buoyancy) or contraction (geotaxis), respectively, which in turn mediate the shuttling of the microgels between the layers to produce prolonged or damped chemomechanical oscillatory trajectories. The concentration‐dependence of the oscillatory behavior in the stratified media, the density gap between the Percoll layers, and the kinetic asymmetry of microgel swelling and deswelling are studied. The illustrated modular design allows for the development of chemomechanical self‐oscillators responsive to light, pH, or temperature, which will find applications in interactive soft robotics, autonomous microbots, and intelligent materials.

The stacked structure design method of integrating inorganic fillers with high ɛr, and PEI polymers with high breakdown strength is proposed. BNKT‐BST dense ceramics are prepared by solid‐phase reaction method, and BNKT‐BST/PEI nanocomposites are prepared by casting and hot‐pressing method, which resulted in nanocomposites with excellent energy storage properties at high temperatures.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are crucial for electronic communications and industrial applications due to their high breakdown field strength (Eb), fast charge/discharge speed, and temperature stability. The upcoming electronic‐electrical systems pose a significant challenge, necessitating polymeric dielectrics to exhibit exceptional thermal stability and energy storage capabilities at high temperatures. Here, ultra‐high dielectric constant (ɛr) and charge/discharge efficiency (η) of 0.55Bi0.5(Na0.84K0.16)0.5TiO3‐0.45(Bi0.1Sr0.85)TiO3 (BNKT‐BST) ceramics are prepared by the solid‐phase reaction method and added to polyetherimide (PEI) to form BNKT‐BST/PEI nanocomposites with various structures. The findings indicate that the sandwich‐structured BNKT‐BST/PEI nanocomposite achieves the highest discharged energy density (Ud) of 7.7 J cm−3 with η of 80.2% when the Eb is 650 MV m−1 at 150 °C. This is primarily due to the incorporation of BNKT‐BST nanoparticles and the multilayer structure design, which significantly improves the composite's ɛr and Eb. Additionally, the sandwich‐structured composites show excellent cycling stability at 500 MV m−1 and 150 °C, with Ud of ≈ 4.7 J cm−3 and η greater than 90%. The research presents nanocomposites with high energy storage density and excellent stability, crucial for the practical application of polymer dielectrics in high‐temperature environments.

A robust method is presented for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by incorporating a supporting layer of inverse opal photonic structures. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical modulation of afterglow in polymeric phosphors and position the resulting Janus film for potential applications in biosensing and information storage.








Abstract
Tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors is critical for advancing their use in optical data storage and display technologies. Despite advancements in polymer matrix design and dopant engineering, achieving dynamic control over afterglow intensity remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel approach is introduced for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by integrating them into an inverse opal photonic structure. By precisely aligning the photonic stopband of the inverse opal structure with the afterglow band of the polymer film, a remarkable 15‐fold enhancement in afterglow intensity is achieved. This enhancement is tunable, decreasing from 15 to 1.2 by infiltrating the photonic structure with media of varying refractive indices ranging from 1.00 (air) to 1.37 (ethyl acetate). The tunability arises from reducing the mismatch between the stopband and the afterglow band, as the weighted refractive index shifts between 1.15 and 1.40. Additionally, the inverse opal photonic structure induces angle‐dependent structural colors in the Janus polymeric phosphors, modulated by the refractive index of the infiltrating media. This integration of dynamically tunable afterglow with angle‐dependent structural coloration unlocks new potential for advanced optoelectronic applications.

Sterical aryl immobilizing groups are incorporated (phenyl and pyridine) at the C8 site of the rigid fluorene spacer. These immobilizing groups restrict both rotational and rocking motions. The completely confined conformation demonstrates enhanced TADF performance.








Abstract
Intramolecular through‐space charge‐transfer (TSCT) excited states have emerged as promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. This study addresses the challenges in tuning excited state dynamics through conformational engineering, which significantly impacts exciton utilization. An effective strategy is presented to enhance the performance of TSCT‐TADF molecules by restricting the lateral rocking of the spiro unit via immobilizing groups, which indirectly adjusts the conformations of the donor and acceptor subunits. This approach is successfully illustrated with two TSCT‐TADF emitters, 8PhDM‐B and 8PyDM‐B, featuring sterical aryl phenyl and pyridine substitutions at the C8 site of a rigid spiro‐fluorene bridge. Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) utilizing these emitters demonstrated impressive maximum external quantum efficiencies of 33.1% and 31.0%, respectively. The findings underscore the importance of the rocking confined strategy in refining excited state dynamics, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of highly efficient OLED emitters.

<title>High‐Throughput Single‐Cell Analysis of Local Nascent Protein Deposition in 3D Microenvironments via Extracellular Protein Identification Cytometry (EPIC)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Knowledge of the extracellular matrix drives the understanding of cell behavior. However, current analysis methods are limited to either bulk or low‐throughput single‐cell analysis, thus masking the heterogeneity in matrix deposition. Extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) combines the high‐throughput single‐cell analysis of flow cytometry with engineered microniche 3D cell culture, jointly enabling in situ matrix analysis of large cell populations.








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) guides cell behavior and tissue fate. Cell populations are notoriously heterogeneous leading to large variations in cell behavior at the single‐cell level. Although insights into population heterogeneity are valuable for fundamental biology, regenerative medicine, and drug testing, current ECM analysis techniques only provide either averaged population‐level data or single‐cell data from a limited number of cells. Here, extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) is presented as a novel platform technology that enables high‐throughput measurements of local nascent protein deposition at single‐cell level. Specifically, human primary chondrocytes are microfluidically encapsulated in enzymatically crosslinked microgels of 16 picoliter at kHz rates, forming large libraries of discrete 3D single‐cell microniches in which ECM can be deposited. ECM proteins are labeled using fluorescence immunostaining to allow for nondestructive analysis via flow cytometry. This approach reveals population heterogeneity in matrix deposition at unprecedented throughput, allowing for the identification and fluorescent activated cell sorting‐mediated isolation of cellular subpopulations. Additionally, it is demonstrated that inclusion of a second cell into microgels allows for studying the effect of cell‐cell contact on matrix deposition. In summary, EPIC enables high‐throughput single‐cell analysis of nascent proteins in 3D microenvironments, which is anticipated to advance fundamental knowledge and tissue engineering applications.

Abstract
The growing significance of information technology requires advanced information storage and security solutions. While extending traditional 2D codes with additional parameters has led to promising 3D codes, increasing information capacity and security remains challenging. Herein, a 3D quick response (QR) cube platform that utilizes near‐infrared (NIR)‐to‐NIR upconversion nanoparticles as light‐emitting probes, benefiting from their photostability and low scattering properties.

<title>Simultaneous Regulating the Surface, Interface, and Bulk via Phosphating Modification for High‐Performance Li‐Rich Layered Oxides Cathodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A straightforward and effective “all‐in‐one” modification strategy is exploited to achieve cooperative enhancements across the surface, interface, and bulk phase. This strategy provides a comprehensive understanding of reversible and irreversible characteristics of oxygen redox processes, offering theoretical guidance and experimental evidence for enhancing anionic redox reversibility and designing high‐performance Li‐rich Mn‐based layered oxides.








Abstract
Li‐rich Mn‐based layered oxides (LRMOs) are regarded as the leading cathode materials to overcome the bottleneck of higher energy density. Nevertheless, they encounter significant challenges, including voltage decay, poor cycle stability, and inferior rate performance, primarily due to irreversible oxygen release, transition metal dissolution, and sluggish transport kinetics. Moreover, traditionally single modification strategies do not adequately address these issues. Herein, an innovative “all‐in‐one” modification strategy is developed, simultaneously regulating the surface, interface, and bulk via an in‐situ gas–solid interface phosphating reaction to create P‐doped Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2@Spinel@Li3PO4. Specifically, Li3PO4 surface coating layer shields particles from electrolyte corrosion and enhances Li+ diffusion; in‐situ constructed spinel interfacial layer reduces phase distortion and suppresses the lattice strain; the strong P─O bond derived from P‐doping stabilizes the lattice oxygen frame and inhibits the release of O2, thereby improving the reversibility of oxygen redox reaction. As a result, the phosphatized LRMO demonstrates an exceptional capacity retention of 82.1% at 1C after 300 cycles (compared to 50.8% for LRMO), an outstanding rate capability of 170.5 mAh g−1 at 5C (vs 98.9 mAh g−1 for LRMO), along with excellent voltage maintenance and thermostability. Clearly, this “all‐in‐one” modification strategy offers a novel approach for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries.

<title>Orbital Coupling of Dual‐Atom Sites Boosts Electrocatalytic NO Oxidation and Dynamic Intracellular Response</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new strategy is proposed for the precise fabrication of orbital‐coupled dual‐atomic sites, which aims to enhance the affinity between the Ni sites and NO within Co1Ni1‐NC. This strategy is specifically designed to significantly boost the performance of the NO oxidation reaction, contributing to advancements in the field of single‐cell in situ monitoring of NO.









Abstract
In situ measurement of nitric oxide (NO) in living tissue and single cells is highly important for achieving a profound comprehension of cellular functionalities and facilitating the precise diagnosis of critical diseases; however, the progress is greatly hindered by the weak affinity of ultratrace concentration NO in cellular environment toward electrocatalysts. Herein, a new strategy is reported for precisely constructing orbital coupled dual‐atomic sites to enhance the affinity between the metal atomic sites and NO on a class of N‐doped hollow carbon matrix dual‐atomic sites Co─Ni (Co1Ni1‐NC) for greatly boosting electrocatalytic NO performance. The as‐synthesized Co1Ni1‐NC demonstrates a substantially higher current density than Ni1‐NC and Co1‐NC, coupled with exceptional stability with a negligible degradation rate of 0.6 µA·cm−2·h−1, which is the best among the state‐of‐the‐art electrocatalysts for NO oxidation. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively reveal that the pivotal role of d‐d orbit coupling between Co and Ni sites enables Ni to acquire additional electrons, leading to the occupation of Ni's 3dxy/yz within the 2π orbitals of NO, thus weakening the N≡O triple bond and concurrently accelerating NO adsorption kinetics. It is demonstrated that Co1Ni1‐NC‐coated nanoelectrode can achieve the in situ sensing of NO in living organs and single cells.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study develops a novel gelatin hydrogel through microstructural optimization. The resulting hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical properties compared to conventional methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) gels while preserving key benefits like rapid gelation, cell adhesion, and complete biodegradability. These combined properties significantly enhance the precision and complexity of gelatin hydrogels for 3D printing and their applications in biomedicine.








Abstract
Gelatin hydrogels (e.g., methacrylated gelatin gel, abbreviated GelMA gel) have garnered significant attention in tissue engineering and therapeutic drug and cell delivery due to their complete degradability and intrinsic ability to support cell adhesion. However, their practical applications are often constrained by their poor mechanical performance, which stems from their single network structure. This limitation poses significant challenges in load‐bearing scenarios and restricts their use in advanced biofabrication technologies, where robust mechanical properties are essential. Here a hydrogel is developed composed entirely of gelatin using a phototriggered transient‐radical and persistent‐radical coupling (PTPC) reaction to achieve an optimized microstructure. This hydrogel features a phase‐separated structure with enhanced interfacial bonding, significantly improving mechanical performance compared to conventional GelMA gels. Notably, this approach preserves the inherent properties of gelatin, including biocompatibility, cell adhesion, and degradability, thereby extending its applicability in the biomedical field, particularly in advanced biofabrication methods such as 3D printing. This approach offers a superior solution to meet the complex demands of sophisticated biomanufacturing technologies, expanding the potential applications of gelatin hydrogels in the biomedical field.

<title>Giant Ultrabroadband Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Engendered by Two‐Photon Absorption in α‐In2Se3 for Chiral Terahertz Wave Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work reports giant ultrabroadband two‐photon absorption (TPA) driven bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 utilizing wavelength‐tunable terahertz emission spectroscopy. Ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 outperforms standard terahertz emitters like p‐InAs, enabling efficient chiral terahertz wave emission with tunable orientation and ellipticity. The work highlights TPA‐induced BPVE in narrow‐bandgap ferroelectrics supports high‐performance BPVE devices and guides chiral THz wave design.








Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) can break the Shockley–Queisser limit by leveraging the inherent asymmetry of crystal lattice without a junction. However, this effect is mainly confined to UV–vis spectrum due to the wide‐bandgap nature of traditional ferroelectric materials, thereby limiting the exploration of the infrared light‐driven efficient BPVE. Herein, giant two‐photon absorption (TPA) driven BPVE is uncovered from visible to infrared in ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 utilizing wavelength‐tunable terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy. Remarkably, α‐In2Se3 exhibits exceptional THz emission efficiency in the infrared region, surpassing renowned THz emitters like p‐InAs and achieving an efficiency approximately eight times the magnitude of standard ZnTe. The power exponent‐type pump fluence and quadruple polarization features reveal a unique TPA‐driven BPVE, corroborated by a fourth‐order nonlinear oscillator model. Notably, TPA‐engendered BPVE efficiency approaches 68% of that observed in the single‐photon absorption process. Moreover, the TPA responses display clear polarization anisotropy, with considerably relative phase and amplitude driven by synchronous in‐plane and out‐of‐plane polarization, leading to chiral THz waves with high efficiency, tunable orientation, and controllable ellipticity. This work highlights the advantages of TPA‐induced BPVE responses in narrow‐bandgap ferroelectric semiconductors, enhancing spectral utilization efficiency, aiding high‐performance devices based on BPVE, and guiding chiral THz wave design.

This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies. When neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of stroke‐affected rats, it significantly reduces the brain infarct area, promotes synaptic reorganization, and restores motor functions and balance.









Abstract
Implantable neural probes hold promise for acquiring brain data, modulating neural circuits, and treating various brain disorders. However, traditional implantable probes face significant challenges in practical applications, such as balancing sensitivity with biocompatibility and the difficulties of in situ neural information monitoring and neuromodulation. To address these challenges, this study developed an implantable hydrogel probe capable of recording neural signals, modulating neural circuits, and treating stroke. Amylopectin is integrated into the hydrogels, which can induce reorientation of the poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) chain and create compliant interfaces with brain tissues, enhancing both sensitivity and biocompatibility. The hydrogel probe shows the capability of continuously recording deep brain signals for 8 weeks. The hydrogel probe is effectively utilized to study deep brain signals associated with various physiological activities. Neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of rats, enabling control over their limb behaviors through evoked signals. When applied to the primary motor cortex of stroke‐affected rats, neuromodulation significantly reduced the brain infarct area, promoted synaptic reorganization, and restored motor functions and balance. This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies.

A programmable, morphologically adaptive nanomaterial, FeFKC, is developed as an efficient delivery system for nanocatalytic tumor therapy. Through pH‐triggered shape‐shifting, FeFKC enhances endocytosis, lysosomal escape, and mitochondrial localization, significantly boosting its catalytic impact. It suppressed tumors by up to 95% without evident safety concerns in mouse models, indicating broad potential for future targeted therapies.








Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy holds significant promise in cancer treatment by exploiting the high oxidative stress within tumor cells. However, efficiently delivering nanocatalytic agents to tumor tissues and maximizing their catalytic activity in situ remain critical challenges. Morphology‐adaptive delivery systems, capable of adjusting their physical form in response to physiological conditions, offer unique spatiotemporal control for navigating complex biological environments like the tumor microenvironment. While designing systems that undergo multiple shape transformations often involves complex stimuli‐responsive mechanisms, making programmable responses through simple designs highly desirable yet challenging. Here, FeFKC, an innovative adaptive material is introduced that achieves multi‐step morphological transformations at the tissue level and amplifies catalytic activity through a straightforward design. As the microenvironmental pH decreases during drug delivery, FeFKC dynamically transitions between single chains, nanoparticles, and nanofibers. This programmable shape‐shifting facilitates deep tumor penetration, enhanced cellular uptake, and lysosomal escape, significantly improving its catalytic efficiency in nanocatalytic tumor therapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that FeFKC achieves impressive tumor suppression efficacy of up to 95% without notable biosafety concerns. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive nanomaterials with programmable shape‐transforming capabilities to overcome biological barriers and enhance catalytic therapy, opening new avenues for cancer treatment and other complex diseases.

Tough polyurethane hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen‐bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure are prepared by in situ water‐induced microphase separation. The outstanding mechanical performances endow the hydrogels with the capability to resist abdominal pressure and prevent hernia formation in vivo.








Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical performances similar to load‐bearing tissues are in demand for in vivo applications. In this work, inspired by the self‐assembly behavior of amphiphilic polymers, polyurethane‐based tough hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen‐bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure through in situ water‐induced microphase separation strategy are developed, in which poly(ethylene glycol)‐based polyurethane (PEG‐PU, hydrophilic) and poly(ε‐caprolactone)‐based polyurethane (PCL‐PU, hydrophobic) are blended to form dry films followed by water swelling. A multiple hydrogen bonding factor, imidazolidinyl urea, is introduced into the synthesis of the two polyurethanes, and the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between PEG‐PU and PCL‐PU can promote homogeneous microphase separation for the construction of bicontinuous phase structures in the hydrogel network, by which the hydrogel features break strength of 12.9 MPa, fracture energy of 2435 J m−2, and toughness of 48.2 MJ m−3. As a biomedical patch, the outstanding mechanical performances can withstand abdominal pressure to prevent hernia formation in the abdominal wall defect model. Compared to the commercial PP mesh, hydrogel can prevent tissue/organ adhesion to reduce inflammatory responses and promote angiogenesis, thereby accelerating the repair of abdominal wall defects. This work may provide useful inspiration for researchers to design different gel materials through solvent‐induced microphase separation.

The camouflage‐monitoring‐protection triune integrated modular unit achieves remarkable optical‐microwave compatibility, which is instructed by machine learning and further assembled into a programmable array, exhibiting extraordinary programmability, multi‐scenario adaptability, fast responsiveness, and long‐life durability. The approach paves the universal way for optical‐electromagnetic compatibility and material genetics‐deviceization systematization.








Abstract
Optical‐electromagnetic compatible devices are urgently required in intelligent building monitors and cross‐band protection. Meanwhile, the insufficient systematicness and semi‐empirical attempts significantly limit the prosperity of cross‐band materials, causing enormous challenges for deviceization and material database construction. Herein, the systematical component‐deviceization‐machine learning prediction‐array construction strategy is attempted to solve the bottleneck issues. A luminance‐triggered camouflage‐monitoring‐protection triune integrated modular unit (IMU) is hierarchically encapsulated to simultaneously achieve efficient anti‐electromagnetic interference (EMI), light‐absorbing, quick gradient‐colorization response. Moreover, an illumination intensity dataset and a surrogate model based on fully connected neural network fitting (FCNN‐fitting) are constructed, which accurately predicts the light‐absorbing property of IMUs and can be instructional for material selection. The IMUs are specifically assembled into a 4*4 array, aiming at multi‐scenario application of programmable display, camouflage pattern, surface conformality, and rapid replaceability. This work paves the path and provides a promising strategy for optical‐electromagnetic compatibility and material genetics‐deviceization‐array systematization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A metabolism‐engineered bacterium inspired by sulfur‐metabolizing bacteria is developed, functioning as a live drug that efficiently and precisely depletes the substrate cysteine, thereby completely blocking cysteine metabolism. This disruption dismantles the ferroptosis defense system in PDAC cells, triggers potent ferroptosis, and achieves effective treatment. This introduces a novel approach to treating PDAC by exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities with living engineered bacteria.









Abstract
Cysteine metabolism is a key determinant of the defense against ferroptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Blocking cysteine metabolism may trigger potent ferroptosis in PDAC cells by generating lipid peroxides during tumor metabolic processes. However, current methods to limit cysteine availability fall short, failing to efficiently block cysteine metabolism due to inadequate tumor targeting and compensatory cysteine sources. Inspired by sulfur‐metabolizing bacteria, synthetic biology to develop an engineered bacterium capable of directly depleting cysteine to block its metabolism is used. Acting as a living drug, these engineered bacteria colonize the tumor and continuously produce engineered cyst(e)inase enzyme (CGL) under the stimulation of tumor hypoxia. The CGL exhausts the substrate cysteine, completely impeding cysteine metabolism. This process dismantles the ferroptosis defense system in PDAC cells, triggers potent ferroptosis, and achieves efficient treatment. The results demonstrate that engineered bacteria designed for cysteine metabolism modulation possess unparalleled advantages in efficacy, persistence, and precision in blocking cysteine metabolism, making them highly suitable for effective ferroptosis treatment of PDAC.

2D vdW α‐In₂Se₃ is used as a ferroelectric tunneling junction in a planar structure with Au electrodes. The interface between the α‐In₂Se₃ semiconductor and the Au electrode is studied to achieve a large on/off ratio by inserting a SiO₂ insulating barrier. The polarization of α‐In₂Se₃ gradually changes with the applied pulses, mimicking synaptic properties and exhibiting linear LTP/LTD behavior.








Abstract
A synaptic memristor using 2D ferroelectric junctions is a promising candidate for future neuromorphic computing with ultra‐low power consumption, parallel computing, and adaptive scalable computing technologies. However, its utilization is restricted due to the limited operational voltage memory window and low on/off current (ION/OFF) ratio of the memristor devices. Here, it is demonstrated that synaptic operations of 2D In2Se3 ferroelectric junctions in a planar memristor architecture can reach a voltage memory window as high as 16 V (±8 V) and ION/OFF ratio of 108, significantly higher than the current literature values. The power consumption is 10−5 W at the on state, demonstrating low power usage while maintaining a large ION/OFF ratio of 108 compared to other ferroelectric devices. Moreover, the developed ferroelectric junction mimicked synaptic plasticity through pulses in the pre‐synapse. The nonlinearity factors are obtained 1.25 for LTP, −0.25 for LTD, respectively. The single‐layer perceptron (SLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) on‐chip training results in an accuracy of up to 90%, compared to the 91% in an ideal synapse device. Furthermore, the incorporation of a 3 nm thick SiO2 interface between the α‐In2Se3 and the Au electrode resulted in ultrahigh performance among other 2D ferroelectric junction devices to date.

Wafer‐scale, highly oriented (almost monocrystalline) WS2 monolayers are synthesized on C/A‐plane sapphire substrates by chemical vapor deposition. A record high saturation current density of 675 µA µm−1 is achieved based on field‐effect transistors made of such films, outperforming the index required for high‐density integration circuits in IRDS 2025.








Abstract
2D transition‐metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors represent the most promising channel materials for post‐silicon microelectronics due to their unique structure and electronic properties. However, it remains challenging to synthesize wide‐bandgap TMDCs monolayers featuring large areas and high performance simultaneously. Herein, highly oriented WS2 monolayers are reproducibly synthesized through a templated growth strategy on vicinal C/A‐plane sapphire wafers. Various spectroscopic characterizations confirm the high crystallographic orientation and uniformity across the entire wafers. Electronic measurements for samples transferred onto SiO2/Si substrates reveal high average field‐effect mobilities of 62 and 180 cm2V−1s−1 at room temperature and 8 K, respectively. On hexagonal boron nitride substrates, these mobilities increase to 94 and 473 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. A record high saturation current density of 675 µA µm−1 is observed, outperforming the index required for high‐density integration circuits in IRDS 2025. This work paves the way for the application of wide‐bandgap TMDC monolayers in post‐silicon electronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new synthesis strategy for CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell colloidal quantum wells, which covers the green and blue spectral range and exhibits exceptional photoelectric properties, is achieved by direct cation exchange from Cd to Zn and hot‐injection shell growth. This enables the fabrication of high‐performance green and blue light‐emitting diodes with the peak external quantum efficiencies of 20.4% and 10.6%.








Abstract
The unique anisotropic properties of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) make them highly promising as components in nanocrystal‐based devices. However, the limited performance of green and blue light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) based on CQWs has impeded their practical applications. In this study, alloy CdZnSe core CQWs with precise compositions are tailored via direct cation exchange (CE) from CdSe CQWs with specific size, shape, and crystal structure and utilized hot‐injection shell (HIS) growth to synthesize CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell CQWs exhibiting exceptional optoelectronic characteristics. This approach enabled the successful fabrication green and blue LEDs manifesting superior performance compared to previously reported solution‐processed CQW‐LEDs. The devices demonstrated a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (20.4% for green and 10.6% for blue), accompanied by a maximum brightness 347,683 cd m−2 for green and 38,063 cd m−2 for blue. The high‐performance represents a significant advancement for nanocrystal‐based light‐emitting diodes (Nc‐LEDs) incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. This work provides a comprehensive synthesis strategy for enhancing the efficiency of Nc‐LEDs utilizing anisotropic nanocrystals.

<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202415083?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Topological supercoupling phenomenon is demonstrated for the first time, enabling efficient waveguide coupling over separation distances ranging from sub‐wavelength to multiple wavelengths, driven by the valley vortex wave in the topological valley Hall system. This approach aims at integrating increasing number of on‐chip components to further enhance the chip compactness and density.








Abstract
Waveguide interconnect coupling control is essential for enhancing the chip density of photonic integrated circuits to incorporate a growing number of components. However, a critical engineering challenge is to achieve both strong waveguide isolation and efficient long‐range coupling on a single chip. Here, a novel photonic supercoupling phenomenon is demonstrated for waveguide coupling over separation distances from a quarter to five wavelengths (λ), leveraging the tunable mode tails and the vortex energy flow in topological valley Hall system. A supercoupled integrated chip is developed, realizing a 91% coupling ratio and a −30 dB isolation over 2.8λ waveguide separations simultaneously. Supercoupled devices are further showcased including a waveguide‐cavity system with 3.2λ excitation distance, and a waveguide directional supercoupler with a compact coupling area of nearly λ2/4, which outperform conventional devices. Supercoupling provides new degrees of freedom for optimizing coupling and isolation between photonic integrated components, facilitating new applications in on‐chip sensing, lasing, and telecommunications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The newly developed nanopolymer, constructed from quinoidal acceptor–donor–acceptor (A‐D‐A) structured organic molecules, exhibits excellent near‐infrared II (NIR‐II) light absorption, phototherapy, and photoacoustic imaging performance. Combined with the immunomodulator R848, it efficiently treats primary ovarian tumors, inhibits metastatic tumors, and also demonstrates promising efficacy in breast cancer treatment.








Abstract
Photoagents with ultra‐high near‐infrared II (NIR‐II) light energy conversion efficiency hold great promise in tumor phototherapy due to their ability to penetrate deeper tissues and minimize damage to surrounding healthy cells. However, the development of NIR‐II photoagents remain challenging. In this study, an all‐fused‐ring quinoidal acceptor‐donor‐acceptor (A‐D‐A) molecule, SKCN, with a BTP core is synthesized, and nanoparticles named FA‐SNPs are prepared. The unique quinoidal structure enhances π‐electron delocalization and bond length uniformity, significantly reducing the bandgap of SKCN, resulting in strong NIR‐II absorption, a high molar extinction coefficient, and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 75.14%. Enhanced molecular rigidity also facilitates efficient energy transfer to oxygen, boosting reactive oxygen species generation. By incorporating the immunomodulator R848, FA‐SRNPs nanoparticles are further developed, effectively modulating the tumor immune microenvironment by reducing Tregs and M‐MDSCs infiltration, promoting dendritic cell maturation, M1 macrophage polarization, and activating CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Comprehensive studies using orthotopic ovarian cancer models demonstrated strong tumor targeting, photoacoustic imaging capabilities, and significant tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition, and also showing excellent therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic breast cancer model. This study provides strong evidence for the potential application of quinoidal A‐D‐A molecules in cancer photoimmunotherapy.

<title>A Universal Solid‐Phase Synthetic Strategy for Ultrafine Intermetallic Libraries Confined in Ordered Mesoporous Carbon</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This manuscript reports a solid‐phase route to prepare ultrafine intermetallic libraries confined in ordered mesoporous carbon by a strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates. The intermetallic catalyst discloses remarkably high activity and stability in oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Ordered intermetallic nanocatalysts supported on high‐surface‐area skeletons are of great importance in catalysis and have disclosed notable catalytic activity and stability that are remarkably better than their random alloy counterparts. Ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts are synthetically challenging, especially for universal and scaled‐up synthesis, because of inevitable sintering and phase separation under high temperatures that promote atomic alloying and ordering. Herein, a universal solid‐phase and scaled‐up method is reported for synthesizing ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts with uniform size distributions and wide compositional spaces confined in ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) supports, where the strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates remarkably suppress the high‐temperature sintering and phase separation even up to 1000 °C. Libraries of intermetallic nanocatalysts are successfully synthesized including 52 combinations of host platinum/palladium/rhodium with 15 guest elements confined in 4 OMC supports. Taking oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions as examples, the intermetallic PtFe nanocatalysts hold remarkable performance, whose activities reach up to ten times higher than commercial Pt/C and also are comparable to the best electrocatalysts reported recently. This feasible synthetic strategy offers an intermetallic library spanning from binary to senary materials for industrial synthesis and applications.

<title>Nanozymes and Their Potential Roles in the Origin of Life</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202412211?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202412211?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nanozymes, as enzyme mimics, demonstrate not only enzyme‐like structures and activities but also high stability and regulated catalytic functions. Minerals are also known for catalytic roles in the origin of life. Building on this foundation, this study proposes that nanozymes may serve as highly efficient pre‐enzymatic catalysts, potentially participating in the transition from inorganic molecules to primitive cells in chemical evolution.









Abstract
The origin of life has long been a central scientific challenge, with various hypotheses proposed. The chemical evolution, which supposes that inorganic molecules can transform into organic molecules and subsequent primitive cells, laid the foundation for modern theories. Inorganic minerals are believed to play crucial catalytic roles in the process. However, the harsh reaction conditions of inorganic minerals hinder the accumulation of organic molecules, preventing the efficient transition from inorganic molecules to biomacromolecules. Given the inherent physicochemical properties and enzyme‐like activities, this study proposes that nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme‐like activities, act as efficient prebiotic catalysts in the origin of life. This hypothesis is based on the following: First, unlike traditional minerals, nanominerals can catalyze organic synthesis under milder conditions. Second, nanominerals can not only protect biomolecules from radiation damage but also catalyze polymerization reactions to form functional biomacromolecules and further lipid vesicles. More importantly, nanominerals are abundant in terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. This perspective will systematically discuss the potential roles of nanozymes in the emergence of life based on the functions of minerals and the characteristics of nanozymes. We hope the research on nanozymes and the origin of life will bridge the gap between inorganic precursors and biomolecules under primitive environments.

<title>Low‐Volatility Fused‐Ring Solid Additive Engineering for Synergistically Elongating Exciton Lifetime and Mitigating Trap Density Toward Organic Solar Cells of 20.5% Efficiency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
3,6‐dibromothieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (3,6TTBr) is selected as a representative low‐volatility fused‐ring solid additive to elucidate the mechanism of photovoltaic performance. The integrated theoretical and experimental study reveals that 3,6TTBr's rigid, planar molecules interact with the terminal units of L8‐BO, facilitating spacing for neighboring molecules. To validate the broader applicability of the findings, 1,5‐dibromonaphthalene (1,5‐BN) is examined, achieving a notable PCE of 20.5%.








Abstract
Volatile solid additives (VSAs) with single or fused‐ring structures have attracted much attention for enhancing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). While the working mechanisms of high‐volatility single‐ring additives have been well studied, the influence of low‐volatility fused‐ring VSAs on molecular aggregations and exciton/carrier dynamics remains still unclear. Herein, 3,6‐dibromothieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (3,6TTBr) is selected as a representative low‐volatility fused‐ring VSA to elucidate its working mechanism. Via the theoretical and experimental joint investigation, it is found that rigid and planar 3,6TTBr molecules adsorb onto the terminal units of L8‐BO (acceptor), inducing loose space for adjacent molecules. The low‐volatility 3,6TTBr thus favors the L8‐BO center‐terminal packing with a larger interfragment distance, which relieves the L8‐BO over‐aggregation and induces the ordered packing. Consequently, the 3,6TTBr treatment reduces aggregation‐caused quenching, enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield and exciton lifetime of L8‐BO film. The combination of the above properties with the reduced trap density and improved carrier transport in the 3,6TTBr‐treated devices contributed to PCE of 20.1%. To validate the broad applicability of the findings, 1,5‐dibromonaphthalene (1,5‐BN), another low‐volatility fused‐ring solid, is explored. The devices with 1,5‐BN achieved an impressive PCE of 20.5%, verifying the validity of the low‐volatility fused‐ring VSA strategy for boosting OSC performances.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A star‐shaped cross‐linked polyglutamate (StCl) nanocarrier delivers melanoma‐associated peptide antigens via redox‐responsive linkers, inducing lymph node‐targeted antigen presentation. The nanoconjugate activates dendritic cells, promotes effector T‐cell responses, and enables tumor regression even in humanized patient‐derived preclinical models. This scalable platform offers a promising approach to cancer immunotherapy and synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitors.








Abstract
Tumor‐associated antigen‐based cancer vaccines suffer from limited clinical success compared to alternative immunotherapies in melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The anti‐tumor potential of a multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccine platform – a cross‐linked star‐shaped polyglutamate carrier (StCl) with marked lymphotropic character conjugated with melanoma‐associated peptide antigens is evaluated through redox‐responsive linkers. The co‐delivery of melanoma‐associated peptide antigens by the nanoconjugate platform induced significant effector immune responses in a mouse melanoma model. The nanoconjugate platform synergized with a PD‐1 inhibitor to revert the immunosuppressive melanoma tumor microenvironment by improving cytotoxic T‐cell infiltration, which prompted a superior anti‐tumor effect with prolonged overall survival without acute organ toxicity. The antigen‐specific anti‐tumor immune response induced by the nanoconjugate platform is also validated in a melanoma patient‐derived xenograft mouse model. A promising, versatile StCl‐based platform is reported for generating off‐the‐shelf multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccines for the safe and efficient immunotherapeutic treatment of melanoma.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, an intermolecular‐reinforced ether‐based electrolyte is presented to well stabilize the aggressive NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.2 VNa. With this electrolyte, a high‐voltage aAhmpere‐hour‐level pouch cell based on the cathode and hard carbon anode shows excellent long‐term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles.








Abstract
To fulfill the requirements for practical applications, it is urgent to boost the gravimetric energy density of sodium‐ion batteries. An effective way is to increase the charging voltage of O3‐type layered cathodes preferably to 4.2 V versus Na/Na+ (VNa). Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to achieve stable cycling of the cathodes at such a high cut‐off voltage. Here a novel electrolyte strategy to design an intermolecular‐reinforced electrolyte (IRE) is presented, utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, which facilitates stable high‐voltage cycling of the commercially viable NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM). While the NFM with the IRE exhibits a high specific capacity of ≈158 mAh g−1 at 4.2 VNa (130 mAh g−1 at 4.0 VNa), the aggressive cathode surface can still be effectively stabilized by the formation of favorable thin and inorganic‐rich cathode−electrolyte interfaces. Remarkably, under a high cut‐off voltage of 4.2 VNa, an industrial ampere‐hour‐level NFM||hard carbon pouch cell with the IRE electrolyte shows an excellent long‐term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles, largely outperforming the localized high‐concentration electrolyte (82.9% after 200 cycles).

This article presents a non‐destructive molecular encoding approach using hierarchical array of functionalized graphene‐based sensors for spatiotemporal analysis of volatile signaling molecules. Combined with deep learning, this method enables real‐time imaging and genetic profiling of organoids, deciphering molecular production pathways through specific enzymes and metabolic routes and advancing precision diagnostics and personalized medicine without harmful staining or sample destruction.








Abstract
Organoids mimic human organ function, offering insights into development and disease. However, non‐destructive, real‐time monitoring is lacking, as traditional methods are often costly, destructive, and low‐throughput. In this article, a non‐destructive chemical tomographic strategy is presented for decoding cyto‐proteo‐genomics of organoid using volatile signaling molecules, hereby, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), to indicate metabolic activity and development of organoids. Combining a hierarchical design of graphene‐based sensor arrays with AI‐driven analysis, this method maps VOC spatiotemporal distribution and generate detailed digital profiles of organoid morphology and proteo‐genomic features. Lens‐ and label‐free, it avoids phototoxicity, distortion, and environmental disruption. Results from testing organoids with the reported chemical tomography approach demonstrate effective differentiation between cyto‐proteo‐genomic profiles of normal and diseased states, particularly during dynamic transitions such as epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, the reported approach identifies key VOC‐related biochemical pathways, metabolic markers, and pathways associated with cancerous transformations such as aromatic acid degradation and lipid metabolism. This real‐time, non‐destructive approach captures subtle genetic and structural variations with high sensitivity and specificity, providing a robust platform for multi‐omics integration and advancing cancer biomarker discovery.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By virtue of the tailor‐made Pt electronic configuration and excellently corrosion‐resistant carbon support, the O‐PtCo@GCoNC integrating PtCo intermetallic with a Pt‐rich shell and highly graphitized carbon exhibits significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability, attaining outstanding performance in H2/air PEMFC, outstripping the United States Department of Energy 2025 target.








Abstract
Exploiting robust and high‐efficiency electrocatalysts for sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) toward long‐term operation for practical applications, yet remains challenging. Herein, the ordered PtCo intermetallic is reported with a Pt‐rich shell loaded on a highly graphitized carbon carrier (O‐PtCo@GCoNC) prepared by an impregnation annealing strategy. Systematic X‐ray spectroscopic, operando electrochemical techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that thanks to the synergistic interaction of the core–shell PtCo intermetallic structure with a tailor‐made Pt electronic configuration and highly graphitized carbon, O‐PtCo@GCoNC exhibits significantly enhanced activity and stability toward ORR. Crucially, O‐PtCo@GCoNC delivers a much‐enhanced mass activity of 0.83 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m HClO4, which only drops by 26.5% after 70 000 cycles (0.6–1.0 V vs RHE), and 10.8% after 10 000 cycles (1.0–1.5 V vs RHE), apparently overmatching Pt/C (0.19 A mgPt−1, 73.7%, and 63.1%). Moreover, O‐PtCo@GCoNC employed as the cathode catalyst in H2/air PEMFC achieves a superb peak power density (1.04 W cm−2 at 2.06 A cm−2), outperforming that of Pt/C (0.86 W cm−2 at 1.79 A cm−2). The cell voltage loss at 0.8 A cm−2 is 28 mV after 30 000 cycles, outstripping the United States Department of Energy 2025 target.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
TADF sensitizers targeting deep‐blue emitters are designed by combining the advantages of short‐range and long‐range charge‐transfer excited states. The resulting sensitizers enable high‐performance deep‐blue OLEDs with BT. 2020 blue gamut together with external quantum efficiency approaching 40%.








Abstract
The hyperfluorescence (HF) technology holds great promise for the development of high‐quality organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) for their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and low‐efficiency roll‐off. Sensitizer plays a crucial role in the performance of HF devices. However, designing sensitizers with simultaneous high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), rapid radiative decay (kr), and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) poses a great challenge, particularly for the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers targeting deep‐blue HF device. Herein, by introducing a boron‐containing multi‐resonance‐type acceptor into the multi‐tert‐butyl‐carbazole encapsulated benzene molecular skeleton, two TADF emitters featuring hybridized multi‐channel charge‐transfer pathways, including short‐range multi‐resonance, weakened through‐bond, and compact face‐to‐face through‐space charge‐transfer. Benefiting from the rational molecular design, the proof‐of‐concept sensitizers exhibit simultaneous rapid kr of 5.3 × 107 s−1, fast kRISC up to 5.9 × 105 s−1, a PQLY of near‐unity, as well as ideal deep‐blue emission in both solution and film. Consequently, the corresponding deep‐blue HF devices not only achieve chromaticity coordinates that fully comply with the latest BT. 2020 standards, but also showcase record‐high maximum external quantum efficiencies nearing 40%, along with suppressed efficiency roll‐off.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a photochemical synthetic route for bandgap engineering of metal halide perovskite quantum dots. Utilizing a material‐efficient microfluidic platform, the underlying mechanism of the photo‐induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER) of metal halide perovskite quantum dots is unveiled and first instance of the PIAER‐enabled synthesis of high‐performing CsPbI3 NCs is reported.








Abstract
Over the past decade, lead halide perovskite (LHP) nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted significant attention due to their tunable optoelectronic properties for next‐generation printed photonic and electronic devices. High‐energy photons in the presence of haloalkanes provide a scalable and sustainable pathway for precise bandgap engineering of LHP NCs via photo‐induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER) facilitated by in situ generated halide anions. However, the mechanisms driving photo‐induced bandgap engineering in LHP NCs remain not fully understood. This study elucidates the underlying PIAER mechanisms of LHP NCs through an advanced microfluidic platform. Additionally, the first instance of a PIAER, transforming CsPbBr3 NCs into high‐performing CsPbI3 NCs, with the assistance of a thiol‐based additive is reported. Utilizing an intensified photo‐flow microreactor accelerates the anion exchange rate 3.5‐fold, reducing material consumption 100‐fold compared to conventional batch processes. It is demonstrated that CsPbBr3 NCs act as photocatalysts, driving oxidative bond cleavage in dichloromethane and promoting the photodissociation of 1‐iodopropane using high‐energy photons. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a thiol‐based additive plays a dual role: surface passivation, which enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield, and facilitates the PIAER. These findings pave the way for the tailored design of perovskite‐based optoelectronic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic‐electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction.








Abstract
Superior properties in organic mixed ionic‐electronic conductors (OMIECs) over inorganic counterparts have inspired intense interest in biosensing, soft‐robotics, neuromorphic computing, and smart medicine. However, slow ion transport relative to charge transport in these materials is a limiting factor. Here, it is demonstrated that hydrophilic molecules local to an interfacial OMIEC nanochannel can accelerate ion transport with ion mobilities surpassing electrophoretic transport by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, ion access to this interfacial channel can be gated through local surface energy. This mechanism is applied in a novel sensing device, which electronically detects and characterizes chemical reaction dynamics local to the buried channel. The ability to enhance ion transport at the nanoscale in OMIECs as well as govern ion transport through local chemical signaling enables new functionalities for printable, stretchable, and biocompatible mixed conduction devices.

Carbon dots are emerging luminescent nanomaterials that have drawn considerable attention due to their abundance, environmental friendliness, and customizable optical properties. However, their susceptibility to temperature‐induced vibrational exciton changes and the tendency to thermal quenching of emission have hindered their practical applications. Here, a method is reported for achieving high‐temperature photoluminescence carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) through a bi‐confinement approach that involves a highly cross‐linked polymer network and a rigid Al2O3 matrix. As the temperature increased from 303 to 500 K, the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission intensities of CPDs@Al2O3 remained virtually unchanged, with the emission duration exceeding 150 h at 500 K. Additionally, CPDs@Al2O3 composites with different degrees of carbonization exhibit dynamic excitation‐dependent photoluminescence properties, which can be patterned for multiple information encryption application. This work provides a concept for designing stable and luminous CPDs under harsh conditions, thus expanding their potential application range.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Soft‐actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) for bidirectional peripheral interfaces enable minimal and secure contact to the nerve through fluid injection‐based soft actuation. A 3D bent structure can grasp and securely contact the nerves with only a little pressure (<1.21 gram‐force). The SACE can achieve negligible damage to the nerve during recording of sensory and motor feedback signals with superior SNR and neuromodulation for long‐term studies.








Abstract
Neural interfaces with embedded electrical functions, such as cuff electrodes, are essential for monitoring and stimulating peripheral nerves. Still, several challenges remain with cuff electrodes because sutured devices can damage the nerve by high pressure and the secured contact of electrodes with the nerve is hard to accomplish, which however is essential in maintaining electrical performance. Here, a sutureless soft‐actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) that can envelop the nerve conveniently by creating a bent shape controlled upon fluid injection, is introduced. Moreover, fluid injection protrudes part of the device where electrodes are formed, thereby achieving minimized, soft but secure contact between the electrodes and the nerve. In vivo results demonstrate the successful recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves over time up to 6 weeks. While securing contact with the nerve, the implanted electrodes can preserve the nerve intact with no reduction in blood flow, thereby indicating only minimal compressive force applied to the nerve. The SACE is expected to be a promising tool for recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves toward bidirectional neuroprostheses.

<title>Robust and Ultra‐Efficient Anti‐/De‐Icing Surface Engineered Through Photo‐/Electrothermal Micro‐Nanostructures With Switchable Solid‐Liquid States</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A robust photo‐/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase‐transition micro‐nanostructures has been developed through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface demonstrates highly efficient, long‐term stable anti‐/de‐icing performance, as well as exceptional superhydrophobicity. A key breakthrough is the resolution of the mechanical interlocking issue, a common challenge for the practical application of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti‐/de‐icing.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces present a promising energy‐saving solution for anti‐/de‐icing, offering effective icing delay and photothermal de‐icing capabilities. However, a significant challenge in their practical application is the mechanical interlocking of micro‐nanostructures with ice formed from condensed water vapor, leading to meltwater retention and compromised functionality post‐de‐icing. Here, a robust photo‐/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase‐transition micro‐nanostructures are demonstrated through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface exhibits ultra‐efficient, long‐term stable anti‐/de‐icing performance and excellent superhydrophobicity, demonstrating an icing delay of ≈ 1250 s, photothermal de‐icing in 8 s, water contact angle of 165°, and sliding angle of 0.2°. Furthermore, the surface maintains efficient anti‐/de‐icing ability and water repellency after 400 linear abrasion cycles under 0.93 MPa. Remarkably, under simulated natural icing conditions, where water vapor freezes within the micro‐nanostructures causing mechanical interlocking, the surface remains entirely non‐wetted after photo‐/electrothermal de‐icing, maintaining superhydrophobicity and effectiveness for continued anti‐/de‐icing. This exceptional performance is attributed to the designed phase‐transition micro‐nanostructures that liquefy during de‐icing, significantly reducing interactions with water molecules, as quantitatively validated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides new perspectives and methodologies for designing and creating innovative, high‐performance anti‐/de‐icing surfaces.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multifunctionality of reentrant microcavity geometries for different materials is investigated, and a novel and efficient method for fabricating such geometry is proposed by analyzing capillary fluid behavior. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods to provide a cost‐effective and high‐throughput solution for generating multifunctional reentrant surfaces, which is expected to be utilized in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to their unique structural robustness, interconnected reentrant structures offer multifunctionality for various applications. a scalable multistep roll‐to‐roll printing method is proposed for fabricating reentrant microcavity surfaces, coined as wetting‐induced interconnected reentrant geometry (WING) process. The key to the proposed WING process is a highly reproducible reentrant structure formation controlled by the capillary action during contact between prefabricated microcavity structure and spray‐coated ultraviolet‐curable resins. It demonstrates the superior liquid repellency of the WING structures, which maintain large contact angles even with low‐surface‐tension liquids, and their robust capability to retain solid particles and liquids under external forces. In addition, the scalable and continuous fabrication approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing a cost‐effective and high‐throughput solution for creating multifunctional reentrant surfaces for anti‐icing, biofouling prevention, and particle capture.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel UV‐induced two‐step thiol‐ene “click chemistry” is introduced for the tailorable fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (T‐PQDs). A protective shell is formed around the PQDs in the first step, while chemical cross‐linking between PQD and thiol‐ene polymer occurs in the second step. The T‐PQDs offer high efficiency, stability, and processability, facilitating their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.








Abstract
In practical applications, fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) must exhibit high efficiency, stability, and processibility. So far, it remains a challenge to synthesize PQDs with stable dispersibility in tailorable monomers both before and after photocuring. In this work, a novel strategy of UV‐induced two‐step thiol‐ene “click chemistry” is proposed to prepare PQDs with these attributes. The first step aims to epitaxially grow a shell around the PQD core to ensure stable dispersibility in a thiol‐ene monomer solution. The second step is to achieve stable dispersibility in the photocured thiol‐ene matrixes for multiform manufacturing processes. The tailorable PQDs (T‐PQDs) not only have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to ≈100% for green emission and over 96% for red emission, but also exhibit remarkable stability under severe conditions, including “double 85” aging, water exposure, and mechanical stress. Moreover, their exceptional processability allows for various processing techniques, including slot‐die coating, inkjet printing, direct‐laser writing, UV‐light 3D printing, nanoimprinting, and spin coating. The high efficiency and stability of T‐PQDs facilitate their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.

Abstract
Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. Bio‐based materials present a potentially more sustainable alternative to synthetic polymers; however, it often do not yet match the performance of synthetic materials. Given the ongoing reliance on high‐performance, high‐environmental‐impact materials, it is essential to ensure their complete recyclability. Aerogels, recognized by IUPAC as one of the top ten emerging technologies, are witnessing rapid market growth in thermal insulation and thermal protection applications. In certain applications, synthetic and composite aerogels exhibit superior performance, particularly under high temperatures. Here, molecular simulation tools are employed to elucidate the interaction forces between polymers and solvents, develop a recycling strategy for polyimide‐based aerogels, and demonstrate their application in thermal protection for firefighter textiles and thermal runaway protection for Li‐ion battery packs. These composites are engineered for disassembly, allowing for the complete recovery of starting materials without any degradation of components after multiple recycling cycles. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D). This unique combination of outstanding performance and excellent recyclability facilitates the sustainable utilization of aerogels in protective clothing, electric mobility, consumer goods, and aeronautics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH is developed for on‐skin health monitoring. By integrating multiple sensing mechanisms in a single hydrogel‐coated PDMS optical fiber (HPOF) at distinct wavelengths, the device achieves simultaneous monitoring of heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real‐time with negligible crosstalk.








Abstract
Stretchable sensors that can conformally interface with the skins for wearable and real‐time monitoring of skin deformations, temperature, and sweat biomarkers offer critical insights for early disease prediction and diagnosis. Integration of multiple modalities in a single stretchable sensor to simultaneously detect these stimuli would provide a more comprehensive understanding of human physiology, which, however, has yet to be achieved. Here, this work reports, for the first time, a stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH. The multimodal sensing abilities are enabled by realization of multiple sensing mechanisms in a hydrogel‐coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) optical fiber (HPOF), featured with high flexibility, stretchability, and biocompatibility. The integrated mechanisms are designed to operate at distinct wavelengths to facilitate stimuli decoupling and employ a ratiometric detection strategy for improved robustness and accuracy. To simplify sensor interrogation, spectrally‐resolved multiband emissions are generated upon the excitation of a single‐wavelength laser, utilizing upconversion luminescence (UCL) and radiative energy transfer (RET) processes. As proof of concept, this work demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous monitoring of the heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real‐time, with only a single sensor.

<title>An Adaptive Metal–Organic Framework Discriminates Xylene Isomers by Shape‐Responsive Deformation</title>

<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413506?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A shape‐responsive MOF is employed to discern subtle shape differences among xylene isomers. The adsorbent deforms adaptively to match the shapes of isomer molecules, translating these diverse shapes into characteristic deformation energies. With “adaptive fitting” mechanism, where deformation energy scales with the mismatch between molecular shape and pore geometry, the adsorbent energetically favors PX over other isomers, thereby achieving energy‐sieving of xylene isomers.









Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers, especially para‐xylene, is a crucial but challenging process in the chemical industry due to their similar molecular dimensions. Here, a flexible metal–organic framework, Ni(ina)2, (ina = isonicotinic acid) is employed to effectively discriminate xylene isomers. The adsorbent with adaptive deformation accommodates the shapes of isomer molecules, thereby translating their subtle shape differences into characteristic framework deformation energies. Through a combination of multiple local flexibility behaviors, Ni(ina)2 exhibits guest‐specific structural transformations that energetically favor para‐xylene over other isomers. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction, in situ powder X‐ray diffraction, and theoretical investigations validate this “adaptive fitting” mechanism, where the degree of structural deformation scales with the mismatch between the molecular shape and pore geometry. As a result, Ni(ina)2 achieves exceptional para‐xylene selectivity in both liquid and vapor phase separations, maintaining a high para‐xylene purity and productivity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy of exploiting framework flexibility to address challenging molecular separations and provides fresh insights into the design of selective adsorbents.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review examines the critical role of multi‐scale hierarchical structures, from molecular to macro levels, in optimizing light harvesting and photothermal efficiency in solar steam generation (SSG) systems. By tailoring materials and structures to enhance light absorption, manage thermal properties, and support effective water transport, these integrated designs advance solar‐thermal desalination as a sustainable solution to water scarcity.








Abstract
Solar steam generation (SSG) presents a promising approach to addressing the global water crisis. Central to SSG is solar photothermal conversion that requires efficient light harvesting and management. Hierarchical structures with multi‐scale light management are therefore crucial for SSG. At the molecular and sub‐nanoscale levels, materials are fine‐tuned for broadband light absorption. Advancing to the nano‐ and microscale, structures are tailored to enhance light harvesting through internal reflections, scattering, and diverse confinement effects. At the macroscopic level, light capture is optimized through rationally designed device geometries, configurations, and arrangements of solar absorber materials. While the performance of SSG relies on various factors including heat transport, physicochemical interactions at the water/air and material/water interfaces, salt dynamics, etc., efficient light capture and utilization holds a predominant role because sunlight is the sole energy source. This review focuses on the critical, yet often underestimated, role of hierarchical light harvesting/management at different dimensional scales in SSG. By correlating light management with the structure‐property relationships, the recent advances in SSG are discussed, shedding light on the current challenges and possible future trends and opportunities in this domain.

This review sheds light on the most detrimental nanoscopic phase impurities in FA‐rich perovskite PVs and further, highlights research directions that can mitigate their formation in the final films. The objective is to provide fundamental guidelines for engineering state‐of‐the‐art FA‐rich perovskite absorbers pairing exceptional performance and prolonged device stability.








Abstract
Halide‐perovskite semiconductors have a high potential for use in single‐junction and tandem solar cells. Despite their unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for photovoltaic (PV) applications, it remains unclear whether perovskite solar modules can reach a sufficient operational lifetime. In order to make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) commercially viable, a fundamental understanding of the relationship between their nanostructure, optoelectronic properties, device efficiency, and long‐term operational stability/reliability needs to be established. In this review, the phase instabilities in state‐of‐the‐art formamidinium (FA)‐rich perovskite absorbers is discussed. Furthermore, the concerted efforts are summarized in this prospect, covering aspects from fundamental research to device engineering. Subsequently, a critical analysis of the dictating impact of the nanoscale landscape of perovskite materials on their resulting intrinsic stability is provided. Finally, the remaining challenges in the field are assessed and future research directions are proposed for improving the operational lifetimes of perovskite devices. It is believed that these approaches, which bridge nanoscale structural properties to working solar cell devices, will be critical to assessing the realization of a bankable PSC product.

However, their commercial application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and voltage fading, which can be attributed to transition metal migration, lattice oxygen release, and the toxicity of Mn ions to the anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Recently, the application of LRM cathode in all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) has garnered significant interest, as this approach eliminates the liquid electrolyte, thereby suppressing transition metal crosstalk and solid–liquid interfacial side reactions. This review first examines the historical development, crystal structure, and mechanisms underlying the high capacity of LRM cathode materials. It then introduces the current challenges facing LRM cathode and the associated degradation mechanisms and proposes solutions to these issues. Additionally, it summarizes recent research on LRM materials in ASSBs and suggests strategies for improvement. Finally, the review discusses future research directions for LRM cathode materials, including optimized material design, bulk doping, surface coating, developing novel solid electrolytes, and interface engineering. This review aims to provide further insights and new perspectives on applying LRM cathode materials in ASSBs.

Additionally, the review presents the primary challenges relevant to relatively high cost, complex reaction mechanism, and serious hydrogen evolution, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is widely recognized as a crucial raw material for nitrogen‐based fertilizer production and eco‐friendly hydrogen‐rich fuels. Currently, the Haber–Bosch process still dominates the worldwide industrial NH3 production, which consumes substantial energy and contributes to enormous CO2 emission. As an alternative NH3 synthesis route, electrocatalytic reduction of NOx species (NO3−, NO2−, and NO) to NH3 has gained considerable attention due to its advantages such as flexibility, low power consumption, sustainability, and environmental friendliness. This review timely summarizes an updated and critical survey of mechanism, design, and application of Ru‐based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction. First, the reason why the Ru‐based catalysts are good choice for NOx reduction to NH3 is presented. Second, the reaction mechanism of NOx over Ru‐based materials is succinctly summarized. Third, several typical in situ characterization techniques, theoretical calculations, and kinetics analysis are examined. Subsequently, the construction of each classification of the Ru‐based electrocatalysts according to the size of particles and compositions is critically reviewed. Apart from these, examples are given on the applications in the production of valuable chemicals and Zn−NOx batteries. Finally, this review concludes with a summary highlighting the main practical challenges relevant to selectivity and efficiency in the broad range of NOx concentrations and the high currents, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.

This review article systematically explores the recent advances in the membrane processes for lithium cycling and recovery, offering the first correlation between these technologies and technology readiness levels, unveiling the fundamentals for the lithium separation, and providing insights into the future design of membrane materials from both academic and industrial perspectives.








Abstract
Rapid uptake of lithium‐centric technology, e.g., electric vehicles and large‐scale energy storage, is increasing the demand for efficient technologies for lithium extraction from aqueous sources. Among various lithium‐extraction technologies, membrane processes hold great promise due to energy efficiency and flexible operation in a continuous process with potential commercial viability. However, membrane separators face challenges such as the extraction efficiency due to the limited selectivity toward lithium relative to other species. Low selectivity can be ascribed to the uncontrollable selective channels and inefficient exclusion functions. However, recent selectivity enhancements for other membrane applications, such as in gas separation and energy storage, suggest that this may also be possible for lithium extraction. This review article focuses on the innovations in the membrane chemistries based on rational design following separation principles and unveiling the theories behind enhanced selectivity. Furthermore, recent progress in membrane‐based lithium extraction technologies is summarized with the emphasis on inorganic, organic, and composite materials. The challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of selective membranes for lithium recovery are also pointed out.

<title>Electrical Spin State Manipulation in All‐Magnet Heterojunctions Using a Ferromagnetic Spin Source</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrical manipulation of spins by spin Hall current from heavy metals facilitates the implementation of multifunctional spintronic devices. This work reports direct evidence of spin current generation in ferromagnets via observation of efficient current‐induced switching of noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet structure. The further realization of field‐free switching suggests the ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources.








Abstract
The ability to electrically manipulate spin states in magnetic materials is essential for the advancement of energy‐efficient spintronic device, which is typically achieved in systems composed of a spin source and a magnetic target, where the magnetic state of the target is altered by a charge current. While theories suggest that ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources, direct experimental studies involving only the spin source and target layers have been lacking. Here electrical manipulation of spin states in noncolinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using ferromagnets (Ni, Fe, NiFe, CoFeB) as the spin sources is reported. Both field‐free switching and switching with an assistive field are achieved in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet bilayers, where the switching polarity correlates with the sign of anomalous Hall effect of the ferromagnets. The experimental findings can be accounted for by the presence of spin currents arising from spin‐dependent scattering within the ferromagnets. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of spin‐conversion in ferromagnets, offering an alternative spin source for novel technological applications.

<title>A Novel Matrix‐Free Hyperfluorescent System Based on Anti‐Quenching TADF Host for High Color Purity MR‐TADF Emitters</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202409746?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202409746?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study proposes an advanced design concept for matrix‐free hyperfluorescent systems, utilizing anti‐quenching TADF materials as hosts to overcome aggregation‐induced challenges in traditional MR‐TADF emitters by regulating the energy transfer process. Importantly, this strategy avoids complex chemical modifications of MR‐TADF emitters, making them universal and low‐cost, which will greatly promote the commercialization of hyperfluorescent OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on hyperfluorescent system have attracted widespread attention due to their ability to simultaneously achieve improvements in efficiency, lifetime, and color purity by combining the advantages of high exciton utilization sensitizers and high‐color purity emitters. Traditional hyperfluorescent systems typically involve three or four components and are severely sensitive to the doping concentration (≈0.5 wt%) of a terminal emitter, which inevitably causes high costs and difficulties in reproducibility. Here, a novel design concept for a matrix‐free hyperfluorescent (MFHF) system that employs a combination of an anti‐quenching TADF host and a high color purity MR‐TADF emitter is proposed. This strategy allows traditional concentration‐sensitive MR‐TADF emitters to significantly improve exciton utilization and reduce exciton lifetime at high doping levels, without the need for complex molecular modifications. The OLEDs with binary emissive layer achieve pure‐green emission, a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 30%, and a high maximum power efficiency of 145 lm W−1. The approach offers a straightforward and universal method to achieve anti‐quenching matrix‐free hyperfluorescent OLEDs with high color purity, making them promising for commercial applications in low‐cost ultra‐high‐definition (UHD) displays.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high‐capacity and long‐life of Zn‐sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) battery is developed by a tandem catalytic electrolyte containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. The G4–I2 synergy activates efficient I−/I3− redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn‐ion kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic–inorganic interphase that inducing the generation of the predominant (002) plane.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc–sulfur batteries are a high‐capacity and cost‐effective energy storage technology. However, the performance is plagued by the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides formed during conversion. Here, this issue is addressed by developing aqueous rechargeable Zn‐sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries using tandem catalytic systems, containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. Mechanistic study and experiments reveal that the fully conjugated molecular configurations circumvent the formation of soluble polysulfides and enable reversible co‐storage of H+/Zn2+ with multiple redox‐active centers. The reduced I2 by G4 activates I−/I3− redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn‐ion transfer kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic–inorganic interphase that induces the generation of the predominant (002) plane. The as‐assembled Zn‐SPAN batteries exhibit excellent performances, with a high capacity of 1260.4 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, a high‐rate performance (409.3 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1), and a long cycling stability (81.8% capacity remained over 800 cycles at 2 A g−1). This work takes a crucial step forward in organosulfur compounds accompanied by multi‐electron transfer for the high‐performance aqueous zinc‐ion batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces AZBX (AZn₂BO₃X₂) as a quasi‐vdW layered dielectric for 2D semiconductor devices, offering a wide bandgap (≈5.6 eV) and high dielectric constant (κ = 13.5). KZBB/MoS₂ FETs demonstrate excellent performance, including steep subthreshold swing, high on/off ratio, minimal hysteresis, and low leakage, highlighting AZBX's potential for advanced 2D electronics.









Abstract
The development of dielectrics with atomic planes and van der Waals (vdW) interfaces is essential for enhancing the performance of 2D devices. However, vdW dielectrics often have smaller bandgaps compared to traditional 3D dielectrics, limiting their options. This study introduces AZBX (AZn₂BO₃X₂, where A = K or Rb, X = Cl or Br), a nonlinear deep‐ultraviolet optical crystal, as a quasi‐vdW layered dielectric ideal for 2D electronic devices. Focusing on KZBB, it's excellent dielectric properties, including a wide bandgap, high dielectric constant (high‐κ), and smooth interfaces are demonstrated. When used as the top gate dielectric in a KZBB/MoS₂ field‐effect transistor (FET) with MoS₂ channels and graphene contacts, the device exhibits outstanding performance, with a steep subthreshold swing (≈ 73 mV dec−1), high on/off ratio (≈ 10⁷), negligible hysteresis (0–8 mV), and stable, low leakage current (≈10⁻⁷ A cm−2) before breakdown. This work expands the 2D material and dielectric landscape and highlights the strong potential of AZBX as high‐performance dielectrics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of α‐amino acids with a high glyoxylic acid conversion of ≈100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2% is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C‐N coupling synthesis of α‐amino acids.








Abstract
The synthesis of α‐amino acids via the electrocatalytic C‐N coupling attracted extensive attention owing to the mild reaction conditions, controllable reaction parameters, and atom economy. However, the α‐amino acid yield remains unsatisfying. Herein, the efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of α‐amino acids is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst (adFe‐TiOx/Ti). The desired electrocatalyst composition for the hydrogenation of oxime is screened. The prepared adFe‐TiOx/Ti exhibited a high glyoxylic acid conversion of ≈100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2%. The electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that atomically dispersed Fe (adFe) sites and oxygen vacancies (OVs) enhanced the adsorption of glyoxylic acid (GA), glyoxylic oxime (GO), and nitrate (NO3−). adFe sites further promote the step of H2NO* → H2NOH* in the conversion of NO3− to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the step of NH‐CH2‐COOH* → NH2‐CH2‐COOH* in the reduction of GO to glycine. The coupling pathway and the critical intermediate are revealed by synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SR‐FTIR) spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Additionally, six other α‐amino acids are successfully synthesized by the adFe‐TiOx/Ti, showcasing its versatility in the electrosynthesis of α‐amino acids. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C‐N coupling synthesis of α‐amino acids.

<title>Conjugation Chemistry Markedly Impacts Toxicity and Biodistribution of Targeted Nanoparticles, Mediated by Complement Activation</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202409945?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202409945?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Conjugation chemistries are a critical technology in nanomedicine, enabling precise functionalization of nanoparticle surfaces (e.g., via attachment of targeting moieties). This work investigates how conjugation chemistry impacts nanoparticle‐induced complement activation. The results demonstrate that modern conjugation chemistries, although bio‐orthogonal, are not innocuous and must be chosen with opsonins like complement in mind.









Abstract
Conjugation chemistries are a major enabling technology for the development of drug delivery systems, from antibody‐drug conjugates to antibody‐targeted lipid nanoparticles inspired by the success of the COVID‐19 vaccine. However, here it is shown that for antibody‐targeted nanoparticles, the most popular conjugation chemistries directly participate in the activation of the complement cascade of plasma proteins. Their activation of complement leads to large changes in the biodistribution of nanoparticles (up to 140‐fold increased uptake into phagocytes of the lungs) and multiple toxicities, including a 50% drop in platelet count. It is founded that the mechanism of complement activation varies dramatically between different conjugation chemistries. Dibenzocyclooctyne, a commonly used click‐chemistry, caused aggregation of conjugated antibodies, but only on the surface of nanoparticles (not in bulk solution). By contrast, thiol‐maleimide chemistry do not activate complement via its effects on antibodies, but rather because free maleimide bonded to albumin in plasma, and clustered albumin is then attacked by complement. Using these mechanistic insights, solutions are engineered that reduced the activation of complement for each class of conjugation chemistry. These results highlight that while conjugation chemistry is essential for the future of nanomedicine, it is not innocuous and must be designed with opsonins like complement in mind.

<title>Matrix Viscoelasticity Controls Differentiation of Human Blood Vessel Organoids into Arterioles and Promotes Neovascularization in Myocardial Infarction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel method for differentiating arterioles in human blood vessel organoids is presented. Matrix viscoelasticity for hBVO vessel sprouting is manipulated by synthesizing dynamic and non‐dynamic hydrogels. Dynamic hydrogels stimulate angiogenesis in hBVOs, generate unique smooth muscle cells, and facilitate the formation of arterioles that contribute to neovascularization following a myocardial infarction.








Abstract
Stem cell‐derived blood vessel organoids are embedded in extracellular matrices to stimulate vessel sprouting. Although vascular organoids in 3D collagen I‐Matrigel gels are currently available, they are primarily capillaries composed of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and mesenchymal stem‐like cells, which necessitate mature arteriole differentiation for neovascularization. In this context, the hypothesis that matrix viscoelasticity regulates vascular development is investigated in 3D cultures by encapsulating blood vessel organoids within viscoelastic gelatin/β‐CD assembly dynamic hydrogels or methacryloyl gelatin non‐dynamic hydrogels. The vascular organoids within the dynamic hydrogel demonstrate enhanced angiogenesis and differentiation into arterioles containing smooth muscle cells. The dynamic hydrogel mechanical microenvironment promotes vascular patterning and arteriolar differentiation by elevating notch receptor 3 signaling in mesenchymal stem cells and downregulating platelet‐derived growth factor B expression in ECs. Transplantation of vascular organoids in vivo, along with the dynamic hydrogel, leads to the reassembly of arterioles and restoration of cardiac function in infarcted hearts. These findings indicate that the viscoelastic properties of the matrix play a crucial role in controlling the vascular organization and differentiation processes, suggesting an exciting potential for its application in regenerative medicine.

<title>Chiton‐Inspired Composites Synergizing Strength and Toughness Through Sinusoidal Interlocking Interfaces for Protective Applications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The chiton Lepidozona coreanica wisely uses the sinusoidal interlocking interface to make up for the short board of the cross‐lamellar structures. Inspired by this, a chiton‐inspired composite integrating cross‐lamellar architecture and sinusoidal interlocking interface is proposed. The chiton‐inspired composite has the high strength and toughness under quasi‐static and impact loads, and has promising application prospects in the field of protection.








Abstract
Introducing biological structures into materials design is expected to develop strong and tough structural materials. However, multiple interfaces are introduced simultaneously. They are always the weakest part of load transfer, becoming a critical vulnerability and failure‐prone area. Here, it is the first found that the chiton achieves superior mechanical properties just by incorporating a unique sinusoidal interlocking interface into cross‐lamellar architecture. These special interlocking interfaces make the chiton shell achieve damage delocalization and increase the resistance to crack initiation and propagation. Meanwhile, this “pre‐engineered” path significantly increases the travel path of the cracks and balances the strength and toughness under quasi‐static and impact loading. Inspired by this, a novel chiton‐inspired composite is proposed. Through coupling the cross‐lamellar structures and sinusoidal interlocking interfaces, its strength and toughness are increased by 88% and 107% under quasi‐static loading, as well as by 17.8% and 52.4% under impact loading, respectively. These unusual interfaces make up the weak point of cross‐lamellar structures and provide insights into the longer evolution of structural materials.

<title>Lysosome‐Targeting Protein Degradation Through Endocytosis Pathway Triggered by Polyvalent Nano‐Chimera for AD Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The work achieves the polyvalent binding between receptors and ligands through the regulation of ligand density in nano‐system that functioned with precise drug delivery, thereby successfully triggers the lysosome‐targeting protein degradation through endocytosis pathway. Ultimately, the nano‐degrader realizes Alzheimer's disease therapy by modulating the targeted pathological membrane proteins on the damaged blood‐brain barrier.








Abstract
The excessive up‐regulation of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a well‐known pathological marker, drives the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although lysosome‐targeting protein degradation has emerged as an effective therapeutic modality, the limited lysosome‐sorting efficacy greatly hindered the degradation efficiency of target proteins. Herein, a lysosome‐shuttle‐like nano‐chimera (endoTAC) is proposed based on polyvalent receptor binding mode for enhanced RAGE degradation as well as precise drug delivery. The endoTAC shows a high affinity to RAGE and enhances RAGE degradation due to its polyvalent‐interaction with RAGE. Additionally, endoTAC features increased accumulation in diseased brain and shows promise as a precise brain delivery system. After loading with simvastatin, the SV@endoTAC proves to successfully reverse pathological features both in vitro and in vivo. The work proposes that the combination of a lysosome‐targeting chimera and an effective drug delivery system can be promising in Alzheimer's disease therapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The electronic flat bands are conducive to the emergence of strongly interacting phases of matter. In this work, by reducing dimensionality into 1D, it is experimentally constructed ideal flat bands, derived from 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, in two phases of phosphorene nanoribbons with a pentagonal nature, by providing direct evidence via the ARPES measurements and atomically resolved STS mapping.








Abstract
Materials with flat bands can serve as a promising platform to investigate strongly interacting phenomena. However, experimental realization of ideal flat bands is mostly limited to artificial lattices or moiré systems. Here, a general way is reported to construct 1D flat bands in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) with a pentagonal nature: penta‐hexa‐PNRs and penta‐dodeca‐PNRs, wherein the corresponding 1D flat bands are directly verified by using angle‐resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the observed 1D flat bands originate from the electronic 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, respectively, as revealed by the combination of bond‐resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, tight‐binding models, and first‐principles calculations. The study demonstrates a general way to construct 1D flat bands in 1D solid materials system, which provides a robust platform to explore strongly interacting phases of matter.

<title>Thermal Annealing for High Performance and Memory Behavior in n‐Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thermal annealing of the n‐type mixed conductor has a profound effect on its crystallinity, enhancing electronic mobility and decreasing water uptake during electrochemical charging. This new microstructure imparts an “ionic memory” behavior to the material. Leveraging the polymer's sensitivity to light, this work demonstrates the first NIR light‐induced conductance modulation of a mixed conductor in an aqueous electrolyte.








Abstract
N‐type organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (n‐OMIECs) struggle to match the performance of p‐type counterparts, particularly in bioelectronics' flagship device, the organic electrochemical transistor. Enhancing n‐type transistor performance typically necessitates the synthesis of new materials. More sustainable post‐synthetic treatments, known to improve organic devices in dry and oxygen‐free conditions, are not applied to n‐OMIECs. This study introduces thermal annealing to enhance n‐OMIECs' electron mobility without sacrificing their ability to take up ionic charges. Annealing increases the crystallinity of p(gNDI‐gT2), the first designed n‐OMIEC, enhancing its transistor performance to compete with new‐generation NDI‐based materials. Annealing reduces passive and in operando electrolyte uptake without compromising the device threshold voltage, keeping the device power demand low. The microstructure obtained by annealing, combined with the film's strong near‐infrared (NIR) absorption and reduced water swelling, enables the creation of a device that retains photocurrent generated upon frequency‐dependent light training. This leads to a microscale, water‐compatible memory device that emulates the learning process of biological neurons triggered by light.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work proposes a high‐throughput single‐cell exosome quantification and phenotyping platform using a gentle and efficient photothermal‐driven chip. It achieves ≈97% single‐cell isolation efficiency in 5 min, enabling precise exosome analysis of breast cancer cell lines and clinical tissues at the single‐cell level, revealing unique exosome secretion characteristics of subgroups, and providing valuable insights for single‐cell exosome analysis in cancer research.








Abstract
Exosomes, functional biomarkers involved in cancer progression, have gained widespread attention for promoting tumor formation, growth, and metastasis. Current bulk exosome detections in bodily fluids enable cancer functional analysis, but average secretion levels from cell populations, losing parent cell information and ignoring exosome heterogeneity from diverse cell subgroups, necessitating an effective platform for analyzing single‐cell exosome functional heterogeneity. Here, a high‐throughput platform is presented, capable of efficient single‐cell isolation and multi‐color exosome phenotype analysis, as well as quantifying trace exosomes secreted by single cells. Photothermal‐driven single‐cell chips achieve significant single‐cell isolation efficiency (≈97%) within 5 min, facilitating the ultra‐high throughput single‐cell exosome analysis. By conducting mass spectrometry and protein interaction of breast cancer exosome phenotypic proteins, key exosome phenotypes are identified. Tens of thousands of single cells from breast cancer cell lines, and clinical tissues are analyzed, revealing various subgroup differences. The study finds more CD44 and EGFR co‐expressing exosome subgroups in breast cancer cell lines, while immune‐evasion PD‐L1 high‐phenotype exosome subgroups are primarily presented in complex tumor microenvironments, especially in HER2‐positive tissues. This platform offers powerful single‐cell isolation, exosome quantification, and phenotypic analysis capabilities, making it a powerful tool for advancing single‐cell exosome analysis in cancer research.

<title>Dimethylamine Bismuth Iodide: A Lead‐Free Perovskite Enabling Ultra‐Sensitive UVC Photodetection with Low Operating Voltage and High Detectivity</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411332?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411332?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A stable lead‐free perovskite, dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI), demonstrates exceptional UVC photodetection. The device exhibits ultralow dark current, high on/off ratio, superior detectivity, and low operating voltage. With high responsivity and external quantum efficiency, DMABI emerges as a promising candidate for high‐performance, low‐cost deep UV photodetectors, outperforming existing materials in key performance metrics.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) are essential for various applications, but traditional materials face challenges in cost, fabrication, and performance. This study introduces dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI) as a promising lead‐free perovskite for UV PDs, particularly in the UVC region. DMABI demonstrates exceptional device parameters, including an ultralow dark current of 0.12 pA at 0.05 V, a high on/off ratio of 7.1 × 104, and a peak detectivity of 3.18 × 1013 Jones. The unique structure of DMABI, with isolated octahedral units, ensures minimal connectivity, significantly reducing dark current. When exposed to high‐energy UV light, carriers gain sufficient energy to hop between octahedrally coordinated bismuth centres, resulting in substantial photocurrent. The small size of the organic cation facilitates efficient charge transfer, contributing to high responsivity (1.46 A W−1) and external quantum efficiency (up to 717%). These results establish DMABI as a superior, low‐cost candidate for UV photodetection, addressing limitations of existing materials. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these characteristics and highlights potential for future advancements in UV PD technology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Near‐field thermophotovoltaics promise high output power from low temperature thermal sources, but demonstrating large area devices has proven challenging. Here a novel epitaxial co‐designed emitter‐cell device fabricated with scalable processes demonstrates 1.2 mW from a 460 °C heat source, a greater than 20‐fold enhancement over the far‐field. Modeling of various cell changes offers a pathway to even higher power.








Abstract
Thermophotovoltaics, devices that convert thermal infrared photons to electricity, offer a key pathway for a variety of critical renewable energy technologies including thermal energy storage, waste heat recovery, and direct solar‐thermal power generation. However, conventional far‐field devices struggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near‐field thermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by leveraging photon tunneling effects. Here a large area near‐field thermophotovoltaic device is presented, created with an epitaxial co‐fabrication approach, that consists of a self‐supported 0.28 cm2 emitter‐cell pair with a 150 nm gap. The device generates 1.22 mW at 460 °C, a 25‐fold increase over the same cell measured in a far‐field configuration. Furthermore, the near‐field device demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far‐field photocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of photon tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests several practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in power density. These results highlight the promise of near‐field thermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.

<title>High Defect Tolerance Breaking the Design Limitation of Full‐Spectrum Multimodal Luminescence Materials</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411532?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411532?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A grossite‐type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, with a high defect tolerance structure, is used to develop single‐component multimodal luminescence materials. Almost all luminescent modes and full‐spectrum emissions are realized by doping this single host. A series of dynamic anti‐counterfeiting devices and digital information encryption technology with temporal and spatial resolution are proposed to show the visualized optical anti‐counterfeiting application.








Abstract
With the development of optical anti‐counterfeiting and the increasing demand for high‐level information encryption, multimodal luminescence (MML) materials attract much attention. However, the discovery of these multifunctional materials is very accidental, and the versatile host suitable for developing such materials remains unclear. Here, a grossite‐type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, characterized by layered and tunnel structure with excellent defect tolerance, is found to meet the needs of various luminescent processes. Almost all luminescent modes, including down/up‐conversion luminescence (DCL/UCL), long persistent luminescence (LPL), mechanoluminescence (ML), and X‐ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL), are realized in this single host. Full‐spectrum (from violet to near‐infrared) photoluminescence and ML as well as multicolor XEOL are achieved by simply changing the doped luminescent center. A series of anti‐counterfeiting devices, including the quasi‐dynamic display of famous paintings, digital information encryption, and multi‐color handwritten signatures, are designed to show the encryption of information in temporal and spatial dimensions. This study clarifies the importance of defect tolerance of the host for the development of MML materials, and provides a unique insight into the cross‐field applications of special functional materials, which is a new strategy to accelerate the development of novel MML materials.

<title>Low‐Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries Achieved by Synergistically Enhanced Screening Li+ Desolvation Kinetics</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411601?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411601?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
On the basis of pore sieving effect toward Li+ desolvation, the intentionally‐introduced polar electron‐donated chemical groups on metal–organic frameworks is developed to further boost Li+ desolvation and Li0 diffusion kinetics under low temperature, achieving uniform lithium distribution without dendrite formation. As a result, the high capacity‐retention ratio of 97% is stabilized under negative/positive ratio of 3.3 and lower temperature surroundings.








Abstract
Lithium metal anode is desired by high capacity and low potential toward higher energy density than commercial graphite anode. However, the low‐temperature Li metal batteries suffer from dendrite formation and dead Li resulting from uneven Li behaviors of flux with huge desolvation/diffusion barriers, thus leading to short lifespan and safety concern. Herein, differing from electrolyte engineering, a strategy of delocalizing electrons with generating rich active sites to regulate Li+ desolvation/diffusion behaviors are demonstrated via decorating polar chemical groups on porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). As comprehensively indicated by theoretical simulations, electrochemical analysis, in situ spectroscopies, electron microscope, and time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry, the sieving kinetics of desolvation is not merely relied on pore size morphology but also significantly affected by the ─NH2 polar chemical groups, reducing energy barriers for realizing non‐dendritic and smooth Li metal plating. Consequently, the optimal cells stabilize for long lifespan of 2000 h and higher average Coulombic efficiency, much better than the‐state‐of‐art reports. Under a lower negative/positive ratio of 3.3, the full cells with NH2‐MIL‐125 deliver a high capacity‐retention of 97.0% at 0.33 C even under −20 °C, showing the great potential of this kind of polar groups on boosting Li+ desolvation kinetics at room‐ and low‐temperatures.

<title>Ru‐OV Site‐Mediated Product Selectivity Switch for Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Achieving high selectivity in overall CO2 photoreduction is crucial for advancing carbon neutrality and sustainable energy development. This study innovatively establishes dual‐functional active sites comprised of adjacent Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies, stabilizing pivotal intermediates while enhancing local mass transport, thereby achieving the selective overall CO2 photoreduction to CH4.








Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) represents a sustainable route for directly converting greenhouse gases into chemicals but poses a significant challenge in achieving high selectivity due to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations during the reaction process. This work establishes Ru‐OV active sites on the surface of TiO2 by anchoring coordination unsaturated Ru single‐atoms, which stabilize crucial reaction intermediates and facilitate local mass transfer to achieve dual optimization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Combining operando spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates that oxygen vacancies (OV) inhibits the desorption of *CO, whereas Ru facilitates proton extraction. This configuration not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier but has also been engineered to serve as a selectivity switch, changing the reaction route to produce CH4 instead of CO. Consequently, the Ru‐OV/TiO2 exhibits a 195.4‐fold improvement in the CH4 yield compared to TiO2, accompanied by an increase in selectivity to 81%.

<title>Mechanism of Hot‐Carrier Photoluminescence in Sn‐Based Perovskites</title>

Schematic illustrating the two dominant processes in tin‐iodide perovskites at the band edge: 1) Filling of carriers at the band edge extrema as they cool. 2) Cooling of carriers emitting a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon. The inset shows the dephasing of a longitudinal optical phonon studied by impulsive vibrational spectroscopy in this work.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptionally slow hot‐carrier cooling, which has been attributed to various physical mechanisms without reaching a consensus. Here, experiment and theory are combined to unveil the carrier cooling process in formamidinium (FA) and caesium (Cs) tin triiodide thin films. Through impulsive vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, much shorter phonon dephasing times of the hybrid perovskite, which accounts for the larger blueshift in the photoluminescence seen at high excitation density for FASnI3 compared to CsSnI3 is reported. Density functional theory investigations reveal that the largest contribution to the blueshift is accounted by a giant, dynamic band‐filling effect in Sn‐based perovskites, which in turn can explain the cooling disparity with the Pb‐based counterparts. Several years after the first experimental observations, here a deeper understanding of the cooling mechanism of these materials is provided. Design principles for hot‐carrier materials, which may be useful for future implementations of hot‐carrier solar cells are further provided.

<title>MXene‐Vitrimer Nanocomposites: Photo‐Thermal Repair, Reinforcement, and Conductivity at Low Volume Fractions Through a Percolative Voronoi‐Inspired Microstructure</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study unveils MXene‐vitrimer nanocomposites with a distinct biphasic Voronoi‐inspired microstructure, where a percolative MXene minor‐phase spans throughout a vitrimer major‐phase. Fabricated via a streamlined three‐step process of precipitation polymerization, MXene aqueous coating, and melt‐pressing, these nanocomposites deliver photo‐thermal repairability, mechanical reinforcement, and conductivity at low loadings, achieving greatly diminished percolation thresholds and multifunctionality for advanced smart materials and sustainable composites.








Abstract
An innovative process to multifunctional vitrimer nanocomposites with a percolative MXene minor phase is reported, marking a significant advancement in creating stimuli‐repairable, reinforced, sustainable, and conductive nanocomposites at diminished loadings. This achievement arises from a Voronoi‐inspired biphasic morphological design via a straight‐forward three‐step process involving ambient‐condition precipitation polymerization of micron‐sized prepolymer powders, aqueous powder‐coating with 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tz), and melt‐pressing of MXene‐coated powders into crosslinked films. Due to the formation of MXene‐rich boundaries between thiourethane vitrimer domains in a pervasive low‐volume fraction conductive network, a low percolation threshold (≈0.19 vol.%) and conductive polymeric nanocomposites (≈350 S m−1) are achieved. The embedded MXene skeleton mechanically bolsters the vitrimer at intermediate loadings, enhancing the modulus and toughness by 300% and 50%, respectively, without mechanical detriment compared to the neat vitrimer. The vitrimer's dynamic‐covalent bonds and MXene's photo‐thermal conversion properties enable repair in minutes through short‐term thermal treatments for full macroscopic mechanical restoration or in seconds under 785 nm light for rapid localized surface repair. This versatile fabrication method to nanocoated pre‐vitrimer powders and morphologically complex nanocomposites is compatible with classic composite manufacturing, and when coupled with the material's exceptional properties, holds immense potential for revolutionizing advanced composites and inspiring next‐generation smart materials.

<title>Spatiotemporal Nano‐Regulator Unleashes Anti‐Tumor Immunity by Overcoming Dendritic Cell Tolerance and T Cell Exhaustion in Tumor‐Draining Lymph Nodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces a novel nano‐regulator (DNR) engineered to reprogram dendritic cells (DCs) within tumor‐draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), significantly enhancing anti‐tumor immunity. The DNR employs a dual TLR activation strategy, simultaneously mitigating immune checkpoint suppression. This targeted approach directly addresses DC tolerance and T cell exhaustion, effectively restoring robust anti‐tumor responses.








Abstract
Lymph nodes are crucial immune foci as the primary target for cancer immunotherapy. However, the anti‐tumor functions of tumor‐draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are critically suppressed by tumors. Here, a novel spatiotemporal nano‐regulator is presented, designed to modulate the dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, establishing a supportive niche for immune surveillance. The DC‐mediated nano‐regulator (DNR) is established by the self‐assembly of an imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) prodrug, inhibitory immune checkpoint (ICP) siRNA, and mannan (a TLR4 agonist). This unique design leverages the spatiotemporal activation of TLR4 and TLR7/8, thereby optimizing DC maturation and cytokine production. This further promotes efficient T cell priming. Simultaneously, the ICP‐targeting siRNA mitigates the tolerogenic effects induced by tumor‐derived factors and TLR activation, preventing T cell exhaustion. In essence, DNR facilitates potent remodeling of TDLNs and the tumor microenvironment, activating the anti‐tumor immunity cascade. When combined with vaccines, DNR greatly promotes tumor regression and the establishment of long‐term immunological memory.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is presented, utilizing gold nanoparticle aggregates (AuNAs) with an impressive photothermal efficiency of up to 92.8%. This strategy employs low‐power LED irradiation to achieve complete tumor eradication while enhancing safety and immune responses. The findings indicate that this approach has significant potential for improving cancer treatment outcomes and expanding the applicability of photothermal therapy.








Abstract
For millennia, humans have harnessed thermal energy to treat cancer. However, delivering energy to tumor tissues in traditional hyperthermia remains a significant challenge. Nanotechnology has revolutionized this approach, enabling nanomaterials to target tumors precisely and act as internal heat sources. Nanomaterial‐based photothermal therapy employs nano‐photothermal agents to absorb near‐infrared light and convert it into heat, offering non‐invasive, highly controllable, and specific treatment for solid tumors. Nonetheless, achieving complete tumor eradication, preventing recurrence, and ensuring safety continue to be major concerns. To address these issues, sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is proposed, utilizing gold nanoaggregates (AuNAs) with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (92.8%) in combination with a single irradiation of low‐power (∼0.1 W cm−2) sustained LED light. This method achieved complete tumor eradication in animal models, with no recurrence over long‐term (>180 days) monitoring. This strategy provides superior therapeutic effects compared to mild photothermal therapy and higher safety than high‐temperature photothermal therapy. Additionally, it induces a strong immune response and immune memory, crucial for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This novel approach to photothermal therapy may significantly impact clinical applications for shallow tumor treatment and offer new avenues for immunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Numerous superblacks are fabricated via generally suspending individual light‐absorbing nanoparticles in man‐made solid smoke.








Abstract
Current strategies for constructing sparse nanostructures for fabricating superblacks are only suitable for a few light‐absorbing materials, severely limiting their applications. Herein, ultra‐low reflective silica aerogels with ultra‐high light transparency are used as solid smokes to individually or simultaneously suspend at least 100 species of light‐absorbing nanoparticles with a volume fraction as low as 0.005%, for creating > 100 superblacks in practice and one billion superblacks in theory if taken permutation and combination among these 0D, 1D, or 2D nanoparticles into account. Depending on the composition of suspended nanoparticles and the structure of solid smoke, the resulting mechanically robust superblacks with supplementary properties including magnetism, full‐spectrum absorption, high thermal stability, and excellent mechanical strength, are first observed. The wide choice of metallic or semiconductive LNs allows as‐made superblacks to glitter in different catalytic reactions, and the resulting superblacks have been on‐demand modified for endowing the self‐cleaning performance in some contaminable environments. Benefiting from the superblack feature and porous network, these superblack monoliths have shown high‐efficiency solar‐heat conversion in some emerging light harvesting and managing fields. This powerful synthetic strategy for superblacks is expected to inspire researchers to conduct in‐depth investigations on super‐black optics, functional materials, etc.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Porous ceramics colonized by bacteria can achieve self‐regulated, programmable carbon capture and gas‐sensing functions. The porosity of the ceramic scaffold enables autonomous nutrient transport through capillary forces, enabling microbial growth without external energy. Using wild‐type cyanobacteria and engineered E. coli, living porous ceramics are created to capture CO2 directly from the air and convert toxic gases into human‐detectable benign scents.








Abstract
Microorganisms hosted in abiotic structures have led to engineered living materials that can grow, sense, and adapt in ways that mimic biological systems. Although porous structures should favor colonization by microorganisms, they have not yet been exploited as abiotic scaffolds for the development of living materials. Here, porous ceramics are reported that are colonized by bacteria to form an engineered living material with self‐regulated and genetically programmable carbon capture and gas‐sensing functionalities. The carbon capture capability is achieved using wild‐type photosynthetic cyanobacteria, whereas the gas‐sensing function is generated utilizing genetically engineered E. coli. Hierarchical porous clay is used as a ceramic scaffold and evaluated in terms of bacterial growth, water uptake, and mechanical properties. Using state‐of‐the‐art chemical analysis techniques, the ability of the living porous ceramics are demonstrated to capture CO2 directly from the air and to metabolically turn minute amounts of toxic gas into a benign scent detectable by humans.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The synthesized Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH achieves ultrafast decontamination of nerve and blister agents under ambient conditions with the synergistic effect of Zr4+ and bridging/terminal hydroxyl in the laminates and OH− in the interlayers, remarkably sets the record for the shortest decontamination half‐life for DECP and GD. Further, self‐detoxifying protective fibers are prepared using Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH as a catalytic component.








Abstract
Developing materials capable of rapidly decontaminating nerve and blister agents directly under ambient conditions are crucial for practical applications. In this work, Mg3Al1‐xZrx‐LDH with different Zr4+ doping contents and corresponding OH− intercalated materials Mg3Al1‐xZrx‐LDH‐OH are synthesized. First, they are used for the decontamination of nerve agents under ambient conditions, showing that increasing the Zr4+ doping amount accelerates the decontamination rate of diethyl cyanophosphonate (DECP) and soman (GD), with the half‐life of DECP and GD being 3–5 times shorter with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH (the highest Zr4+ doping content) compared to Mg3Al1‐LDH. Notably, the intercalation of OH− in Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH further greatly enhances the catalytic activity for DECP and GD, the reaction half‐life of DECP and GD with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH being 18 s and <15 s, respectively, which is the shortest recorded so far. Additionally, under ambient conditions, Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH exhibits superior detoxification performance for mustard gas (HD) compared to Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH, with 92.8% of HD being removed within 6 h. Mechanistic studies reveal that Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH efficiently decontaminates nerve and blister agents utilizing the synergistic effect of Lewis acid‐base sites (Zr4+ and laminate OH groups) and interlayer OH−. To extend the practical applications of the materials, PVA@(PAN/LDH‐OH) self‐detoxifying fiber loaded with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH is prepared.

<title>Enhance Photo‐Stability of Up‐Scalable Organic Solar Cells: Suppressing Radical Generation in Polymer Donors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Organic solar cells with a wide thickness range fabricated by doctor‐blade with non‐halogenated solvents in air show strong losses in short‐circuit current density under photo‐thermal stress. Suppressing radical generation in polymer donors processed in air by increasing the crystallinity in unit thickness is critical for enhancing photo‐stability of up‐scalable organic solar cells.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single‐junction organic solar cells (OSCs) has been promoted above 20%. Device up‐scaling draws more and more research attentions. Besides the high PCE for devices with up‐scalable fabrication methods and conditions, achieving high stability simultaneously is essential for pushing industrialization of this technology. Here, the stability of the state‐of‐the‐art OSCs blade‐coated in air with non‐halogenated solvents in a wide thickness range is thoroughly investigated. The losses in short‐circuit current density under photo‐thermal stress strongly depend on processing conditions. Devices with less crystalline phases in unit thickness show faster generation of trap states and hence strongly reduced charge collection efficiency. Through in‐depth photo‐chemical, photo‐physical, and morphological characterizations during ageing, faster generation of radicals in PM6 for active layers with more amorphous structures is identified as the cause for device degradation. Increasing the crystallinity of active layer films for suppressing radical generation in polymer donors is critical to enhance the photo‐thermal stability of devices processed in air with a wide thickness range.

This work describes a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)‐releasing nanocarriers that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds impose significant physical and mental burdens on patients. Nano‐based formulations offer a promising strategy for chronic wound healing due to their non‐invasive nature and enhanced biofilms penetration, but they often lack targeting capability or fail to achieve long‐term and synergistic effects. In this work, a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)‐releasing nanocarriers are presented that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds. With the assistance of MNs, the nanoparticles (NPs) can directly cross bacterial biofilms and be efficiently delivered to wound tissues, where they target harmful bacteria through the specific recognition between Con A and polysaccharides on bacterial surfaces, followed by the release of the encapsulated antimicrobial agent, thereby achieving effective antibacterial effect. Moreover, the NPs generate NO in a sustained manner as they dissociate in the wound tissue, which exerts potent anti‐inflammatory action and benefits tissue regeneration, further promoting chronic wounds closure. Consequently, this work provides a novel MN patch loaded with engineered NPs designed for accelerating chronic wound healing through targeted and synergistic therapy.

<title>Thiol Carbazole Self‐Assembled Monolayers as Tunable Carrier Injecting Interlayers for Organic Transistors and Complementary Circuits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thiol‐based carbazole self‐assembled monolayers are synthesized and used to tune the work function of gold electrodes from 4.52 to 5.48 eV, making them suitable for application as hole or electron injecting contacts in organic thin‐film transistors. Using these thiol‐based monolayers, p/n‐channel organic transistors and complementary inverters are demonstrated.








Abstract
The significant contact resistance at the metal‐semiconductor interface is a well‐documented issue for organic thin‐film transistors (OTFTs) that hinders device and circuit performance. Here, this issue is tackled by developing three new thiol carbazole‐based self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules, namely tBu‐2SCz, 2SCz, and Br‐2SCz, and utilizing them as carrier‐selective injection interlayers. The SAMs alter the work function of gold electrodes by more than 1 eV, making them suitable for use in hole and electron‐transporting OTFTs. Scanning tunneling microscopy analysis indicates that 2SCz and Br‐2SCz form highly ordered molecular rows, resulting in work function values of 4.86 and 5.48 eV, respectively. The latter value is higher than gold electrodes modified by the commonly used pentafluorobenzenethiol (≈5.33 eV), making Br‐2SCz promising for hole injection. Conversely, tBu‐2SCz appears disordered with a lower work function of 4.52 eV, making it more suitable for electron injection. These intriguing properties are leveraged to demonstrate hole‐ and electron‐transporting OTFTs with improved operating characteristics. All‐organic complementary inverters are finally demonstrated by integrating p‐ and n‐channel OTFTs, showcasing the potential of this simple yet powerful contact work function engineering approach. The present study highlights the versatility of thiol carbazole SAMs as carrier injecting interlayers for OTFTs and integrated circuits.

<title>Size‐Dependent Multiexciton Dynamics Governs Scintillation From Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quantum‐confined nano scintillators are gaining interest in radiation detection. Understanding the nanoscale scintillation mechanism and key material parameters is crucial. These open questions are addressed by studying the scintillation of CsPbBr3 quantum dots. Increasing the particle size increases the energy deposition, the (multi‐)exciton population, and the emission yield, resulting in maximized scintillation efficiency and timing. A validated theoretical model for the scintillation yield and kinetics is developed, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.








Abstract
The recent emergence of quantum‐confined nanomaterials in the field of radiation detection, in particular lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, offers scalability and performance advantages over conventional materials. This development raises fundamental questions about the mechanism of scintillation itself at the nanoscale and the role of particle size, arguably the most defining parameter of quantum dots. Understanding this is crucial for the design and optimization of future nanotechnology scintillators. In this work, these open questions are addressed by theoretically and experimentally studying the size‐dependent scintillation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and radiometric techniques. The results show that the simultaneous effects of size‐dependent energy deposition, (multi‐)exciton population, and light emission under ionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the scintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to greater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The agreement between theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals without free parameters, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.

<title>A Mitochondrion‐Targeting Piezoelectric Nanosystem for the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction via Autophagy Regulation</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413287?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413287?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here, the study proposes a mitochondrion‐targeted piezoelectric nanosystem that can promote mitophagy and ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice through ultrasound‐assisted electric current generation and long‐acting glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) release, respectively. The findings reveal that this nanosystem can be employed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.








Abstract
Mitochondrial damage caused by external stimuli, such as high glucose levels and inflammation, results in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Existing antioxidants can only scavenge ROS and cannot address the root cause of ROS production, namely, abnormal mitochondria. To overcome this limitation, the study develops a piezoelectric synergistic drug‐loaded nanosystem (BaTCG nanosystem) that targets mitochondria. The BaTCG nanosystem is delivered to mitochondria via triphenylphosphine modification, and generates current under the stimulation of ultrasound, thereby promoting mitochondrial autophagy and restoring mitochondrial  homeostasis. In a model of diabetes‐related erectile dysfunction (ED), the BaTCG nanosystem, through the current induced by the piezoelectric effect, not only promoted mitophagy, thereby reducing ROS production, but also released long‐acting glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) to effectively reduce blood glucose levels and mitochondrial damage. Each component of this nanosystem functions individually as well as synergistically, thus facilitating corpus cavernosum repair and restoring erectile function. In conclusion, the findings offer a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes‐related ED and a target for the treatment of diabetes‐related conditions with functionalized nanoparticles to regulate mitophagy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Functionalized nanozyme microcapsules are established to protect cisplatin‐induced hearing loss via mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed microcapsules reprogram the energy supply mechanism and inhibit the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction, which is the primary mechanism underlying cisplatin‐induced hearing loss, can potentially be mitigated by modulating the redox balance and reprogramming the energy metabolism to remodel mitochondrial homeostasis. Herein, N‐acetyl‐l‐cysteine–derived carbonized polymer dots (NAC CPDs) are embedded into manganese porphyrin–doped metal–organic frameworks and encapsulated using a polydopamine (PDA) coating and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to afford functionalized nanozyme microcapsules. Owing to their injectability and adhesion properties, these microcapsules exhibit the advantages of prolonged retention in the middle ear and sustained release in the inner ear. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed nanozymes activate the PI3K‐AKT pathway, reprogramming the energy supply mechanism, and inhibiting the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c. Therapeutic efficacy and related mechanisms are validated in vivo. Thus, this study on mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling by nanozyme microcapsules opens a new chapter in the treatment of hearing loss.

<title>Xolography for 3D Printing in Microgravity</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413391?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413391?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Xolography can 3D print versatile plastic and hydrogel parts in microgravity and a variety of resins can be processed independent from viscosity and flow properties. Just like on Earth, complex geometries, smooth surfaces and feature resolution down to 20 µm can be achieved during 20 s microgravity phases in a parabolic flight experiment.








Abstract
Xolography is a volumetric 3D printing technique utilizing intersecting light beams within a volume of photopolymer for a spatially controlled photopolymerization. Unlike layer‐based methods, Xolography creates structures continuously within a closed photopolymer vat, eliminating the prevalent need for support structures and allowing full geometrical freedom at high printing speeds. The volumetric working principle does not rely on gravity, making Xolography an outstanding technology for additive manufacturing under microgravity conditions as illustrated in a set of experiments during a parabolic flight campaign. The microgravity environment obviates the need for rheology control of resins, enabling the use of low‐viscosity formulations (e.g., 11 mPa s) while maintaining the fast and precise 3D printing of acrylic polymer resins and hydrogels. Xolography's speed and reliability facilitate rapid iterations of a print task between Earth's gravity and microgravity conditions. This capability positions Xolography as an ideal tool for material research and manufacturing in space, offering significant cost and efficiency advantages over traditional methods.

<title>Self‐Selective (220) Directional Grown Copper Current Collector Design for Cycling‐Stable Anode‐Less Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413420?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413420?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A self‐selective, preferentially Li salt‐adsorbing and inorganic interphase‐catalyzing copper current collector (CuCC) design is developed by incorporating Li salt into CuCC fabrication process to self‐select out its salt‐philic facet growth. This self‐selected Cu(220) facet‐dominant CuCC exhibits high selectivity and catalyzation ability for Li salt adsorption, decomposition, and inorganic interphase formation over other facets, reducing the electrode degradation speed by 33–42%.









Abstract
Anode‐less lithium metal batteries (ALLMB) are promising candidates for energy storage applications owing to high‐energy‐density and safety characteristics. However, the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on anode copper current collector (CuCC) leads to poor reversibility of uneven lithium deposition/stripping. Though the well‐known knowledge of lithium salt‐derived inorganic‐rich SEI (iSEI) benefiting uniform lithium deposition, how to design a lithium salt‐philic CuCC with undiscovered salt‐philic facet that favors lithium salt adsorption and catalyzing salt decomposition into iSEI, remains unexplored yet. Here, a self‐selective and iSEI‐catalyzing CuCC design is developed by using lithium salt as surface‐controlling agent in CuCC electrodeposition process, self‐selecting out and guiding unidirectional Cu(220) facet growth as the most salt‐philic facets of CuCC. This self‐selected Cu(220) facet promotes the salt adsorption and formation of salt decomposition‐derived iSEI in battery, thus improving the lithium plating/stripping coulombic efficiency from 99.25% to 99.50% (stable within 400 cycles), and the capacity decay rate of ALLMB is also reduced by 42.4% within 100 cycles. Practical mass‐productivity of this self‐selective CuCC for 350 Wh kg−1 pouch‐cell fabrication is also demonstrated, providing a new self‐selective current collector design strategy for improving selectivity and catalyzation of desired chemical reaction, important for high‐selectivity electrochemical reaction system construction.

<title>High‐Temperature Diffusion Enabled Epitaxy of the Ti–O System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thin‐film epitaxy of the Ti–O system at ultra‐high temperatures realizes an unconventional growth mode. Above 1000 °C, oxygen diffusion from the substrates governs the growth dynamics and the resulting growth phase diagram appears to be against basic thermodynamics. The growth temperature selectively stabilizes the oxidation state of the Ti–O system, which demonstrates a novel self‐regulated growth of epitaxial oxides.








Abstract
High temperatures promote kinetic processes that can drive crystal synthesis toward ideal thermodynamic conditions, thereby realizing samples of superior quality. While accessing very high temperatures in thin‐film epitaxy is becoming increasingly accessible through laser‐based heating methods, demonstrations of such utility are still emerging. The study realizes a novel self‐regulated growth mode in the Ti–O system by relying on thermally activated diffusion of oxygen from an oxide substrate. The controlled diffusion enables oxidation state selectivity of single‐phase films with superior crystallinity to conventional approaches as evidenced by structural and electronic measurements. The diffusion‐enabled epitaxy is potentially of wide use in the growth of transition metal oxides, opening up new opportunities for ultra‐high purity epitaxial platforms based on d‐orbital systems.

Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 high‐entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles (NPs) are supported in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon farmwork and demonstrated as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction in ammonia synthesis. The multi‐sites of the HEI NPs synergistic for a tandem reduction mechanism, where the Pt‐Fe/Co/Ni/Cu bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key NOx while the Pt sites facilitate the generation of *H species.









Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3
−RR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a significant technological advancement, yet it involves a cascade of elementary reactions alongside various intermediates. Thus, the development of multi‐site catalysts for enhancing NO3
−RR and understanding the associated reaction mechanisms for NH3 synthesis is vital. Herein, a versatile approach is presented to construct platinum based high‐entropy intermetallic (HEI) library for NH3 synthesis. The HEI nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly supported on a 2D nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (N‐mC) framework, featured with adjustable compositions (up to eight elements) and a high degree of atomic order (over 90%). Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and atomic structural analysis, a quinary Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 HEI NPs based N‐mC catalyst is designed, which demonstrates a large ammonia Faradaic efffciency (>97%) and a remarkable recyclability (>20 cycles) under both acidic and basic conditions. The combined in situ experimental analysis and further DFT calculation suggests that the well‐defined multi‐sites nature of the HEI NPs cooperate for a tandem reduction mechanism, in which the Pt‐X (X represents the other four transition elements) bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key nitrogen–oxygen species while the Pt sites facilitate the generation and adsorption of *H species.

<title>Polyphenol Mediated Assembly: Tailored Nano‐Dredger Unblocks Axonal Autophagosomes Retrograde Transport Traffic Jam for Accelerated Alzheimer's Waste Clearance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Customized Nano‐dredger based on the complex interaction between polyphenol Lithospermic acid B (LA) and various substances, including siRNA, lipid nanovacuoles (LIP), ε‐polylysine (εPLL), achieves efficient brain‐neuron targeting, enhances the operability and patency of axonal autophagosome retrograde transport and autolysosomal fusion‐degradation process, thereby decreasing Alzheimer's disease (AD)‐related neuronal waste burden (aberrant accumulated protein/aging organelle) and achieving neuroprotection.








Abstract
Clear‐cut evidence has linked defective autophagy to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies underscore a unique hurdle in AD neuronal autophagy: impaired retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes, potent enough to induce autophagic stress and neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, pertinent therapy is unavailable. Here, a novel combinational therapy composed of siROCK2 and lithospermic acid B (LA) is introduced, tailored to dredge blocked axonal autophagy by multi‐mitigating microtubule disruption, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and autophagy initiation impediments in AD. Leveraging the recent discovery of multi‐interactions between polyphenol LA and siRNA, ε‐Poly‐L‐lysine, and anionic lipid nanovacuoles, LA and siROCK2 are successfully co‐loaded into a fresh nano‐drug delivery system, LIP@PL‐LA/siRC, via a ratio‐flexible and straightforward fabrication process. Further modification with the TPL peptide onto LIP@PL‐LA/siRC creates a brain‐neuron targeted, biocompatible, and pluripotent nanomedicine, named “Nano‐dredger” (T‐LIP@PL‐LA/siRC). Nano‐dredger efficiently accelerates axonal retrograde transport and lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes, thereby facilitating the clearance of neurotoxic proteins, improving neuronal complexity, and alleviating memory defects in 3×Tg‐AD transgenic mice. This study provides a fresh and flexible polyphenol/siRNA co‐delivery paradigm and furnishes conceptual proof that dredging axonal autophagy represents a promising AD therapeutic avenue.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2⁺ diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, conventional Zn0 dendrite growth suppression strategies are shifted by introducing proactive dendrite‐digesting chemistry via an ion sieve interface. This work provides unique insights into achieving reversible aqueous Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Zn0 dendrite formation during repeated plating/stripping processes limits the practical use of Zn‐metal anodes in reliable and affordable energy storage. Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2+ diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, using an in situ pre‐zincation approach, a Li2ZnxTi3‐xO8 (LZTO, 0<3) layer with uniform ion channels is introduced. This layer acts as an ionic sieve, reviving Zn0 dendrite into Zn2+ through redox reactions and enhancing Zn2+ diffusion kinetics. Experiment and simulation results reveal that Zn2+ migrates along the (111) crystal plane of LZTO through the successive replacement of Zn atoms in tetrahedral positions, with a high transference number of 0.796. LZTO@Zn performs better in coin cells at high currents (e.g., 50 mA cm−2) and operates at higher Zn utilization (300 h at 56.98% Zn utilization), with four times the lifespan at −40 °C and six times longer in alkaline electrolytes compared to bare Zn. Pouch cells with LZTO@Zn anodes operate in a low N/P ratio (6.9) and lean electrolyte (E/C is 20 µL mA h−1), achieving enhanced cycling stability. The findings indicate the significance of ion sieves with ordered ion channels in mitigating Zn0 dendrites and promoting rapid Zn2+ transport.

<title>Inverse Size‐Scaling Ferroelectricity in Centrosymmetric Insulating Perovskite Oxide DyScO3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In centrosymmetric DyScO3, nanoscale thickness gradient‐induced nonpolar‐polar transition is observed by atomically‐resolved electron microscopy. Driven by surface charge transfer, the asymmetric Dy‐Dy split and ferrodistortive octahedral order break the inversion symmetry. The inverse size‐scaling ferroelectricity, prevailing in many perovskites with alternatively charged AOn+ and BO2n− (n ≠ 0) layers, opens up a new era for novel ferroelectric study at low dimension.








Abstract
The breaking of inversion symmetry dictates the emergence of electric polarization, whose topological states in superlattices and bulks have received tremendous attention for their intriguing physics brought for novel device design. However, as for substrate oxides such as LaAlO3, KTaO3, RScO3 (R = rare earth element), their centrosymmetric trivial attributes make their functionality poorly explored. Here, the discovery of nanoscale thickness gradient‐induced nonpolar‐to‐polar phase transition in band insulator DyScO3 is reported by using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. As the free‐standing specimen reduces to a critical thickness ≈5 nm, its inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken by surface charge transfer, which gives rise to asymmetric Dy atomic displacements and ferrodistortive octahedral order, as substantiated by the first‐principles calculations. Apart from the observation of migratable polar vortex structures, the switchable electric polarization by applied electric field is demonstrated by the piezoresponse force microscopy experiments. Given the decisive role of critical size in generating ferroelectricity, a concept of “inverse size‐scaling ferroelectric” is proposed to define a class of such materials. Distinct from the proper and improper ferroelectrics, the findings offer a new platform to explore novel low‐dimensional ferroelectrics and device applications in the future.

<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413751?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel slippery surface is introduced for the enduring separation of viscous water‐in‐oil emulsions through the meticulous construction of a robust, chemically cross‐linked network embedding soft nanomicelles, complemented by the integration of the corrosion‐resistant polystyrene. Ultimately, the coating exhibits outstanding anti‐oil‐adhesion properties (even viscous crude oil), and chemical and mechanical stability, preventing membrane fouling and enabling efficient sustainable high‐viscosity emulsion separation.









Abstract
The demand for efficient separation techniques in industries dealing with high viscosity emulsions has surged due to their widespread applications in various scenarios, including emulsion‐based drug delivery systems, the removal of emulsified impurities in formulations and oil spill remediation. However, membrane fouling is a major challenge for conventional separation methods, leading to decreased efficiency and increased maintenance costs. Herein, a novel approach is reported by constructing liquid‐like surfaces with double anti‐fouling structure, incorporating soft nanomicelles within a rigid, chemically cross‐linked network for both anti‐membrane‐fouling and effective viscous water‐in‐oil emulsion separation. The coating significantly outperforms perfluorinated and commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PVDF) membranes, effectively preventing the adhesion of viscous oils like crude oil and pump oil, and alleviating severe membrane fouling. For high‐viscosity emulsions (97.3 cP and 52.8 cP), it maintains over 99% separation efficiency after 3 h continuous use. Even after 15 h immersion in strong acids, alkalis, salts, or organic solvents, its separation efficiency remains above 95%. In addition, thanks to the anti‐membrane‐fouling ability, this work achieved 6 h continuous emulsion separation performance for the first time, demonstrating unparalleled long‐term stability. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the development of innovative coatings for efficient and eco‐friendly separation of high‐viscosity emulsions.

<title>Sign‐Switchable Poisson's Ratio Design for Bimodal Strain‐to‐Electrical Signal Transducing Device</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An effective and universal strategy for constructing hybrid materials with sign‐switchable Poisson's ratio is developed, enabling the material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. Upon integrating a pre‐stretched silver nanowires film onto its surface, the device can switch its strain‐resistance response between strain‐insensitive and strain‐dependent states due to the varying deformation characteristics.








Abstract
Stretchable electronic devices that conduct strain‐related electronic performances have drawn extensive attention, functioning as mechanical sensors, actuators, and stretchable conductors. Although strain‐insensitive or strain‐responsive nature is well‐achieved separately, it remains challenging to combine these two characteristics in one single device, which will offer versatile adaptability in various working situations. Herein, a hybrid material with sign‐switchable Poisson's ratio (SSPR) is developed by combining a phase‐change gel based reentrantreentrant honeycomb pattern and a polydimethylsiloxane film. The phase‐change gel featuring thermally‐regulated Young's modulus enables the hybrid material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. After integrating with a pre‐stretched silver nanowires film, the obtained stretchable device performs bimodal strain‐to‐electrical signal transducing (Bi‐SET) functions, in which the SSPR‐dominated strain‐resistance response switches between strain‐dependent and strain‐insensitive behaviors. As a proof of concept, a mode‐switchable grasping system is constructed using a Bi‐SET device‐based controller, enabling the adaptation of grasping behaviors to various target objects.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Optically pumped and electrically Q‐switchable minute laser oscillators are invented. The oscillator is made from a robust self‐standing organic droplet that deforms into a prolate spheroid under an electric field. The deformation induces the attenuation of the quality factor, leading to a halt of the laser emission. An array of droplet lasers is also demonstrated as a prototype laser display.








Abstract
Conventional laser panel displays are developed through the mass integration of electrically pumped lasers or through the incorporation of a beam steering system with an array of optically pumped lasers. Here a novel configuration of a laser panel display consisting of a non‐steered pumping beam and an array of electrically Q‐switchable lasers is reported. The laser oscillator consists of a robust, self‐standing, and deformable minute droplet that emits laser through Whispering‐Gallery Mode resonance when optically pumped. The laser oscillation is electrically switchable during optical pumping by applying a vertical electric field to the droplet. Electromagnetic and fluid dynamics simulations reveal the deformation of the droplet into a prolate spheroid under the electric field and associated attenuation of quality factor (Q‐factor), leading to the halt of the laser oscillation. A 2 × 3 array of droplets is fabricated by inkjet printing as a prototype of a laser panel display, and it successfully achieves the pixel‐selective switching of the oscillation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The full‐color QD lasers relevant for practical implementations are achieved. These QD lasers feature the simultaneous metrics of low threshold, long operating duration, and multimilliwatt output power under quasi‐steady‐state pumping. To the best of the available knowledge, the multimilliwatt output power has never been realized in QD lasers before. These results open the door to practical QD lasers.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are attractive gain materials owing to the wide range of accessible colors. However, the existing QD lasers struggle to combine technologically relevant metrics of low threshold and long operating duration with considerable output powers. Here a new class of full‐color QD lasers are reported, featuring low threshold, uninterrupted operation for dozens of hours, and multimilliwatt output under quasi‐steady‐state pumping, by coupling the high‐gain QDs with a double‐clad pumping scheme. Corroborated by the comprehensive transient spectroscopy and numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the ternary QDs with specially designed fine nanostructure enable the low gain threshold, giant gain coefficient, long gain lifetime, and excellent resistance against intense photoexcitation. Meanwhile, the double‐clad QD‐fiber design allows for record‐long light‐gain interaction, high conversion efficiency, and sustained device operation. As such, the QD lasers with multimilliwatt output powers, unobserved in QD lasers to date, have been realized. Further, the proof‐of‐concept application for generating vortex beams with various topological charges is demonstrated. This work represents significant progress toward practical lasers based on QDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hot carrier devices with low‐dimensional semiconductor heterostructures are promising for enhancing photon‐to‐current conversion beyond the Shockley‐Queisser limit. This study presents a 2D Van der Waals heterostructure device made of 2D perovskite quantum wells and few‐layer MoS₂. The device shows efficient gate‐tunable hot‐hole photocurrent and high external quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Hot‐carrier relaxation above the bandgap results in significant energy losses, making the extraction of hot carriers a critical challenge for efficient hot‐carrier photocurrent generation in devices. In this study, we observe long‐lived hot carriers in the metal‐halide perovskite multiple quantum wells, (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3), and demonstrate effective hot‐hole photocurrent generation using 2D MoS₂ as an extraction layer. A high external quantum efficiency of short‐circuit hot‐carrier photocurrent of up to 35.4% is achieved. Further enhancement in photocurrent efficiency and open‐circuit photovoltage is achieved when a gate electric field is applied, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of up to 61.9%. Evidence of hot‐hole extraction is validated through operando transient reflection measurements on the working devices, with studies that depend on wavelength, carrier density, and gate voltage. DFT calculations on the heterostructure devices under different bias voltages further elucidate the mechanism of hot‐hole extraction enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of perovskite multiple quantum wells as long‐lived hot‐carrier generators and highlight the role of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors as efficient hot‐carrier extraction electrodes for low‐power optoelectronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D Cs2Bi3X9 (X = Br, Cl, I) perovskite crystals with variable lattice constants and engineered bandgaps are synthesized via adaptive heteroepitaxy on c‐sapphire substrates. Photodetectors based on these epitaxial crystals exhibit significantly improved photodetection performance, indicating the effectiveness of epitaxial growth strategy for high‐quality crystals. This work advances the integration of multicomponent 2D materials on dielectric substrates for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The heteroepitaxy of 2D materials with engineered bandgaps are crucial to broaden the spectral response for their integrated optoelectronic devices. However, it is a challenge to achieve the high‐oriented epitaxy and integration of multicomponent 2D materials with varying lattice constants on the same substrate due to the limitation of lattice matching. Here, in‐plane adaptive heteroepitaxy of a series of high‐oriented 2D cesium bismuth halide (Cs3Bi2X9, X = I, Br, Cl) single crystals with varying lattice constants from 8.41 to 7.71 Å is achieved on c‐plane sapphire with distinct lattice constant of 4.76 Å at a low temperature of 160 °C in an air ambient, benefiting from tolerable interfacial strain by switching compressive stress to tensile stress during a 30° rotation of crystal orientation. First‐principles calculation demonstrates that those are all thermodynamically stable phases, deriving from multiple minima of interfacial energy between single crystals and sapphire substrate. The detectivity of Cs3Bi2I9 photodetector reaches up to 3.7 × 1012 Jones, deriving from high single‐crystal quality. This work provides a promising experimental strategy and basic theory to boost the heteroepitaxy and integration of 2D single crystals with varying lattice constants on low‐cost dielectric substrate, paving the way for their applications in integrated optoelectronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel exchange‐spring magnetic structure is formed by the coupling of perpendicular CoTb and in‐plane Co films. When a spin current with the y‐polarization flows through this exchange‐spring (x‐z plane) structure, the interaction between the y‐spin and the local exchange field gives rise to unconventional x‐ and z‐ spin polarizations, enabling field‐free spin‐orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching.








Abstract
Manipulating the polarization of spin current is essential for understanding the mechanism of charge‐to‐spin conversion and achieving efficient electrically driven magnetization switching. Here, a novel exchange‐spring magnetic structure is introduced formed by the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) CoTb and in‐plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) Co films. When a spin current with the polarization along the y‐direction flows through this exchange‐spring (x‐z plane) structure, the interaction between the y‐spin and the local exchange field with a non‐collinear spatial distribution gives rise to substantial unconventional spin polarizations in the x‐ and z‐directions, enabling field‐free spin‐orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching at room temperature. More importantly, the polarization directions of this unconventional spin current can be reversed depending on whether the interfacial exchange coupling is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. This work establishes a platform to explore emergent mechanisms for manipulating unconventional spin polarization with rich non‐collinear magnetic exchange spin structures.

<title>Efficient Targeted Regulation of the Interfaces and Bulk in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells With a [closo‐B12H12]2−‐based Derivative</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Post‐treatment involving the incorporation of a novel solution‐processable [closo‐B12H12]2‐ derivative, (TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B), is proposed to simultaneously optimize the interfaces and bulk of inverted perovskite solar cells. TBA2B enhances the power conversion efficiency to 25.59% while improving the stability, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of efficient [closo‐B12H12]2‐‐based interface materials and modification mechanisms.








Abstract
The performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is adversely affected by the recombination loss, ion migration, and residual stress arising from issues within the bulk and at the cathode interface. Using simple post‐treatment with a novel solution‐processable derivative of the dodecahydro‐closo‐dodecaborate anion ([closo‐B12H12]2−)—(TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B)—it is simultaneously address these issues. In inverted PSCs, the cationic and anionic components of TBA2B uniquely self‐separate by positioning themselves precisely to perform their specific modification functions. The majority of [B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH]2‐ anions reside at the (6,6)‐phenyl‐C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag interface, which enhances the electrical and physical contact. Additionally, a substantial fraction of tetrabutylammonium cations diffuse into the perovskite/PCBM heterojunction, enabling comprehensive control over the trap passivation, stress release, ion migration elimination, and grain boundary reinforcement through the in situ formation of 1D TBAPbI3 on the surface of the perovskite crystals. The TBA2B devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 25.59% and open‐circuit voltage of 1.199 V, performance that is among the highest achieved with a solution‐processed perovskite/PCBM heterojunction. Furthermore, TBA2B significantly enhances the device's stability. This study provides crucial insights into the design of efficient and solution processable [closo‐B12H12]2−‐based interface materials, and offers a comprehensive understanding of the underlying modification mechanisms.

<title>Interfacial Metal‐Solvent Chelation for Direct Regeneration of LiFePO4 Cathode Black Mass</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414235?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414235?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To address interfacial challenges in spent LiFePO4 (LFP) black mass, such as structural deterioration and residual impurities, a metal‐solvent chelation strategy leveraging the strong chelation of the Acac− anion is presented. This approach enables effective spent LFP regeneration by surface reconstruction of the degraded LFP with reducing lithium diffusion barriers and enhancing lithium supplementation.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium‐ion batteries presents a promising approach to effectively reuse valuable resources and benefit the environment. Unlike controlled laboratory conditions that commonly facilitate impurity purification and minimize structural damage, the LiFePO4 cathode black mass faces significant interfacial challenges, including structure deterioration, cathode‐electrolyte interphase residues, and damage from storage procedures, which hinder lithium replenishment and structure regeneration. Here, a metal‐solvent chelation reaction using a lithium acetylacetonate solution is introduced to address these challenges under ambient conditions. This method regulates the near‐surface structure through strong chelation between Acac‒ anions and Fe (III) elements, thus effectively eliminating the degraded amorphous phase and residual fluorine compounds. By direct lithium connection and reducing diffusion barriers, the reconstructed surface facilitates the re‐lithiation process. The regenerated LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a capacity retention of 88.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C, while also outperforming traditional recycling methods in terms of environmental and economic benefits. This approach provides a promising solution for regenerating degraded LiFePO4 cathodes from actual dismantled black mass, thereby accelerating the practical application of battery recycling.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Photo‐reactive DNA‐cross‐linked hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo‐reactive DNA crosslinks act as a regulator in morphing of the hydrogels, adjusting the lengths of the cross‐links depending on the wavelength of light. Spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features of the polymorphing hydrogels within a one‐pot system offer advanced solutions for applications in soft robotics and 4D printing.








Abstract
Polymorphing hydrogels can morph into another structure on demand with reprogrammable features. This concept extends the degree of morphing beyond that of traditional shape‐morphing hydrogels, which predetermine their morphing capabilities at the fabrication stage. However, current polymorphing hydrogels face limitations due to the need for complex, non‐sustained responsiveness or additional chemical steps for reconfigurable morphing. Here, photo‐reactive DNA‐cross‐linked polymorphing hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo‐reactive DNA cross‐links act as a regulator in changing the shapes of the hydrogels by adjusting the lengths of the cross‐links depending on the wavelength of light, which allows precise and dynamic morphing in a programmable way through a one‐pot reaction. The high programmability involving spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features offers advanced solutions for multifunctional soft machines and applications requiring complex processes.

Abstract
As the focus on information security continues to intensify, encrypted imaging sensing technology becomes increasingly indispensable. However, the widespread application of encrypted imaging sensing technology is hindered by high manufacturing costs and complex system construction. Herein, an all‐inorganic perovskite/perovskite tandem self‐powered photodetector (PDs) is reported, incorporated with Bi2TeO6 layer to enahnce dual pyro‐phototronic effect, to realize an innovated encryption imaging sensing system with programmable logic gate. The PDs reach responsivity of 1.46 A W−1 and detectivity of 3.44 × 1013 Jones, the corresponding EQE reaches 342%, which is ≈75.48 times greater than that without pyro‐phototronic effect. The outstanding performance resulting from dual pyro‐phototronic effect in Cs2PbI2Cl2 perovskite and Bi2TeO6/CsSn0.5Pb0.5IBr2 interface, and optimizing band arrangement from the oxidized Bi2TeO6 layer. The photovoltaic and pyro‐phototronic signal of PDs can still be clearly distinguished under 8 kHz pulsed laser. More importantly, the encryption imaging sensing system achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate can execute six distinct logical functions, including “OR”, “AND”, “XOR”, “NAND”, “NOR” and “XNOR”. This research not only provides a feasible strategy for realizing the outstanding pyro‐phototronic effect of all‐inorganic perovskite materials, but also presents novel insights for designing encrypted imaging sensing technology.

The Co3O4 nanoparticles are invited to anchor on Fe1‐NC. It is found the spin state of Fe and Co is effectively modulated. Thereby, a boosted ORR and OER performance is achieved for Co3O4@Fe1‐NC proved by 163.1 mW cm−2 in the all‐solid‐state ZAB test.








Abstract
High‐performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the keystone for the industrialization of rechargeable zinc‐air battery (ZAB). In this work, the modulation in the spin state of Fe single atom on nitrogen doped carbon (Fe1‐NC) is devised by Co3O4 (Co3O4@Fe1‐NC), and a mediate spin state is recorded. Besides, the d band center of Fe is downshifted associated with the increment in eg filling revealing the weakened interaction with OH* moiety, resulting in a boosted ORR performance. The ORR kinetic current density of Co3O4@Fe1‐NC is 2.0‐ and 5.6 times higher than Fe1‐NC and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, high spin state is found for Co in Co3O4@Fe1‐NC contributing to the accelerated surface reconstruction of Co3O4 witnessed by operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. A robust OER activity with overpotential of 352 mV at 50 mA cm−2 is achieved, decreased by 18 and 60 mV by comparison with Co3O4@NC and IrO2. The operando Raman reveals a balanced adsorption of OH* species and its deprotonation leading to robust stability. The ZAB performance of Co3O4@Fe1‐NC is 193.2 mW cm−2 and maintains for 200 h. Furthermore, the all‐solid‐state ZAB shows a promising battery performance of 163.1 mW cm−2.

A composition‐graded ferroelectric ScAlN multi‐level memory is demonstrated, showing a storage capacity up to 7‐bit, and one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced operating voltage tuning window compared to uniform composition devices. This approach paves the way for advanced integration of wurtzite ferroelectrics in multifunctional computing systems.








Abstract
Multi‐level non‐volatile ferroelectric memories are emerging as promising candidates for data storage and neuromorphic computing applications, due to the enhancement of storage density and the reduction of energy and space consumption. Traditional multi‐level operations are achieved by utilizing intermediary polarization states, which exhibit an unpredictable ferroelectric domain switching nature, leading to unstable multi‐level memory. In this study, a unique approach of composition‐graded ferroelectric ScAlN to achieve tunable operating voltage in a wide range and attain precise control of domain switching and stable multi‐level memory is proposed. This non‐volatile memory supports multi‐level storage up to 7‐bit capacities, and exhibits enhanced performance compared to the uniform composition device, showing one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced tuning window of operating voltage. Finally, the emulation of long‐term plasticity and linear weight update akin to biological synapse with high uniformity and reliability are demonstrated. The proposed composition‐grading architecture offers new opportunities for next‐generation multi‐level ferroelectric memories, paving the way for advanced hybrid integration in multifunctional computing systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study designes a gradient crown on the side facets of CdSe nanoplatelets to address the issue of high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures. Consequently, a gradient alloyed shell is successfully grown, and the core/crown/shell nanoplatelets exhibited near‐unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high stability. Therefore, the prepared nanoplatelets light‐emitting diodes demonstrates a record‐high external quantum efficiency of 30.1%.








Abstract
Anisotropic nanoplatelets (NPLs) possess strong in‐plane transition dipole moments and out‐of‐plane emission, which enable a maximum photon out‐coupling efficiency of 40% and a high gain coefficient, making them ideal candidates for light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the unbalanced surface energy between the side and top facets of NPLs results in poor thermal stability and high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures, which complicates the growth of the shell. To address this issue, a gradient crown (CdSeS) around the CdSe NPLs is designed to stabilize the high energy side facets. Consequently, the gradient alloyed shell (CdZnS) is successfully grown, and the CdSe/CdSeS/CdZnS core/crown/shell NPLs exhibited near‐unity photoluminescence quantum yield. The CdSeS/CdZnS crown/shell structure suppressed non‐radiative Auger recombinations, achieving a record‐low amplification spontaneous emission threshold of 2.11 µJ cm−2 under femtosecond laser excitation. In addition, by selecting the carrier transport layers with matched energy levels, the NPL‐LEDs demonstrate a record‐high external quantum efficiency of 30.1% in the pure‐red range, driven by the 94% in‐plane transition dipole moment distribution of NPL film. The NPL‐LEDs also exhibited a long operational lifetime of T95 > 600 h at a luminance of 1000 cd m−2.

A self‐floating plasmonic sponge that harvests full‐solar‐spectrum light for highly efficient water purification.








Abstract
Solving the global challenge of freshwater scarcity is of great significance for over one billion people in the world. Solar water evaporation based on plasmonic nanostructures is one of the most promising technologies due to its high efficiency. However, the efficiency of this plasmonic nanostructure‐based technology can hardly achieve 100%. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop new solar converters utilizing plasmonic local heating and reasonable structure design to break the limit of solar‐to‐vapor efficiency for freshwater production. Here, a plasmonic sponge is developed as a solar evaporation converter with excellent full‐solar‐spectrum absorption, good heat localization performance, and fast evaporation kinetics through 3D nanostructures, achieving a 131% solar‐to‐vapor efficiency. Distinct from the traditional 2D localized heating‐based evaporation and nonmetallic 3D water evaporation, the 3D plasmonic sponge can simultaneously achieve highly efficient local heating and super large water–air interfaces for boosting solar‐to‐vapor efficiency. The 3D plasmonic sponge can be also used as a universal converter for purifying seawater, metal ion solutions, organic pollutant solutions, and strong acid and strong alkaline solutions. The full‐solar‐spectrum absorption, high efficiency, and universality in water purification suggest that the novel 3D plasmonic solar converter can bring a significant way to alleviate the crisis of freshwater resources.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Optoelectronic devices integrating visual imaging and recognition functions are achieved by employing 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunction. Through switching bias to modulate carrier and oxygen vacancy dynamics, the device exhibits photodetection property at zero bias and photosynaptic property at negative bias. This work provides a novel strategy to achieve low‐power consumption, easy‐switchable and functional integrated optoelectronic devices for artificial visual system.








Abstract
Optoelectronic devices with imaging and recognition capabilities are crucial for developing artificial visual system (AVS). Bias‐switchable photodetection and photosynaptic devices have been developed using 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunctions. This unique structure allows for modulated carrier dynamics under varied bias conditions, enabling the devices to function as photodetectors without bias and as photosynapses with bias. At zero bias, the device achieves high responsivity (≈0.36 A W−1 at 320 nm) and rapid response speed (0.57 s). Under a −0.5 V bias, it exhibits persistent photoconductivity (PPC), resulting in neuromorphic synaptic behaviors with a paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) index exceeding 300%. Moreover, an 8 × 8 sensor array demonstrates image sensing and memory capabilities, showing in situ enhanced imaging when switching the bias from 0 to −0.5 V, and over 200 s of image memory. The image processing and recognition abilities are further explored by constructing an AVS using a 28 × 28 device array combined with an artificial neural network (ANN). The adjustable synaptic weight under different reverse biases allowed for optimized simulated recognition, achieving an accuracy of 92% after 160 training epochs. This work presents a novel method for creating dual‐functional photodetection and photosynaptic devices, paving the way for a more integrated and efficient AVS.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, B2O3 coating layer is used as a flux for Sb2Se3 recrystallization, inducing a vertical orientation growth of the film while suppressing the defect of Se vacancies. The orientation control and passivation of defects enables efficient transport of carriers, resulting in the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.








Abstract
Crystallization process is critical for enhancing the crystallinity, regulating the crystal orientation of polycrystalline thin films, as well as repairing defects within the films. For quasi‐1D Sb2Se3 photovoltaic materials, the preparation of Sb2Se3 thin films still faces great challenges in adjusting orientation and defect properties, which limits the device performance. In this study, a novel post‐treatment strategy is developed that uses a low melting point B2O3 coating layer as a flux to drive the recrystallization of Sb2Se3, thereby regulating the micro‐orientation of thermal evaporation‐derived Sb2Se3 films and optimizing their electrical properties. Mechanistic investigations show that B2O3 exhibits stronger adsorption with (hk1) planes of Sb2Se3 to induce a vertical orientation growth of the film, while blocking the volatilization channels of Se and inhibiting Se vacancy defects by interacting with Sb2Se3. The Sb2Se3 film with [hk1] preferential orientation and suppressed deep‐level defects promotes the effective transport of charge carriers in solar cells. As a result, the B2O3‐treated device delivers a champion efficiency of 9.37% without MgF2 anti‐reflection coating, which is currently the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells achieved by thermal evaporation method. This study provides a new method and mechanism for regulating optical and electrical properties of low‐dimensional inorganic thin films.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An efficient laser‐assisted regeneration process is developed to convert spent LiMn2O4 cathodes into performance‐enhanced, Ni‐doped cathodes. Surface Ni doping enhances interfacial processes and prevents capacity loss at lower temperatures by forming a new interface with a reduced charge transfer energy barrier. This innovative approach offers a sustainable solution for regenerating spent lithium‐ion battery cathodes.








Abstract
The rapid increase in lithium‐ion battery (LIB) production, fueled by the rise of electric vehicles, highlights significant challenges in managing end‐of‐life LIBs, particularly regarding environmental impact and waste management. Traditional recycling methods, such as pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, are energy‐intensive and consume substantial reagents. In this study, a laser‐assisted regeneration method is introduced for LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathodes, enabling in situ Ni doping into spent LMO cathodes (r‐LMO‐Ni) to enhance electrochemical performance. Surface Ni‐doping improves interfacial processes and reduces capacity loss at lower temperatures by creating a new interface with a lower charge transfer energy barrier. The r‐LMO‐Ni cathode surpasses pristine LMO cathodes, achieving a specific capacity of 112.95 mA h g−1 at 1 C and retaining 95.1% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0 °C.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Highly anisotropic 2D insulator CrOCl nanosheets are synthesized via space‐confined chemical vapor deposition growth. A MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single‐mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, which endows its device with polarization‐sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect. This study opens new prospects for exploring CrOCl‐based physics and electronics via symmetry engineering.









Abstract
Chromium oxychloride (CrOCl), a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator, has attracted significant interest in 2D optoelectronic, ferromagnetic, and quantum devices. However, the bottom–up preparation of 2D CrOCl remains challenging, limiting its property exploration and device application. Herein, the controllable synthesis of 2D CrOCl crystals by chemical vapor deposition is demonstrated. The combination reaction of precursors together with the space‐confined growth strategy, providing stable and stoichiometric growth conditions, enable a robust synthesis of high‐crystallinity CrOCl nanosheets with regular rhombus‐like morphology and uniform thickness. By tuning the growth temperature from 675 to 800 °C, the thickness of CrOCl nanosheets can be continuously modulated from 10.2 to 30.8 nm, with the domain size increasing from 16.9 to 25.5 µm. The as‐grown CrOCl nanosheets exhibit significant structural/optical anisotropy, ultrahigh insulativity, and superior air stability. Furthermore, a MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single‐mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, a novel interface phenomenon that converts MoS2 from isotropy to anisotropy. Consequently, the MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure device achieves polarization‐sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect, which are nonexistent in high‐symmetry 2D materials. This work paves the way for the future exploration of CrOCl‐based 2D physics and devices via symmetry engineering.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor integrates real‐time, dynamically reversible potassium ion (K⁺) fluorescence imaging (FI) with high‐resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This enables electroencephalogram‐concordant imaging of hidden epileptic foci and guides minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation on mice with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy, resulting in sustained seizure control and improved cognitive outcomes.









Abstract
Surgery remains an essential treatment for managing drug‐resistant focal epilepsy, but its accessibility and efficacy are limited in patients without distinct structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Potassium ion (K+), a critical marker for seizure‐associated neuronal signaling, shows significant promise for designing sensors targeting hidden epileptic foci. However, existing sensors cannot cross the blood‐brain barrier and lack the ability to specifically enrich and amplify K+ signals in the brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, an intravenously administered neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor (NSAN) is reported that combines real‐time dynamic reversible K+ fluorescence imaging with high‐resolution structural MRI, enabling electroencephalogram‐concordant imaging of MRI‐negative epileptic foci. Guided by NSANs, minimally invasive surgery is successfully performed in both intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) epilepsy model with foci confined to the ipsilateral hippocampus, and intraperitoneal KA model where foci are randomly distributed, resulting in sustained seizure control and cognitive improvement. These findings highlight the NSAN as a transformative tool for visualizing hidden epileptic foci, thereby broadening eligibility for minimally invasive and precision surgical intervention.

<title>Synergistic Multimodal Energy Dissipation Enhances Certified Efficiency of Flexible Organic Photovoltaics beyond 19%</title>

<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411989?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By combining multimodal energy dissipation and phase modulation in active layer films, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible electronics are innovatively co‐developed to achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.07%, which is the highest PCE reported for flexible organic photovoltaic device to date.








Abstract
All‐polymer organic solar cells (OSCs) have shown unparalleled application potential in the field of flexible wearable electronics in recent years due to the excellent mechanical and photovoltaic properties. However, the small molecule acceptors after polymerization in still retain some mechanical and aggregation properties of the small molecule, falling short of the ductility requirements for flexible devices. Here, based on the multimodal energy dissipation theory, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible devices are co‐enhanced by adding the thermoplastic elastomer material (polyurethane, PU) to the PM6:PBQx‐TF:PY‐IT‐based active layer films. The construction of multi‐fiber network structure and the decrease of films’ residual stresses contribute to the enhancement of carrier transport properties and the decrease of defect state density. Eventually, the PCE (power conversion efficiency) of 19.40% is achieved on the flexible devices with an effective area of 0.102 cm2, and the third‐party certified PCE reaches 19.07%, which is the highest PCE for flexible OSCs currently available. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large‐area module applications, the 25‐cm2‐based flexible and super‐flexible modules are prepared with the PCEs of 15.48% and 14.61%, respectively, and demonstration applications are implemented.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new BD2FCT material is developed as an advanced HTL tailored for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells through precise molecular engineering. This new polymer effectively reduces charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces, thereby leading to enhanced charge extraction. Incorporation of the IEICO‐4F into BD2FCT further improves charge funneling and absorption, resulting in a notable 10.1% PCE for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells.








Abstract
Silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) colloidal nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as ecofriendly photoactive materials with excellent photoconductivity and high absorption coefficients, in compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) guidelines. To maximize the theoretical potential of AgBiS2 CNC solar cells, a new diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)‐based polymer, BD2FCT, optimized as a hole transport layer (HTL), is developed. This asymmetric thiophene‐rich polymer HTL effectively complements the optical absorption spectrum of CNCs and forms a homogeneous layer atop the CNCs, facilitating favorable vertical charge transfer through intrinsic molecular packing. Furthermore, the BD2FCT HTL aligns energetically with AgBiS2, significantly reducing charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces and enhancing charge extraction and photocurrent generation across the entire optical absorption spectrum. These characteristics are further optimized through precise molecular engineering. Additionally, a low‐bandgap acceptor, IEICO‐4F, is structurally incorporated with the BD2FCT polymer to further improve charge funneling and complementary absorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals enhanced hole transfer from CNC to BD2FCT‐29DPP:IEICO‐4F, resulting in reduced charge recombination and efficient charge extraction. Consequently, a BD2FCT‐based AgBiS2 CNC solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1%, demonstrating significant improvements in short‐circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Arrays of microdomes with varying radii are formed by transforming micropillars made of the positive photoresist through a single‐step reflow process. These inverted microdomes exhibit radius‐dependent structural colors via total internal reflection and optical interference. By controlling the density and size of the microdomes, retroreflective multicolor graphics are achieved with exceptional color representation and resolution.








Abstract
Structural colors are known for their tunability, fade resistance, and eco‐friendliness. Recent advancements have shown that such colors can be efficiently produced using total internal reflection (TIR) on high‐refractive‐index convex microstructures without the need for periodic nanostructures. However, a reproducible, fast, and programmable production strategy for these microstructures is essential for commercial applications. Here, a single‐step method is reported for creating multicolor patterns by transforming photolithographically‐patterned micropillars into microdomes through thermal reflow. These micropillars, uniform in height but varying in diameter, are converted into microdomes that differ in diameter and height, which display a full spectrum of structural colors, creating a versatile color palette. This process enables the production of high‐resolution multicolor graphics using a rainbow color set, with high reproducibility. Additionally, by mixing distinct microdomes and adjusting their densities, a rich variety of color presentations can be achieved, enabling the recreation of arbitrary color images with microdome arrays. The variable heights of the microdomes also allow for dynamic discoloration or color changes through mechanical compression. The high reproducibility and scalability of this method hold significant commercial promise for various optical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A mechanical robust and healable actuator material with muscle‐like diastole and contraction abilities is fabricated by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol‐modified nano‐assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro‐nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction endow obtained artificial muscle with high output actuation and robust mechanical properties, exceeding typical natural muscles, which pave the way for advancements in next‐generation intelligent robotics.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles represent a role model in soft robotics featuring agile locomotion and incredible mechanical robustness. However, existing actuators lack an optimal combination of actuation parameters (including actuation modes, work capacity, mechanical strength, and damage repair) to rival biological tissues. Here, a biomimetic structural design strategy via multilevel relaxations (α/β/γ/δ‐relaxation) modulation is proposed for mechanical robust and healable actuator materials with muscle‐like diastole and contraction abilities by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol‐modified nano‐assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro‐nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction mimic the relative slippage of actin filaments and myosin in muscles, ensuring bistable actuation through rapid thermal α‐relaxation and expansion. Furthermore, kinetically active secondary β/γ/δ‐relaxation at reconfigurable interfaces can conquer the limited self‐healing ability of fixed‐orientation polymeric chains. The obtained artificial muscle exhibits high output actuation, robust mechanical properties (tensile strength of 33.5 MPa), and desired functional, mechanical self‐healing efficiency (89.7%), exceeding typical natural muscles in living systems. The bionic micro‐nano design strategy achieves bottom‐up cooperative relaxation modulation to integrate all‐round performance of natural muscles, which paves the way for substantial advancements in next‐generation intelligent robotics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Mild CF4 plasma is introduced to resolve the trade‐off between mobility and the on‐current (Ion)/off‐current (Ioff) ratio  in degenerate oxide semiconductors without the need for thermal annealing. This technique effectively reduces carrier density, achieving a high Ion/Ioff ratio (10⁸) while preserving high mobility (104 cm2 V−1s−1) of thick In2O3 transistors, leading to enhanced switching performance and making it ideal for three‐dimensional integration in advanced electronic devices.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are pivotal for next‐generation electronics due to their high electron mobility and excellent optical properties. However, In2O3, a key material in this family, encounters significant challenges in balancing high mobility and effective switching as its thickness is scaled down to nanometer dimensions. The high electron density in ultra‐thin In2O3 hinders its ability to turn off effectively, leading to a critical trade‐off between mobility and the on‐current (Ion)/off‐current (Ioff) ratio. This study introduces a mild CF4 plasma doping technique that effectively reduces electron density in 10 nm In2O3 at a low processing temperature of 70 °C, achieving a high mobility of 104 cm2 V⁻¹ s⁻¹ and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 10⁸. A subsequent low‐temperature post‐annealing further improves the critical reliability and stability of CF4‐doped In2O3 without raising the thermal budget, making this technique suitable for monolithic three‐dimensional (3D) integration. Additionally, its application is demonstrated in In2O3 depletion‐load inverters, highlighting its potential for advanced logic circuits and broader electronic and optoelectronic applications.

<title>Asymmetric Structural MXene/PBO Aerogels for High‐Performance Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ultra‐Low Reflection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By means of in situ growth method, heterostructure MXene@Ni electromagnetic functional fillers with good impedance matching performance are prepared by “electrostatic adsorption‐solvothermal reduction”. And the obtained asymmetric structural (MXene@Ni/PNF)‐(MXene/PNF) aerogels prepared by layer‐by‐layer freeze‐drying based on the layered modular design concept present high‐performance electromagnetic interference shielding with ultra‐low reflection and infrared camouflage.








Abstract
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with low electromagnetic (EM) waves reflection characteristics are ideal materials for blocking EM radiation and pollution. Materials with low reflectivity must be constructed using materials with excellent EM waves absorption properties. However, materials simultaneously possessing both low reflectivity and excellent EMI shielding performance remain scarce, consequently, multilayer structures need to be developed. Poly(p‐phenylene–2,6–benzobisoxazole) nanofibers (PNF) are prepared by deprotonation. PNF are combined with MXene and heterostructure MXene@Ni prepared by in‐situ growth; MXene@Ni/PNF acts as an EM absorption layer while MXene/PNF acts as an EM reflective layer. Finally, (MXene@Ni/PNF)–(MXene/PNF) aerogels are prepared by layer‐by‐layer freeze‐drying based on the layered modular design concept. Experimental characterizations revealed that (MXene@Ni/PNF)–(MXene/PNF) aerogels enable the efficient absorption‐reflection‐reabsorption of EM waves, effectively eliminating EMI. When the mass ratio of MXene to Ni in MXene@Ni is 1:6 and the mass fraction of MXene in the reflective layer is 80 wt.%, the (MXene@Ni/PNF)–(MXene/PNF) aerogels exhibit excellent EMI shielding performance (71 dB) and a very low reflection coefficient (R = 0.10). Finite element simulations verified that the developed asymmetric structural aerogels achieve high EMI shielding performance with low reflection characteristics. In addition, (MXene@Ni/PNF)–(MXene/PNF) aerogels display excellent infrared camouflage ability.

<title>Structure‐Induced Energetic Coordination Compounds as Additives for Laser Initiation Primary Explosives</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414886?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414886?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) are first used as additives to lead azide (LA) to design laser ignition primary explosives. These laser‐sensitive mixed composites exhibit remarkable initiating ability, extremely low laser initiation threshold (Emin), fast response times (Tmin), and acceptable stabilities. The strategy can broaden new application scenarios and unveil new perspectives for coordination compounds as additives in advanced laser pyrotechnics for aerospace applications.








Abstract
Laser ignition of primary explosives presents more reliable alternative to traditional electrical initiation methods. However, the commercial initiator lead azide (LA) requires a high‐power density laser to detonate, with the minimum laser initiation energy (Emin) of 2402 mJ. Currently, the laser‐ignitable metal complex‐based igniters still suffer from weak detonation capabilities and high Emin values. Here, the approach is first proposed to design laser ignition primary explosives within the high energy azide and tetrazole‐based energetic coordination compounds (ECCs), [Co(N3)(2‐bmttz)(H2O)]2 1 and [Co(N3)(2‐bmttz)(MeOH)]2 2 as additives to LA. Material 1e with 4 wt.% of 1 in LA, exhibits ultra‐low laser initiation threshold (Emin = 1.6 mJ) and ultrafast corresponding time (Tmin = 0.2 ms). Specially, compared to LA, the threshold of 1e is as low as 1/1500 of that of LA. Moreover, 30 mg 1e successfully detonates RDX with a laser energy of 1.6 mJ. Theoretical calculations and experiment results reveal that 1 exhibits the superior additive effect compared to 2, attributed to its more enhanced ability to generate free radicals and higher photothermal conversion efficiency under laser conditions. This work represents a paradigm shift, with the potential to develop a laser‐driven micro‐detonator combining powerful detonation capabilities with exceptionally low laser initiation energy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The built‐in electric fields (BIEFs) in the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors can be gradiently modulated via tailoring the sulfur vacancies, and exhibit parabola‐shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities. Moderate BIEF evidently facilitates the hydrogen desorption in the HER and the breakage of N─H bond in the UOR, endowing the Mo/MoSV1 electrolyzer with superior activity and durability.








Abstract
Constructing built‐in electric field (BIEF) in heterojunction catalyst is an effective way to optimize adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, while its precise tailor to achieve efficient bifunctional electrocatalysis remains great challenge. Herein, the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors with tunable BIEFs are elaborately prepared to simultaneously promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for sustainable hydrogen production. The BIEF induced by sulfur vacancies can be modulated from 0.79 to 0.57 to 0.42 mV nm−1, and exhibits a parabola‐shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities, the Mo/MoSV1 nanoreactor with moderate BIEF presents the best bifunctional activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the moderate BIEF can evidently facilitate the hydrogen adsorption/desorption in the HER and the breakage of N─H bond in the UOR. The electrolyzer assembled with Mo/MoSV1 delivers a cell voltage of 1.49 V at 100 mA cm−2, which is 437 mV lower than that of traditional water electrolysis, and also presents excellent durability at 200 mA cm−2 for 200 h. Life cycle assessment indicates the HER||UOR system possesses notable superiority across various environment impact and energy consumption. This work can provide theoretical and experimental direction on the rational design of advanced materials for energy‐saving and eco‐friendly hydrogen production.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c‐MOFs) are introduced as a novel class of multicolor electrochromic materials with significant potential for the next‐generation flexible electrochromic devices (FMEDs). This perspective provides new insights into the coloring mechanisms and presents strategies for optimizing device performance, highlighting potential multidisciplinary applications in camera lenses, camouflage, displays, and wearable electronics.








Abstract
There has been considerable interest in 2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c‐MOFs) for their potential applications in sensors, opto‐electronics, catalysis, and energy storage, owing to their ultra‐high specific surface area, relatively high electrical conductivity, and tunable pore channel sizes for ion/charge diffusion/adsorption. The unique advantages brought by systematic tunings in the metal nodes and organic ligands enable the creation of highly accessible and remarkable structures with diverse chemical and physical behaviors. While the 2D c‐MOFs are being explored for the rapid widening spectrum of applications, in this work, the great potential of multicolor transitions and functional properties of these 2D c‐MOFs are examined for the new generation of flexible multicolor electrochromic devices (FMEDs). Despite the rather limited and yet steady progress that has been made so far, 2D c‐MOFs offer great opportunities in addressing the monotonous color switching, undesirable stability, as well as the sluggish kinetics of electron/ion transportation, which are typically encountered by the conventional electrochromic materials. Together with the main challenges that are being faced, this perspective provides a timely re‐visit to the expected transition in the near future from the proof‐of‐concept demonstration to the eventual industrial‐scale implementation of 2D c‐MOFs in the new generation FEMDs.

This review comprehensively summaries the recent progresses on the interface engineering of 2D materials toward high‐temperature electronic devices, including FETs, optoelectronic devices, sensors, and neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
High‐temperature electronic materials and devices are highly sought after for advanced applications in aerospace, high‐speed automobiles, and deep‐well drilling, where active or passive cooling mechanisms are either insufficient or impractical. 2D materials (2DMs) represent promising alternatives to traditional silicon and wide‐bandgap semiconductors (WBG) for nanoscale electronic devices operating under high‐temperature conditions.

This review summarizes recent advancements in the interface engineering of 2DMs for high‐temperature electronic devices. Initially, the limitations of conventional silicon‐based materials and WBG semiconductors, alongside the advantages offered by 2DMs, are examined. Subsequently, strategies for interface engineering to enhance the stability of 2DMs and the performance of their devices are detailed. Furthermore, various interface‐engineered 2D high‐temperature devices, including transistors, optoelectronic devices, sensors, memristors, and neuromorphic devices, are reviewed. Finally, a forward‐looking perspective on future 2D high‐temperature electronics is presented. This review offers valuable insights into emerging 2DMs and their applications in high‐temperature environments from both fundamental and practical perspectives.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To investigate the effects of topological characteristics of polymers on their lymph node (LN) targeting activity and how their molecular weight (MW) influences pharmacokinetics to support LN homing, a series of polymer‐TLR agonist conjugates (PTACs) are designed. Among the conjugates, the dendritic 6‐arm PTAC with an MW of 60 kDa demonstrated the highest LN drainage, deepest penetration, and prolonged retention. As a result, it induced broad antibody and T cell responses, enhancing vaccine immunogenicity and suppressing tumor growth.









Abstract
Strategically targeting lymph nodes (LNs) to orchestrate the initiation and regulation of adaptive immune responses is one of the most pressing challenges in the context of vaccination. Herein, a series of polymer‐TLR agonist conjugates (PTACs) is developed to investigate the impact of dendritic‐topological characteristics on their LN targeting activity in vivo, and their molecular weight (MW) on their pharmacokinetics in support of their LN homing. Notably, the dendritic 6‐arm PTAC with a MW of 60 kDa (6A‐PTAC‐60k) rapidly delivered cargo to draining LNs after administration to peripheral tissues. Specifically, this topologic structure ameliorated the targeting behavior within lymphatic vessels and LNs, including an elevated amount of TLR7/8 agonist delivered to the LNs, an improved distribution pattern among barrier cells and immune cells, increased permeability, and prolonged retention. Furthermore, the 6A‐PTAC‐60k formulation induced broad antibody and T cell responses, enhancing vaccine immunogenicity and suppressing tumor growth. The results revealed that both the topology and MW of polymers are crucial factors for immunoadjuvant distribution and their functional activity in the draining LNs, which, in turn, enhanced the immunogenicity of the vaccine formulation. This study may provide a chemical and structural basis for optimizing the design of immunoadjuvant delivery systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diluted heterojunctions are employed to increase the structure order in the layer‐by‐layer fabricated solar cells and polymeric diluent is found superior that the small molecular diluent, creating OSC having dual fibrils with significantly increased absorption and reduced charge recombination to realize an efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%).








Abstract
As an exitonic photovoltaic device, organic solar cells (OSCs) consist of electron donating and accepting components in their photoactive layer, in which the molecular interactions between donor and acceptor can significantly affect the nanoscale morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. In this work, by diluting electron donor with electron acceptor having opposite electrostatic potentials to promote the structural order via strengthened intermolecular interactions, this study shows that polymeric diluent is more effective due to its long‐ranged conjugated backbone compared with small molecular diluent. The ternary heterojunction made of C5‐16:L8‐BO binary acceptors diluted with D18 shows the strongest structural order, benefiting from the strong interactions between L8‐BO and C5‐16. The enhanced structural order within the photoactive layer prepared by layer‐by‐layer deposition of the diluted p‐type and n‐type heterojunctions contributes to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transport, and inhibited charge recombination. As the result, OSC based on D18 (PY‐IT diluted)/L8‐BO:C5‐16 (D18 diluted) having donor and acceptor dual fibrils obtains an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%), which is one of the highest certified PCE up to date.

This study explores ultrathin epitaxial La2Ti2O7 films, a layered perovskite from the Carpy‐Galy family, grown on various substrates. Remarkably, high epitaxial strain promotes layer‐by‐layer growth and stabilizes the correct phase. The films exhibit a polarization significantly higher than previously reported, exceeding 18 µCcm−2, and retain ferroelectricity down to a single‐unit‐cell thickness, highlighting their potential for advanced nanoscale devices.








Abstract
Layered perovskite‐based compounds offer a range of unconventional properties enabled by their naturally anisotropic structure. Among these, the Carpy‐Galy phases (AnBnO3n+2), characterized by (110)‐oriented perovskite planes interleaved with additional oxygen layers, stand out for robust in‐plane polarization. However, the challenges associated with the synthesis of ultrathin Carpy‐Galy films and understanding the impact of strain on their properties limit their integration into devices. Here, La2Ti2O7 (n = 4) films grown on substrates imposing tensile, compressive, or negligible epitaxial strains are investigated. Surprisingly, a 3% tensile strain from DyScO3 (100) substrates facilitates layer‐by‐layer growth mode, whereas compressive (LaAlO3‐Sr2TaAlO6 (110)) or negligible (SrTiO3 (110)) epitaxial strains require post‐deposition annealing to reach comparable crystallinity. Using density‐functional theory calculations, scanning probe microscopy, X‐ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and polarization switching experiments, it is confirmed that these films possess exceptional ferroelectric properties, including a polarization of 18 µCcm−2 – more than three times higher than previously reported – as well as persistence of ferroelectricity down to a single‐unit‐cell thickness. This study not only advances the understanding of Carpy‐Galy phases as epitaxial thin films but also lays a foundation for their integration into advanced ferroelectric device architectures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study provides a Si‐CMOS compatible approach to synthesize 2D wafer‐scale 1T‐CrTe2 films. Magnetic property measurements reveal that the synthesized 1T‐CrTe2 films exhibit room‐temperature magnetism, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and distinct step‐like magnetic transitions. Moreover, the study highlights how unintentional adsorbents or dopants can significantly influence the magnetic behaviors of such 1T‐CrTe2 films.








Abstract
2D room‐temperature ferromagnet CrTe2 is a promising candidate material for spintronic applications. However, its large‐scale and cost‐effective synthesis remains a challenge. Here, the fine controllable synthesis of wafer‐scale 1T‐CrTe2 films is reported on a SiO2/Si substrate using plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition at temperatures below 400 °C. Magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal that the synthesized 1T‐CrTe2 films exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy along with distinct step‐like magnetic transitions. It is found that 1T‐CrTe2 is susceptible to oxygen adsorption even in ambient conditions. The theoretical calculations indicate that the oxidation of surface layers is crucial for the absence of out‐of‐plane easy axis in few‐layer CrTe2, while the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling among the upper surface layers leads to the observed step‐like magnetic transitions. The study provides a Si‐CMOS compatible approach for the fabrication of magnetic 2D materials and highlights how unintentional adsorbents or dopants can significantly influence the magnetic behaviors of these materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultrathin‐conjugated MOFs nanosheets with single‐crystalline characteristics are prepared by surfactant‐assisted solution synthesis strategy. The π–π stacked MOF/graphene van der Waals heterostructure can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode‐locking with femtosecond pulse duration and high‐order harmonic mode‐locking with GHz repetition frequency. This preferable stacking exhibits superior π‐conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their outstanding characteristics. However, due to the strong interlayer π–π stacking interactions, the preparation of high‐quality and atomic‐scale single‐crystalline conjugated MOF structures continues to pose a significant challenge. The investigation of its nonlinear optical (NLO) property and application for ultrafast photonics is still rare. Herein, the ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 and Ni3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11‐hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single‐crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant‐assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the π–π stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG‐VHS and NiNsG‐VHS) are achieved by ultrasound‐assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior π‐conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third‐order NLO polarizability of CuNsG‐VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near‐infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG‐VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode‐locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high‐order harmonic mode‐locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An autonomous, moisture‐driven flexible electrogenerative dressing (AMFED) is developed by integrating a moist‐electric generator, an antibacterial hydrogel dressing, and concentric molybdenum electrodes. This self‐sustaining dressing provides continuous electrical stimulation and exhibits potent antibacterial activity. In vivo studies demonstrate that AMFED effectively accelerates diabetic wound healing.








Abstract
Electrotherapy has shown considerable potential in treating chronic wounds, but conventional approaches relying on bulky external power supplies and mechanical force are limited in their clinical utility. This study introduces an autonomous, moisture‐driven flexible electrogenerative dressing (AMFED) that overcomes these limitations. The AMFED integrates a moist‐electric generator (MEG), an antibacterial hydrogel dressing, and concentric molybdenum (Mo) electrodes to provide a self‐sustaining electrical supply and potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The MEG harnesses chemical energy from moisture to produce a stable direct current of 0.61 V without external input, delivering this therapeutic electrical stimulation to the wound site through the Mo electrodes. The AMFED facilitates macrophage polarization toward reparative M2 phenotype and regulates inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, in vivo studies suggest that the AMFED group significantly enhances chronic wound healing, with an approximate 41% acceleration compared to the control group. Using a diabetic mouse wound model, the AMFED demonstrates its effectiveness in promoting nerve regulation, epithelial migration, and vasculogenesis. These findings present a novel and efficient platform for accelerating chronic wound healing.

A series of 1D stable magnetic inorganic electrides are identified by high throughput screening and experimental synthesis. Furthermore, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit various applications, including spintronics, topological electronics, low work function, electron emission, and high‐performance catalysts for NH3 reductions.








Abstract
Inorganic electrides, which are characterized by the presence of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) within distinct geometric cavities, exhibit unique properties and have garnered significant attention in various fields. Nevertheless, inorganic electrides face significant challenges in terms of their stability and magnetic topological states. To address these issues, a combination of high‐throughput screening, first‐principles calculations, and experimental synthesis is used to identify a series of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides with diverse properties and applications. Specifically, 17 ferromagnetic (FM) and 19 antiferromagnetic (AFM) 1D inorganic electrides, with different topological bulk and surface states are reported. Moreover, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit lower work functions (≈3 eV) on the (001) surface, significantly enhancing their applications in ammonia synthesis. Further experimental synthesis and characterization suggested that 1D inorganic electrides exhibit extremely high stability owing to the strong hybridization between IAEs and atoms and the small surface area of IAEs. These findings involve the screening, investigation, preparation, and application of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides, heralding a new era in the study of 1D inorganic electrides in topological quantum science, spintronics, energy, and the corresponding interdisciplinary areas.

<title>Two Material Properties from One Wavelength‐Orthogonal Photoresin Enabled by a Monochromatic Laser Integrated Stereolithographic Apparatus (Mono LISA)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A single object with dual properties – degradable and non‐degradable – is fabricated in a single print simply by switching the printing colors. The advanced multi‐material printing is enabled by the combination of a fully wavelength‐orthogonal photoresin and a monochromatic tunable laser printer, paving the way for precise multi‐material differentiation within a single print.









Abstract
Multi‐material printing has experienced critical advances in recent years, yet material property differentiation capabilities remain limited both with regard to the accessible properties – typically hard versus soft – and the achievable magnitude of differentiation. To enhance multi‐material printing capabilities, precise photochemical control during 3D printing is essential. Wavelength‐differentiation is a particularly intriguing concept yet challenging to implement. Notably, dual‐wavelength printing to fabricate hard and soft sections within one object has emerged, where one curing process is insensitive to visible light, while UV irradiation inevitably activates the entire resin, limiting true spatio‐temporal control of the material properties. Until now, pathway‐independent wavelength‐orthogonal printing has not been realized, where each wavelength exclusively triggers only one of two possible reactions, independent of the order in which the wavelengths are applied. Herein, a multi‐wavelength printing technique is introduced employing a tunable laser to monochromatically deliver light to the printing platform loaded with a fully wavelength‐orthogonal resin. Guided by photochemical action plots, two distinct wavelengths – each highly selective toward a specific photocycloaddtion reaction – are utilized to generate distinct networks within the photoresin. Ultimately, together with the printing technique, this orthogonally addressable photoresin allows fabricating multi‐material objects with degradable and non‐degradable properties, in a single fabrication step.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By controlling the injection and transport of charge carriers through a novel quantum‐dot‐electrolyte emitting layer, quantum‐dot‐electrolyte light‐emitting diodes (QE‐LEDs) have been developed, exhibiting a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 20.0% and a lifetime (T95) of 3.74  ×  105 h at 100 cd m−2. Besides, the first active‐matrix QE‐LED display with stable emissions (>17.6 years at T95@100 cd m−2) has been fabricated.








Abstract
Electroluminescence (EL) is essential for modern technologies, such as displays, lighting, and optical communications. To date, some kinds of artificial EL devices have been developed, including organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs), quantum‐dot (QD) LEDs, and light‐emitting electrochemical cells. However, issues (e.g., inefficient charge injection, exciton quenching) limit the further EL performance. Here, another promising kind of EL device is reported, which is called QD‐electrolyte LED (QE‐LED). The key feature of QE‐LED is that an ionic liquid is doped into QDs as the electrolyte emitter of multi‐layer device architectures. Both theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that an enhanced interface electric field from the in situ formed electrical double layer is leveraged to improve the charge injection and transport. With the introduction of insulating polymers into QD‐electrolyte emitters, red QE‐LED achieves an external quantum efficiency of 20.5% and a lifetime (T95) over 3.74 × 105 h at the display‐related luminance of 100 cd m−2, indicating that the QE‐LED is among the best EL devices. Furthermore, an active‐matrix QE‐LED display is demonstrated with superior stability that overtakes the commercial benchmark. These results offer an avenue to discover unexplored EL devices and provide potential pathways to enhance charge dynamics for EL devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) with unprecedented long life and ultrahigh specific capacity are demonstrated through the design of an acceptor‐multi‐F state electrolyte. This electrolyte design endows FIBs with durable reversible fluorination/defluorination reaction (over 3700 cycles), a high‐output voltage of CuF2//Li configuration (with a discharge plateau of 2.9 V), and larger‐sized pouch‐type CuF2//Sn+SnF2 configuration (with a reversible capacity of 530 mAh g−1).








Abstract
Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) have garnered significant attention due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, dendrite‐free safety, and resource abundance. Although some anion acceptors have been proposed to address the insolubility of inorganic fluoride salts, the difficulty in dissociating fluoride ions from acceptors results in short lifespan and extremely low specific capacity of FIBs. Here, a fluoride ion battery is demonstrated with unprecedented long life and ultrahigh specific capacity through the design of an acceptor‐multi‐F state electrolyte. The high Lewis acidity of triphenylantimony chloride (TSbCl) as a novel anion acceptor in electrolyte facilitates the complete dissociation of CsF, and the resulting TSbCl‐F complex can further interact with fluoride ions to form the acceptor‐multi‐F states. This strategy combines the high dissociation capability for fluoride salts with the minimal thermodynamic barriers for releasing fluoride ions at electrode‐electrolyte interface. This electrolyte design endows FIBs with durable reversible fluorination/defluorination reaction (3700 cycles with high coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and small voltage polarization of 30 mV) and ultrahigh reversible capacity (580 mAh g−1 after 40 cycles at 100 mA g−1). The high‐output voltage FIBs of CuF2//Li configuration (with discharge plateau of 2.9 V) and larger‐sized pouch‐type FIBs of CuF2//Sn+SnF2 configuration (with reversible capacity of 530 mAh g−1) are demonstrated.

<title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Boosted by Surface Hydroxyls‐Modulated Hydrogen Migration over Nonreducible Oxides</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hydrogen spillover is considered to play a major role in ubiquitous technologies involving hydrogen. However, its application in Earth‐abundant widely‐used non‐reducible oxides is severely limited by much shorter migration distances of atomic hydrogen compared to those in reducible oxides. This study presents a surface hydroxyl modulation strategy to enhance hydrogen migration over nonreducible oxides, promoting electrocatalytic hydrogenation for water purification.








Abstract
The migration of atomic hydrogen species over heterogeneous catalysts is deemed essential for hydrogenation reactions, a process closely related to the catalyst's functionalities. While surface hydroxyls‐assisted hydrogen spillover is well documented on reducible oxide supports, its effect on widely‐used nonreducible supports, especially in electrocatalytic reactions with water as the hydrogen source, remains a subject of debate. Herein, a nonreducible oxide‐anchored copper single‐atom catalyst (Cu1/SiO2) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO2 can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu1/SiO2 catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu1/SiO2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen‐species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.

<title>Mitochondrial Transplantation via Magnetically Responsive Artificial Cells Promotes Intracerebral Hemorrhage Recovery by Supporting Microglia Immunological Homeostasis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A type of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) has been developed, demonstrating the loading of mitochondria and self‐enclosure processes to ensure the protection of mitochondrial transport via the bloodstream. The treatment with ACs effectively transplanted mitochondria around the lesion, thereby improving neurological recovery by supporting microglia immunological homeostasis after intracerebral hemorrhage.








Abstract
The immune‐inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro‐inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain. Here, a novel strategy for mitochondrial transplantation via intravenous injection of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) are proposed. ACs can protect the loaded mitochondria and selectively accumulate around the lesion under an external magnetic field (EMF). In this study, mitochondria released from ACs can effectively improve microglial mitochondrial function, attenuate their pro‐inflammatory attributes, and elevate the proportion of immunosuppressive microglia. In this way, microglia immune homeostasis in the brain is reestablished, and inflammation is attenuated, ultimately promoting functional recovery. This study presents an effective approach to transplant mitochondria into the brain, offering a promising alternative to modulate the immune‐inflammatory cascade in the brain following ICH.

The functionalized acellular mushroom scaffold promotes the healing of infectious bone defects through 1) controlling bacterial infections through Zn2+/curcumin MOFs; 2) rapid cell recruitment induced by its naturally aligned channels; 3) immune regulation and osteogenic differentiation by icariin.








Abstract
Infected bone defects are a common clinical condition, but conventional treatments often fail to achieve the desired outcomes, including addressing antibiotic resistance and preventing nonunion complications. In the presented study, a functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold is developed composed of its naturally aligned channels, Zn2+/curcumin MOFs, hydroxyapatite minerals, and icariin. In vitro, It is found that functionalized acellular mushroom stem scaffold can control bacterial infections through Zn2+/curcumin MOFs. The naturally aligned channels guide bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) migration, and the components adsorbed on the acellular substrate further promote the migration of BMSCs. Moreover, these functional components further accelerated the polarization of M2 macrophage and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In vivo, the functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold cleared infected bacteria within 3 days, induced extracellular matrix secretion and alignment, and promoted new bone formation to cover defects within 8 weeks. The functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold provides a promising strategy for treating infectious bone defects.

<title>Double Confinement Design to Access Highly Stable Intermetallic Nanoparticles for Fuel Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work depicts a double confinement design to greatly improve the stability of intermetallic nanoparticles while maintaining their high catalytic activity toward proton exchange membrane fuel cells. This synthesis strategy involves the carbon encapsulation and O2‐assisted pyrolysis process to fabricate carbon‐supported Pt‐based intermetallic nanoparticles with carbon and Pt‐skin confinement.








Abstract
Maintaining the stability of low Pt catalysts during prolonged operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) remains a substantial challenge. Here, a double confinement design is presented to significantly improve the stability of intermetallic nanoparticles while maintaining their high catalytic activity toward PEMFCs. First, a carbon shell is coated on the surface of nanoparticles to form carbon confinement. Second, O2 is introduced during the annealing process to selectively etch the carbon shell to expose the active surface, and to induce the segregation of surface transition metals to form Pt‐skin confinement. Overall, the intermetallic nanoparticles are protected by carbon confinement and Pt‐skin confinement to withstand the harsh environment of PEMFCs. Typically, the double confined Pt1Co1 catalyst exhibits an exceptional mass activity of 1.45 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V in PEMFCs tests, with only a 17.3% decay after 30 000 cycles and no observed structure changes, outperforming most reported PtCo catalysts and DOE 2025 targets. Furthermore, the carbon confinement proportion can be controlled by varying the thickness of the coated carbon shell, and this strategy is also applicable to the synthesis of double‐confined Pt1Fe1 and Pt1Cu1 intermetallic nanoparticles.

<title>Electrochemically Driven Optical Dynamics of Reflectin Protein Films</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The use of electrochemical correlative ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to trigger, control, and observe changes in the optical properties of reflectin protein films is demonstrated. Voltage‐regulated charge neutralization allows tunable, reversible, and cyclic control of the water volume fraction in the reflectin film, thereby influencing its optical characteristics.








Abstract
Neuronally triggered phosphorylation drives the dynamic condensation of reflectin proteins, enabling squid to fine tune the colors reflected from specialized skin cells (iridocytes) for camouflage and communication. Reflectin, the primary component of iridocyte lamellae, forms alternating layers of protein and low refractive index extracellular space within membrane‐encapsulated structures, acting as a biologically tunable distributed Bragg reflector. In vivo, reflectin condensation induces osmotic dehydration of these lamellae, reducing their thickness and shifting the wavelength of reflected light. Inspired by this natural mechanism, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of imidazolium moieties within the protein provides a reversible and tunable method to control the water volume fraction in reflectin thin films, allowing precise, dynamic modulation of the film’s refractive index and thickness — mimicking the squid’s dynamic color adaptation. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we developed electrochemical correlative ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, enabling real‐time analysis of optical property changes of reflectin films. This electrochemically driven approach offers unprecedented control over reflectin condensation dynamics. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of biophysical processes governing cephalopod coloration but also pave the way for bio‐inspired materials and devices that seamlessly integrate biological principles with synthetic systems to bridge the biotic‐abiotic gap.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Single crystal microcavity organic light‐emitting diodes (SC‐MC‐OLEDs) with high color purity (FWHM < 10 nm), high brightness (> 106 cd m−2), high efficiency (EQE∼4%), high polarization (> 0.90) and high stability are realized by combining the large size 2D organic single crystals with efficient microcavity effect, unlocking potential for ultra‐high‐definition displays and AR/VR applications.








Abstract
The development of ultra‐high‐definition (UHD) displays demands organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity of all three primary colors for a wide color gamut and high brightness essential for future AR/VR applications. However, the vibronic coupling in organic emitters typically results in broad emissions, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) exceeding 40–50 nm. Herein, multicolor organic single‐crystal microcavity light‐emitting diodes (SC‐MC‐OLEDs) are demonstrated by embedding ultrathin 2D organic single crystals (2D‐OSCs) between two silver layers that serve as both electrodes and mirrors. By leveraging the microcavity effect, the resonant output frequencies of SC‐MC‐OLEDs can be continuously tuned from 448 to 602 nm by adjusting the thickness of 2D‐OSCs (i.e., the microcavity length), achieving high color purity with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of <10 nm. Furthermore, the Purcell effect in SC‐MC‐OLEDs enhances the radiative rate and improves light‐coupling efficiency, resulting in a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 4% and minimal efficiency roll‐off. Due to the excellent bipolar transport properties of OSCs, the brightness of SC‐MC‐OLEDs surpasses 106 cd m−2, along with a degree of linear polarization exceeding 0.9, unlocking new application opportunities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Full‐color carbon dots (FCDs) with emission wavelengths ranging from 434 to 703 nm are synthesized using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the sole precursor. The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and gain performance of the FCDs are enhanced due to cross‐linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Tunable liquid‐state laser emissions in green, yellow, red, and NIR regions are achieved with lower laser thresholds compared to RhB, demonstrating superior laser stability. Additionally, these FCDs are validated as excellent laser sources. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirmed that FCDs exhibit significantly lower toxicity and superior staining effects compared to RhB.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) serve as a novel, non‐toxic, cost‐effective, and highly‐stable solution‐processable nanolaser material. However, compared to commonly used commercial laser dyes, CDs exhibit lower photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), radiation transition rates, and gain coefficients. Consequently, this leads to higher laser thresholds that significantly impede the expansion of practical applications for CDs. Therefore, enhancing the gain performance of CDs is crucial in guiding the design of CD gain materials and promoting their practical applications. Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full‐color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B‐CDs, G‐CDs, Y‐CDs, R‐CDs, and NIR‐CDs) fluorescence through cross‐linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703 nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross‐linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load‐carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric‐expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load‐carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low‐expansion polyimide (4.52 ppm K−1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load‐carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19 Hz, a response speed of 60.96 ± 3.08°/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 ± 2.52°. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load‐carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20 800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this report, the internal strain affecting the stability of FAPbI3 perovskite is addressed through the design of additives in the precursor solution. Instead of conventional methylammonium chloride, a triple‐additive approach is employed, leading to improved phase stability and reduced strain gradient. The strategy results in enhanced durability and efficiency, with power conversion efficiency retention of 95% after 8000 h under the ISOS‐D‐1 condition and a maximum PCE of 24.50%.








Abstract
The stability of the FAPbI3 perovskite phase is significantly affected by internal strain. In this report, additives in the perovskite precursor solution are designed to prevent local lattice mismatch of the resulting perovskite layer. Instead of using a conventional methylammonium chloride (Control), triple additives (Target) are introduced by considering ion association and formation energy. The out‐of‐plane orientation for the (100) plane is less pronounced by the triple additives compared to the Control film with a highly enhanced preferred orientation, which reduces the strain gradient and the Pb─I bond distance. Moreover, the anisotropic atomic‐level lattice strain along (111) plane, associated with the α‐to‐δ phase transition, is more uniformly distributed by the triple additives. The triple‐additive strategy demonstrates exceptional phase stability under relative humidity as high as 90% and the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS)‐L‐2 protocol. The device lifetime measured under the ISOS‐D‐1 condition shows that the Target perovskite solar cell (PSC) maintains 95% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for over 8000 h, and the best PCE of 24.50% is achieved.

<title>Glassy Thermal Transport Triggers Ultra‐High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe</title>

Inhomogeneous ferroelectric instability induced confined phonon mean free path leading to glass‐like thermal transport, and ultra‐high thermoelectric performance in BiSe, Pb co‐doped GeTe.








Abstract
The consequences of broken long‐range atomic arrangement in glasses or amorphous solids are reflected in the temperature dependence of lattice thermal conductivity (κlat). However, the appearance of glassy ultralow κlat in a crystalline solid with high electrical transport like metal is unusual but can have a remarkable impact on the thermoelectric performance of a material. Here, an ultra‐high thermoelectric performance is demonstrated with a maximum figure of merit, zT ≈ 2.7 (≈2.92 with Dulong–Petit heat capacity) via achieving glassy thermal transport along with significant electrical conductivity in ball milled BiSe, Pb co‐doped polycrystalline Ge1.03Te followed by spark plasma sintering. The glassy thermal transport results from the inhomogeneous ferroelectric instability developed due to local polar distortions near the dopant sites, which interacts with soft polar optical modes via strain fluctuations. Resulting structural degeneracy and associated soft vibrations sink heat effectively from acoustic phonons, which along with various nanoscale defects, confine the phonon mean free path (MFP) close to the interatomic distance, rendering the thermal transport glassy. However, the material still maintains a high electrical conductivity at ambient condition due to much longer MFP of the charge carriers. A promising output power density of ≈0.8 W cm−2 for ΔT ≈441 K in double‐leg thermoelectric device demonstrate the potential of this material for mid‐temperature thermoelectric applications.

<title>Waveguide Microactuators Self‐Rolled Around an Optical Fiber Taper</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel self‐rolling integration strategy mounts ultrathin (≈2 µm) poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide)/Au microactuators onto optical fiber tapers, achieving unprecedented bending angles (>800°) and rapid response (≈0.55 s). This waveguide microactuator enables dynamic capture of fast‐moving microorganisms and provides a high‐performance, versatile platform for biomedical applications in confined, unstructured environments.








Abstract
Precisely capturing and manipulating microscale objects, such as individual cells and microorganisms, is fundamental to advancements in biomedical research and microrobotics. Photoactuators based on optical fibers serving as flexible, unobstructed waveguides are well‐suited for these operations, particularly in confined locations where free‐space illumination is impractical. However, integrating optical fibers with microscale actuators poses significant challenges due to size mismatch, resulting in slow responses inadequate for handling motile micro‐objects. This study designs microactuators based on hydrogel/Au bilayer heterostructures that self‐roll around a tapered optical fiber. This self‐rolling mechanism enables the use of thin hydrogel layers only a few micrometers thick, which rapidly absorb and release water molecules during a phase transition. The resulting microactuators exhibit low bending stiffness and extremely fast responses, achieving large bending angles exceeding 800° within 0.55 s. Using this technique, this study successfully captures rapidly swimming Chlamydomonas and Paramecium, and demonstrates programmable non‐reciprocal motion for effective non‐contact manipulation of yeast cells. This approach provides a versatile platform for microscale manipulations and holds promise for advanced biomedical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dead APC‐4T1‐N3‐LipoH (DPNL) is constructed via clicking reprogrammed APC like‐4T1 cells with liposome encapsulating HMME (LHs). Sonosensitive DPNL cells effectively target tumor sites and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Upon ultrasound, DPNL cells could co‐stimulate the antigen‐presenting program and strikingly elicit antigen‐specific T cell‐mediated adaptive immunity in TDLNs as well as MHC‐I unrestricted NK cell‐mediated innate immunity within tumors for comprehensive sonoimmunotherapy for triple negative breast cancers.








Abstract
Ultrasound therapy has turned up as a noninvasive multifunctional tool for cancer immunotherapy. However, the insufficient co‐stimulating molecules and loss of peptide‐major histocompatibility complex I (MHC‐I) expression on tumor cells lead to poor therapy of sonoimmunotherapies. Herein, this work develops a sonosensitive system to augment MHC‐I unrestricted natural killer (NK) cell‐mediated innate immunity and T cell‐mediated adaptive immunity by leveraging antigen presentation cell (APC)‐like tumor cells. Genetically engineered tumor cells featuring sufficient co‐stimulating molecules are cryo‐shocked and conjugated with a sonosensitizer, hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether, using click chemistry. These cells (DPNLs) exhibit characteristics of tumor and draining lymph node homing. Under ultrasound, NK cell‐mediated innate immunity within the tumor microenvironment could be activated, and T cells in the tumor‐draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are stimulated through co‐stimulatory molecules. In combination with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) antibody, DPNLs extend the survival time and inhibited lung metastasis in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. This study provides an alternative approach for sonoimmunotherapy with precise sonosensitizer delivery and enhanced NK cell and T cell activation.

<title>DNA‐Capturing Manganese‐Coordinated Chitosan Microparticles Potentiate Radiotherapy via Activating the cGAS‐STING Pathway and Maintaining Tumor‐Infiltrating CD8+ T‐Cell Stemness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
DNA‐capturing CS‐Mn microparticles are prepared to potentiate radioimmunotherapy. Upon injection into the tumors after X‐ray irradiation, they undergo rapid dissociation to release chitosan which assembles with the extracellular DNA fragments released from the dead cancer cells to in situ form CS‐DNA complexes and synergize with Mn2+ to stimulate DC maturation via activating the cGAS‐STING pathway for enhanced CD8+ T‐cell stemness.








Abstract
The radiotherapy‐induced release of DNA fragments can stimulate the cyclic guanosine monophosphate‐adenosine monophosphate synthase‐stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS‐STING) pathway to prime antitumor immunity, but this pathway is expected to be less potent because of the inefficient cytosolic delivery of negatively charged DNA fragments. In this study, manganese‐coordinated chitosan (CS‐Mn) microparticles with selective DNA‐capturing capacity are concisely prepared via a coordination‐directed one‐pot synthesis process to potentiate the immunogenicity of radiotherapy. The obtained CS‐Mn microparticles that undergo rapid disassembly under physiological conditions can selectively bind with DNA to form positively charged DNA‐CS assemblies because of the strong electrostatic interaction between linear chitosan and DNA molecules. They thus enable efficient cytosolic delivery of DNA in the presence of serum to cooperate with Mn2+ to activate the cGAS‐STING pathway in dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral injection, the CS‐Mn microparticles markedly enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy against both irradiated and distal tumors in different tumor models via collectively promoting tumor‐infiltrating CD8+ T‐cell stemness and the activation of innate immunity. The radiosensitization effect of CS‐Mn microparticles can be further augmented by concurrently applying anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 (anti‐PD‐1) immunotherapy. This work highlights an ingenious strategy to prepare Trojan horse‐like DNA‐capturing microparticles as cGAS‐STING‐activating radiosensitizers for effective radioimmunotherapy.

A novel Ga2O3 solar‐blind photodetector with a vertically stratified crystalline structure and VO concentration is designed to spatially separate the carrier's generation and transport channels in the device, thus achieving excellent responsivity and response speed simultaneously.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) emerges as a promising solar‐blind photodetector (SBPD) material if the “Response Speed (RS) dilemma” can be resolved. Devices with spatially segregated carrier generation and transport channels offer a potential solution but remain less available. This work introduces a novel thermal pulse treatment (TPT) method to achieve a vertically stratified crystalline structure and oxygen vacancies (VO) throughout the Ga2O3 film, validated through extensive characterizations. Technology Computer‐Aided Design (TCAD) simulations corroborated the critical role of VO stratification in enhancing the responsivity (Rλ) and response speed simultaneously. Consequently, the TPT‐processed SBPD exhibited exceptional performance, boasting a maximum  Rλ of 312.6 A W−1 and a faster decay time of 40 µs, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding SBPD chips show significant potential for applications in solar‐blind imaging, light trajectory tracking, and solar‐blind power meters. This work thus provides a viable strategy to address the “RS dilemma” common in most wide‐bandgap materials, showcasing excellent application value.

<title>Perturbing Organelle‐Level K+/Ca2+ Homeostasis by Nanotherapeutics for Enhancing Ion‐Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ion‐mediated immunotherapy agent (IMIA) is engineered to achieve precise spatiotemporal control of perturbing K+/Ca2+ homeostasis at the organelle‐level, which can effectively evoke tumor‐associated immunogenicity, thereby stimulating the activation of DCs and potentiating the infiltration of tumor‐specific cytotoxic T cells to achieve high‐performance cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Intracellular ions are involved in numerous pivotal immune processes, but the precise regulation of these signaling ions to achieve innovative immune therapeutic strategies is still a huge challenge. Here, an ion‐mediated immunotherapy agent (IMIA) is engineered to achieve precise spatiotemporal control of perturbing K+/Ca2+ homeostasis at the organelle‐level, thereby amplifying antitumor immune responses to achieve high‐performance cancer therapy. By taking in intracellular K+ and supplying exogenous Ca2+ within tumor cells, K+/Ca2+ homeostasis is perturbed by IMIA. In parallel, perturbing K+ homeostasis induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers the release of Ca2+ from ER and causes a decreased concentration of Ca2+ in ER, which further accelerates ER‐mitochondria Ca2+ flux and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (store‐operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE)) via opening Ca2+ release‐activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, thus creating a self‐amplifying ion interference loop to perturb K+/Ca2+ homeostasis. In this process, the elevated immunogenicity of tumor cells would evoke robust antitumor immune responses by driving the excretion of damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Importantly, this ion‐immunotherapy strategy reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and awakens the systemic immune response and long‐term immune memory effect, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of primary/distant tumors, orthotopic tumors as well as metastatic tumors in different mice models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The practical application of aqueous Zn‐I2 batteries is seriously restricted by their low energy density and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a temperature‐insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax‐bacterial cellulose / p(AM‐co‐VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) is designed to realize an energy‐dense Zn‐I2 battery with cascade I0/I−, I+/I0, and Br0/Br− redox couples over a widen temperature range from −50 to 50 °C.








Abstract
The practical development of aqueous zinc‐iodine (Zn‐I2) batteries is greatly hindered by the low energy density resulting from conventional I0/I− conversion and the limited temperature tolerance. Here, a temperature‐insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax‐bacterial cellulose / p(AM‐co‐VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) for achieving an energy‐dense cascade aqueous Zn‐I2 battery over a wide temperature range from −50 to 50 °C is designed. A comprehensive investigation, combining advanced spectroscopic investigation and DFT calculations, has revealed that the presence of Br species in the gel electrolyte facilitates the conversion reaction of Br0/Br−. Simultaneously, it activates the high voltage I+/I0 redox reaction through interhalogen formation. Consequently, sequential and highly reversible redox reactions involving I0/I−, I+/I0, and Br0/Br− are achieved with the assistance of −NR3+ units in BAVBr, effectively suppressing interhalogen hydrolysis in aqueous electrolyte. The cascade reactions lead to a high area capacity of 0.76 mAh cm−2 at a low I2 loading of 1 mg cm−2 or 760 mAh g−1 based on the mass of iodine, demonstrating exceptional long‐term cycling stability over a wide temperature range from −50 to 50 °C. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of electrolytes for high‐energy aqueous batteries, specifically tailored for wide‐temperature operation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A PD‐L1 siRNA‐loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD‐L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD‐L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD‐L1 inhibits intracellular PD‐L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT‐induced DNA damage but also maximizing T‐cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT‐immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B‐containing polymer that self‐assembled with PD‐L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD‐L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT‐immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD‐L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD‐L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T‐cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT‐induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD‐L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A comprehensive system‐level neural network‐assisted end‐to‐end design framework of meta‐optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual‐polarization multi‐wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi‐wavelength‐depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non‐orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized‐spectral multi‐information processing.








Abstract
Meta‐optics, with unique light‐matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi‐parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano‐structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high‐performance full‐light field control. Here, a neural network‐assisted end‐to‐end design framework that facilitates global, gradient‐based optimization of multifunctional meta‐optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi‐wavelength‐polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., ≈6 × structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full‐parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri‐polarization multi‐wavelength‐depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non‐orthogonal polarizations (>3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized‐spectral multi‐information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta‐optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next‐generation intelligent optical technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
MXenes are delaminated in a green organic solvent to achieve large flake size and polymer compatibility. PVDF composites are produced through non‐solvent‐induced phase separation to tune the structure and properties of thin‐film dielectric capacitors. MXenes with both mixed and pure chlorine terminations enhance the dielectric properties of PVDF, reaching energy density above 45 J cm−3 and 95% efficiency.








Abstract
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a semicrystalline polymer used in thin‐film dielectric capacitors because of its inherently high dielectric constant and low loss tangent. Its dielectric constant can be increased by the formation and alignment of its β‐phase crystalline structure, which can be facilitated by 2D nanofillers. 2D carbides and nitrides, MXenes, are promising candidates due to their notable dielectric permittivity and ability to increase interfacial polarization. Still, their mixing is challenging due to weak interfacial interactions and poor dispersibility of MXenes in PVDF. This work explores a novel method for delaminating Ti3C2Tx MXene directly into organic solvents while maintaining flake size and quality, as well as the use of a non‐solvent‐induced phase separation method for producing both dense and porous PVDF‐MXene composite films. A deeper understanding of dielectric behavior in these composites is reached by examining MXenes with both mixed and pure chlorine terminations in PVDF matrices. Thin‐film capacitors fabricated from these composites display ultrahigh discharge energy density, exceeding 45 J cm−3 with 95% efficiency. The PVDF‐MXene composites are also processed using a green and sustainable solvent, propylene carbonate.

This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self‐manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non‐invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self‐manipulating sodium ion gradient‐based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig‐EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non‐invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig‐EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig‐EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+‐ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig‐EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury‐associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig‐EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in‐sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire‐induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two‐order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization‐based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in‐sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In‐sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in‐sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric‐reconfigurable polarization‐sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in‐sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non‐volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state‐of‐the‐art polarization‐sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road‐scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

<title>Molecular Trojan Based on Membrane‐Mimicking Conjugated Electrolyte for Stimuli‐Responsive Drug Release</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multifunctional “Trojan” molecule based on membrane‐mimicking and zwitterionic conjugated electrolyte is developed for advanced drug delivery systems. By integrating into and rigidifying lipid bilayer structures, it prevents premature payload leakage and enables reliable in vivo visualization of carriers. Upon remote 808 nm excitation, this light‐responsive molecule triggers rapid drug release at tumor sites, inducing synergistic multimodal therapies.








Abstract
Enhancing payload encapsulation stability while enabling controlled drug release are both critical objectives in drug delivery systems but are challenging to reconcile. This study introduces a zwitterionic conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecule named Zwit, which acts as a molecular Trojan by mimicking the lipid bilayers. When integrated into liposome membranes, Zwit rigidifies the bilayer structure likely due to its hydrophobic interactions providing structural support, thus inhibiting drug leakage. Upon 808 nm laser excitation, Zwit rapidly accelerates DOX release from liposome core, likely due to light‐triggered conformational changes or photothermal effects that compromise membrane permeability. These findings demonstrate Zwit’s ability to overcome the challenge of simultaneously preventing premature payload leakage and enabling stimuli‐responsive drug release with a single component. Additionally, Zwit exhibits excellent biocompatibility with membranes, outperforming its quaternary ammonium counterpart and commonly used dye indocyanine green (ICG). By harnessing its NIR‐II emission, Zwit enables durable in vivo biodistribution tracking of nanocarriers, whereas ICG suffers from significant dye leakage. In subcutaneous tumor models, the synergistic effects of chemotherapy and thermotherapy facilitated by this light‐triggered system induced a potent antitumor immune response, further enhancing anticancer efficacy. This work underscores the potential of membrane‐mimicking CEs as multifunctional tools in advanced drug delivery systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A universal thick anode composed of polymer and carbon nanotubes has been developed, demonstrating stable operation across 15 simple‐ion and 3 complex‐ion systems. It achieves exceptional cycle life in supercapacitors, ultrahigh areal capacities in batteries, and high compatibility with seawater electrolytes. With ultrahigh‐loading capability (100 mg cm⁻2) and cost‐effectiveness, this thick electrode is promising for practical aqueous (seawater) energy devices.









Abstract
Aqueous and seawater energy storage devices hold great potential for electrical grids application due to safety, affordability, and sustainability. However, their broader deployment has been constrained by the absence of a durable thick anode. Here, the first universal thick anode operating stably across 15 simple‐ion and 3 complex‐ion systems, including nonmetallic (H+, NH4
+), monovalent (Li+, Na+, K+), multivalent ions (Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+), and seawater ions (>5 cations) is reported. Composed of polymer nanosheets and carbon nanotubes, this anode supports thick electrode fabrication (e.g., 100 mg cm−2 and 1 mm) with low porosity/tortuosity, superior electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness, and chemical stability. Consequently, it achieves exceptionable cycle life (up to 380 000 cycles) in supercapacitors and ultrahigh areal capacities (6.5 mAh cm−2) in batteries, even under practical/extreme conditions, attributed to the formation of a water‐scarce, cation‐rich electrical double‐layer structure, as revealed by simulations. Compatible with sea salt‐based electrolytes and paired with a metal‐free cathode, the anode enables seawater batteries with thousands‐cycle life and high energy/power density. Of universal ion storage, ultrahigh‐loading capability, unlimited resources, and cost‐effectiveness, this polymer electrode is promising for practical aqueous (seawater) energy devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance‐area product by integrating chemically vapor‐deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin‐orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy‐efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high‐performance spintronics but also paves the way for next‐generation low‐power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin‐orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field‐free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT‐memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor‐deposited two‐dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non‐volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect, achieving a low resistance‐area product (RA) of 15.5 kΩ·µm2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low‐power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti‐parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT‐memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT‐memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT‐memory with PMA field‐free switching.

<title>Glucose Metabolism‐Targeted Poly(amino acid) Nanoformulation of Oxaliplatin(IV)‐Aspirin Prodrug for Enhanced Chemo‐Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A glucose metabolism‐targeted nanoformulation (NP/OXA‐ASP2) is designed to inhibit lactate efflux while inducing mitochondrial stress to boost immunogenic cell death, thus synergistically reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by decreasing the proportion of immunosuppressive cells (Tregs and MDSCs) and increasing the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and plays an enhanced efficacy of chemo‐immunotherapy to colon cancer.








Abstract
Inappropriate glucose metabolism in cancer cells is associated with immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Although glycolysis inhibition enhances T cell‐mediated immune responses, the integrated platforms combining glycolysis inhibition with immunotherapy remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, a glucose metabolism‐targeted poly(amino acid) nanoformulation of oxaliplatin(IV)‐aspirin prodrug (NP/OXA‐ASP2) is developed to improve chemo‐immunotherapy by suppressing tumor glycolysis. This poly(amino acid) nanoparticle exhibits selective release, discharging 90.0% of OXA‐ASP2 under reductive conditions within 36 h. Furthermore, over 80% of the prodrug converts to OXA and ASP within 12 h, promoting mitochondrial damage and glycolysis inhibition, which amplifies immunogenic cell death induced by OXA. In addition, suppressing glycolytic flux reduces lactate leakage, mitigating the immunosuppressive TMEs. Together, these mechanisms contribute to stronger chemo‐immunotherapy efficacy. Compared to the OXA plus ASP formulation, NP/OXA‐ASP2 demonstrates superior performances, reducing lactate levels at the tumor site by 25.4%, increasing the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by 1.53 times, decreasing the proportion of regulatory T cells by 2.20 times, and improving 1.39‐fold of the tumor inhibition rate. These findings underscore that NP/OXA‐ASP2 is a promising platform for integrating tumor metabolic regulation with immunomodulation and holds significant potential for advancing clinical chemo‐immunotherapy.

<title>Tumor‐Targeted Glutamine Metabolism Blocker Synergizes with TiO2‐Au Janus Nanoparticles for Enhanced Sono‐Metabolic Antitumor Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sono‐metabolic nano‐composites (TiO2‐Au@DON) produce huge amounts of ROS (type I and type II) under ultrasound irradiation, effectively inducing immunogenic cell death via TiO2‐Au‐induced‐SDT phenomena. The released DON disrupts NADPH and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT‐mediated oxidative stress, offering a precise combination of SDT and immunotherapy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising therapeutic modality known for its non‐invasiveness, temporal‐spatial controllability, and deeper tissue penetration. However, the SDT treatment efficacy is still hampered by the scarcity of ideal sonosensitizers and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these challenges, a sono‐metabolic nano‐composite (TiO2‐Au@DON) using the metabolic reprogramming prodrugs of 6‐Diazo‐5‐oxo‐l‐norleucine (DON) grafted on TiO2‐Au Janus nanoparticles (NPs) is fabricated. The coupling of TiO2 and gold in the TiO2‐Au@DON effectively prevents the fast recombination of excited electrons and holes under ultrasound irradiation. The result is the generation of higher levels of both type I and II reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to pure TiO2, which helps overcome the limitations of SDT in the hypoxic TME. Furthermore, the TiO2‐Au Janus NPs act as nano‐carriers, delivering DON prodrugs to the tumor site. The released DON can disrupt nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming the metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT‐mediated oxidative stress, resulting in the increase of tumor sensitivity to ROS through TiO2‐Au@DON‐integrated synergistic effects of SDT and glutamine reprogramming strategies. This increased sensitivity ultimately induces robust immunogenic cell death (ICD), enhancing antitumor therapeutic efficacy and remodeling the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment.

These light‐driven 3D micromachines, fabricated using standard photolithography combined with direct laser writing, are assembled and actuated via programmable light patterns within an optoelectronic tweezers system. Utilizing charge‐induced repulsion and dielectrophoretic levitation effects, the micromachines enable highly efficient mechanical rotation and effective inter‐component motion transfer.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well‐ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long‐term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer‐by‐layer self‐assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl‐binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high‐affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of ≈140 and ≈40, respectively, while maintaining long‐term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high‐performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

A universal strategy to enhance the performance and mechanical stability of flexible perovskite near‐infrared (NIR) photodetector arrays is demonstrated through a combination of self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) bridging interface and stress release of nano‐array structure, presenting the maximum response wavelength of 1050 nm, a responsivity of 1.66 A W−1, detectivity of 6.19 × 1012 Jones, high fidelity imaging, and extra‐long environmental stability.








Abstract
Perovskite photodetectors with superior optoelectronic properties, lightweight, and compatibility with flexible substrates have attracted much attention in wearable electronics. However, the large bandgap, inherent brittleness, poor environmental stability, and weak interfacial adhesion interaction between perovskites and substrates hinder the application of near‐infrared (NIR) wearable devices. Herein, a universal strategy to enhance the performance and mechanical stability of flexible perovskite NIR photodetector arrays is demonstrated through a combination of mussel‐inspired self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) bridging interface and precise modulation of the nano‐array size, which enables to significantly increase interfacial adhesion, crystallinity, crystallographic orientation, and reduce mechanical stresses of perovskite single‐crystal arrays. Moreover, inserting paddle‐wheel metal–organic cluster ligands lead to an unprecedented small bandgap of 1.04 eV, enhanced lattice rigidity, and environmental stability for 2D perovskite. The flexible perovskite NIR photodetector arrays with superior mechanical robustness and record NIR performance are revealed with a maximum response wavelength of 1050 nm, a responsivity of 1.66 A W−1, detectivity of 6.19 × 1012 Jones, high fidelity imaging, and extra‐long environmental stability. This work pioneers a new insight into the integration of high‐performance and mechanically durable perovskite flexible wearable devices.

Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy‐efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86–1.32 g g−1 at 15–30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 °C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19 kg kg−1 day−1 by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The self‐switching enzyme‐like activity of the hydrogel activated by the hyperglycemia environment induces the opening of the hypoxia‐sensitive microcapsules, regulates the dynamic stability of blood glucose through intelligent insulin delivery. The hydrogel dynamically regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) through self‐switching enzyme‐like activity, produces ROS through peroxidase‐like activity to achieve antibacterial, and promotes infected diabetic wound healing by converting ROS to release oxygen.








Abstract
The defective blood glucose regulation ability of diabetic patients leading to bacterial infection, cellular oxidative stress, and vascular damage results in delayed healing of chronic diabetic wounds. Here, a glucose‐activated self‐switching enzyme‐like activity programmed hydrogel is proposed to provide self‐regulated timely intelligent insulin release affected by blood glucose fluctuations, thereby forming feedback blood glucose management and exerting a full‐stage wound healing. The hydrogel is composed of Au─MoS2─phenylboronic acid nanozyme and insulin‐loaded nitroimidazole‐modified sodium alginate hypoxia‐sensitive microcapsules and penylboronic‐acid‐modified chitosan. It utilizes glucose as a sacrificial agent to generate antibacterial reactive oxygen species by recognizing the hyperglycemia environment, and releasing insulin for blood glucose regulation for up to 12 h with the help of the enzyme‐like catalysis‐generated hypoxia environment. In a normoglycemia environment, the hydrogel switches the enzyme‐like activity to supply oxygen, inhibiting further insulin release. The hydrogel achieves ≈3 times the wound recovery rate of commercial dressings through blood glucose regulation and improved wound microenvironment. The hydrogel has been proven to significantly improve the healing of chronic diabetic wounds by regulating the body's blood glucose homeostasis and implementing a staged healing treatment plan, providing a powerful solution for diabetic wound care.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a comprehensive review of the synergistic integration of halide perovskite and rare‐earth ions toward photonics including structural features, optical properties, preparation methods, and photonic applications. Critical challenges and perspectives are introduced. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for perovskite and rare‐earth composites and their intriguing future application scenario.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs), emerging as a noteworthy class of semiconductors, hold great promise for an array of optoelectronic applications, including anti‐counterfeiting, light‐emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and photodetectors, primarily due to their large absorption cross section, high fluorescence efficiency, tunable emission spectrum within the visible region, and high tolerance for lattice defects, as well as their adaptability for solution‐based fabrication processes. Unlike luminescent HPs with band‐edge emission, trivalent rare‐earth (RE) ions typically emit low‐energy light through intra‐4f optical transitions, characterized by narrow emission spectra and long emission lifetimes. When fused, the cooperative interactions between HPs and REs endow the resulting binary composites not only with optoelectronic properties inherited from their parent materials but also introduce new attributes unattainable by either component alone. This review begins with the fundamental optoelectronic characteristics of HPs and REs, followed by a particular focus on the impact of REs on the electronic structures of HPs and the associated energy transfer processes. The advanced synthesis methods utilized to prepare HPs, RE‐doped compounds, and their binary composites are overviewed. Furthermore, potential applications are summarized across diverse domains, including high‐fidelity anticounterfeiting, bioimaging, LEDs, photovoltaics, photodetection, and photocatalysis, and conclude with remaining challenges and future research prospects.

Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80 cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

A material‐device‐algorithm co‐design strategy integrates an OFET array with in‐sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e‐noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material‐device‐algorithm co‐design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field‐effect transistor (OFET) array with in‐sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k‐nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs—among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e‐noses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial‐scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post‐treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high‐value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA‐K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high‐performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403 mA cm⁻2 at 1.40 V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA‐K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA‐K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial‐scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320 g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H₂, yielding 1200 g of AA‐K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.

<title>Atomically Engineered Trimetallic Nanoclusters Toward Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photoinitiation Activity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The central doping of Pd/Pt atoms and the surface‐motif doping of Cd atoms are concurrently achieved in trimetallic MAu18Cd3 (M = Pd/Pt) nanoclusters, which are synthesized via using the M‐doped Au25 template. This co‐doping strategy can significantly enhance the photoluminescence intensity and efficiency by affecting radiative relaxation and nonradiative relaxation pathways simultaneously.









Abstract
Precise doping is of vital significance for atomic engineering and the establishment of structure‐property relationships in nanocluster (NC) chemistry. Herein, two novel trimetallic MAu18Cd3 (M = Pd/Pt) NCs that are derived from M‐doped Au25 templates of MAu24 are reported, in which the central doping of M atom and the surface‐motif doping of Cd atoms are concurrently achieved. Compared to the original templates, Cd‐induced surface engineering enhances the rigidity of the structural framework and enlarges the HOMO‐LUMO gaps of the MAu18Cd3, significantly improving photoluminescent efficiency by suppressing nonradiative relaxation. The critical role of the central M (Pd/Pt) dopant in photoluminescence, which regulates the rate of radiative decay of excited‐state electrons, has also been substantiated. More notably, the doped case of PtAu18Cd3 exhibits excellent photoinitiation activity in 3D two‐photon printing with a high resolution of ≈140 nm, which may be attributed to the prolonged excited state. Overall, this work provides a generalized routine for the precise synthesis of multi‐metal NCs with concurrent enhancements in photoluminescence and photoinitiation activity, which is expected to stimulate further research for the design and preparation of multi‐functional, multi‐metal NCs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A grid‐like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist‐induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). It enables the as‐assembled supercapacitor with an ultra‐high energy density of 675 Wh kg−1 in KI‐mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine‐containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid‐like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist‐induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as‐fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and enables the as‐assembled supercapacitor with an ultra‐high energy density of 675 Wh kg−1 in redox‐active electrolyte (KI‐mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro‐activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox‐active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application‐inspired cutting‐edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

<title>Rapid and Large‐Scale Synthesis of High‐Crystalline Imide Covalent Organic Frameworks Accelerated by Self‐Generated Water</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419515?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419515?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low‐cost self‐accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent‐free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self‐healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self‐accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low‐cost, and large‐scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent‐free, vacuum‐free, and low‐temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self‐accelerated synthesis is driven by the self‐generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self‐healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o‐substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol‐functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as‐prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self‐accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low‐cost, and large‐scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The strategy of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signaling provides an emerging strategy for anti‐infective treatment. Here, the MOF nanocatalytic system induces a strong antibacterial response by triggering redox homeostasis imbalance in both of the bacteria and neutrophils, and initiate neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment.








Abstract
Strategies of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signals have revolutionized therapeutics involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, certain diseases with dual resistance barriers to the attacks by both ROS and immune cells, such as bacterial biofilm infections of medical implants, are difficult to eradicate by a single exogenous oxidative stimulus due to the diversity and complexity of the redox species involved. Here, this work demonstrates that metal‐organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles capable of disrupting the bacterial ROS‐defense system can dismantle bacterial redox resistance and induce potent antimicrobial immune responses in a mouse model of surgical implant infection by simultaneously modulating redox homeostasis and initiating neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment. Mechanistically, the piezoelectrically enhanced MOF triggers ROS production by tilting the band structure and acts synergistically with the aurintricarboxylic acid loaded within the MOF, which inhibits the activity of the cystathionine γ‐cleaving enzyme. This leads to biofilm structure disruption and antigen exposure through homeostatic imbalance and synergistic activation of neutrophil N1 polarization signals. Thus, this study provides an alternative but promising strategy for the treatment of antibiotic‐resistant biofilm infections.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using a prototypal platform of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymer–MOF hybrid sorbents, an optimal combination of surface hydrophobicity and strong electrostatics enables “parts per billion” removal of per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with record‐high kinetics and efficient sorbent regeneration. The expendable nature of guest‐accessible porosity for PFAS removal is established, underpinning a counterintuitive perspective on future adsorbent design.








Abstract
The confluence of pervasiveness, bioaccumulation, and toxicity in freshwater contaminants presents an environmental threat second to none. Exemplifying this trifecta, per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) present an alarming hazard among the emerging contaminants. State‐of‐the‐art PFAS adsorbents used in drinking water treatment, namely, activated carbons and ion‐exchange resins, are handicapped by low adsorption capacity, competitive adsorption, and/or slow kinetics. To overcome these shortcomings, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored pore size, surface, and pore chemistry are promising alternatives. Thanks to the compositional modularity of MOFs and polymer–MOF composites, herein we report on a series of water‐stable zirconium carboxylate MOFs and their low‐cost polymer‐grafted composites as C8–PFAS adsorbents with benchmark kinetics and “parts per billion” removal efficiencies. Bespoke insights into the structure–function relationships of PFAS adsorbents are obtained by leveraging interfacial design principles on solid sorbents, creating a synergy between the extrinsic particle surfaces and intrinsic molecular building blocks.

Achieving high‐performance all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) typically involves high fabrication pressure and operation pressure, which poses a significant challenge for the practical application of ASSBs. This review summarizes the pressure‐related challenges and strategies for ASSBs and offers perspectives on how to reduce fabrication and operation pressure. The insights aim to guide the design of low‐pressure ASSBs, thus facilitating their practical application.








Abstract
All‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) are regarded as promising next‐generation energy storage technology owing to their inherent safety and high theoretical energy density. However, achieving and maintaining solid–solid electronic and ionic contact in ASSBs generally requires high‐pressure fabrication and high‐pressure operation, posing substantial challenges for large‐scale production and application. In recent years, significant efforts are made to address these pressure‐related challenges. In this review, the impact of pressure on ASSBs is explored. First, the categories, origins, and challenges associated with pressure in ASSBs are outlined. Second, an overview of recent advancements in addressing pressure‐related issues in ASSBs is provided, focusing on electrode materials and their interfaces with various solid‐state electrolytes (SSEs). Third, advanced characterizations and simulations employed to unravel the intricate electrochemical–mechanical interactions in ASSBs are examined. Finally, existing strategies and the insights on achieving low‐stack‐pressure ASSBs are presented.

This review begins by summarizing various methods for fabricating freestanding inorganic‐based TE films, including leveraging the intrinsic plasticity of certain materials, exfoliating layered‐structure materials, using sacrificial substrates, and creating composites with flexible components such as polymers and carbon‐based materials. A key challenge in achieving high device performance is determining how to maintain the favorable TE properties of inorganic materials. This can be addressed through strategies such as high inorganic content loading, multicomponent engineering, and interfacial structure design. The review also discusses the applications of substrate‐free inorganic‐based TE devices in both power generation and solid‐state cooling. Finally, it outlines current challenges and proposes potential research directions to further advance the field.

<title>Orbital Current Pumping From Ultrafast Light‐driven Antiferromagnetic Insulator</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator α‐Fe2O3 via terahertz emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. This phenomenon occurs when the magnonic orbital moment of the antiferromagnetic insulator α‐Fe2O3 is excited by the ultrafast laser, resulting in the pumping of orbital current into Pt/CuOx interface. 








Abstract
The orbital Hall effect originating from light materials with weak spin‐orbit coupling, has attracted considerable interest in spintronic applications. Recent studies demonstrate that orbital currents can be generated from charge currents through the orbital Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials. However, the generation of orbital currents in antiferromagnets has so far been elusive. In this work, this is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator α‐Fe2O3 via terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. A significant increase in THz signal is obtained in α‐Fe2O3/Pt/CuOx heterostructure compared to that of α‐Fe2O3/Pt, with the maximum value occurring at a Pt thickness of 2 nm. The enhancement of the THz signal is attributed to the fact that magnons injected into Pt excite a coupled spin‐orbital current that flows toward the Pt/CuOx interface, aside from the spin‐to‐charge conversion in the Pt layer. The magnetoresistance contains the conventional spin‐Hall magnetoresistance contributed by the Pt layer and an additional orbital contribution from the Pt/CuOx interface. The Pt/CuOx interface generates an orbital current and absorbs the orbital accumulation, similar to the orbital‐Hall magnetoresistance. This finding provides a rich platform for orbital‐to‐charge conversion and opens an interdisciplinary field of antiferromagnetic orbitronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on deterministic characteristics in the structuring of materials via additive manufacturing, crystals can be grown in an active and interactive manner, which realizes spatiotemporal programming and reprogramming of crystals. In the present study, snowflake‐like camphor crystals are demonstrated with their real‐time seeding and reprogramming via in situ, localized photopolymerization of mixture systems, which launches an era of active crystallization.









Abstract
Additive manufacturing has sought active and interactive means of creating predictable structures with diverse materials. Compared to such active manufacturing tools, current crystallization strategies remain in statistical and passive programs of crystals via macroscale thermodynamic controllers, commonly lacking active means to intervene in crystal growth in a spatiotemporal manner. Herein, a strategy toward active and interactive programming and reprogramming of crystals, realized by real‐time tangible feedback on growing crystals by delicately controlling the degree of in‐situ, localized photopolymerization of polymeric structures via additive manufacturing is presented. Using this strategy, crystals can be seeded, guided, and even reprogrammed in a supersaturated liquid resin. In principle, the localized formation of sparse polymeric networks within supercooled resins can induce density fluctuation to trigger seed nucleation instantaneously, whereas the formation of dense networks can lower molecules’ mobilities to inhibit crystal growth. Assisted by these active triggers and deterministic procedural aspects in additive manufacturing, growing crystals can be tangibly interacted through programmed polymeric structures, strengthening deterministic characteristics in crystal growth. It is suggested that crystal growth can be programmable with deterministic hierarchies within the created crystal's morphologies within the background of inherent stochasticity in crystallization, launching an era of convolutional growth of crystals.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Perovskite quantum dots with efficient scintillating luminescence are incorporated in glass fibers with low‐loss waveguiding, enabling remote, real‐time radiation detection. More importantly, the scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array with controlled thickness and length for use in remote pixilated X‐ray imaging.








Abstract
The emerging metal halide perovskites are challenging the traditional scintillators in the field of radiation detection and radiography. However, they lack the capability for remote and real‐time radiation monitoring and imaging in confined and hostile conditions. To address this issue, details on an inorganic scintillating glass fiber incorporating perovskite quantum dots (QDs) as highly efficient pixelated radiation emitters are reported, while the glass fibers themselves serve at the same time as low‐loss waveguides, enabling long‐distance and underwater X‐ray detection. The multi‐color emissions and controllable radiation sensitivities endow CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) QD scintillating glass fibers with the potential as wearable and visualized radiation indicators. Furthermore, these scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array plate with a thickness of 7.5 mm to enhance X‐ray absorption for X‐ray imaging. Leveraging the light‐guiding character of glass fibers, a 5 × 5 fiber array with fiber lengths up to 11 cm has demonstrated the potential of remote pixelated X‐ray imaging. This study offers a novel platform for the development of remote detectors and imagers for X‐ray radiation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel unidirectional freeze‐casting method fabricates a Poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)‐facilitated, vertically aligned MXene aerogel, enhancing chemoresistive sensing performance. The structure maximizes surface area, forms interfacial heterostructures, and modulates electron mobility, achieving high sensitivity, broad detection range, and stability. Biocompatible and flexible, the sensor functions as a reliable alcohol breathalyzer and skin‐mountable device for chemical sensing.








Abstract
MXene has garnered growing interest in the field of electrochemistry, thanks to its unique electrical and surface characteristics. Nonetheless, significant challenges persist in realizing its full potential in chemoresistive sensing applications. In this study, a novel unidirectional freeze‐casting approach for fabricating a Poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)‐facilitated vertically aligned MXene‐based aerogel with enhanced chemoresistive sensing properties was introduced. Firstly, the persistent challenge of poor gelation in MXene was addressed by formulating a nanohybrid of MXene and PEDOT:PSS, which acted as flexible conductive nanobinder. Employing a unique freeze‐casting method, MXene flakes interconnected by PEDOT:PSS, were stabilized into a flexible, vertically aligned structure, leading to maximum surface exposure and enhanced robustness. The resulting 3‐dimentional (3‐D) aerogel exhibited a fast, heightened chemoresistive response of 7 to 50 parts per million (ppm) acetone and expanded the working range to between 10 parts per billion (ppb)‐8000 ppm. Interfacial heterostructures formed between MXene and PEDOT:PSS, provided active sites, reduced activation energy, and enhanced selectivity. Modulated MXene bandgap, and its electron mobility further facilitated electron transfer, and enhanced signal strength. The sensor showed excellent biocompatibility and was also successfully employed as a breathalyzing tool, for on‐demand alcohol consumption monitoring.

<title>Low Thermal Conductivity and Diffusivity at High Temperatures Using Stable High‐Entropy Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Low thermal diffusivity at high temperature (800 °C) is achieved using packed nanoparticles of high‐entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations with low thermal conductivity and relatively high packing density of ≈50 %. The high entropy leads to remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures, thus enabling the low thermal conductivity of the packed nanoparticles.








Abstract
The realization of low thermal conductivity at high temperatures (0.11 W m−1 K−1 800 °C) in ambient air in a porous solid thermal insulation material, using stable packed nanoparticles of high‐entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations (HESO‐8 NPs) with a relatively high packing density of ≈50%, is reported. The high‐density HESO‐8 NP pellets possess around 1000‐fold lower thermal diffusivity than that of air, resulting in much slower heat propagation when subjected to a transient heat flux. The low thermal conductivity and diffusivity are realized by suppressing all three modes of heat transfer, namely solid conduction, gas conduction, and thermal radiation, via stable nanoconstriction and infrared‐absorbing nature of the HESO‐8 NPs, which are enabled by remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures due to the high entropy. This work can elucidate the design of the next‐generation high‐temperature thermal insulation materials using high‐entropy ceramic nanostructures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Eight chemiluminescence (CL) probes with a malononitrile group are easily synthesized by introducing donors to regulate HClO‐activated CL emissions from 600 to 750 nm, with comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations supporting a concerted decomposition of the oxidized CL molecule, achieving high‐contrast imaging of acute inflammation in vivo with a high signal‐to‐background ratio (SBR) of 24.77.









Abstract
Chemiluminescence (CL) imaging has emerged as a powerful approach to molecular imaging that allows exceptional sensitivity with virtually no background interference because of its unique capacity to emit photons without an external excitation source. Despite its high potential, the application of this nascent technique faces challenges because the current chemiluminescent agents have limited reactive sites, require complex synthesis, are insufficiently bright, and lack near‐infrared emission. Herein, a series of HClO‐activated chemiluminescent probes that exhibit robust near‐infrared emission are studied. Specifically engineered to respond to HClO, a known biomarker of acute inflammation, these probes achieve high‐contrast in vivo imaging by eliminating the need for constant external excitation. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the CL of the probes depends on the reactivity of the vinylene bonds, following a concerted decomposition of the oxidized chemiluminescent molecule. The application of these chemiluminescent nanoparticles in vivo facilitates high‐contrast imaging of acute inflammation, providing real‐time, high‐contrast visualization of inflammatory conditions. This advancement signifies a leap forward for chemiluminescent nanoplatforms in biomedical imaging and expands the available methodologies in this field.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Wireless nanoelectrodes made of electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are anchored to the membrane of neural stem cells to enable their migration together with the cells and precise extracellular electrical stimulation to the membrane receptors under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode‐mediated electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of stem cells into specifical dopaminergic neurons and improves the repair of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. Neural‐stem‐cell (NSC)‐based therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of PD but its therapeutic performance is limited by low efficiency of differentiation of NSCs to dopaminergic neurons. Although electrical stimulation can promote neuronal differentiation, it is not verified whether it can induce the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons. Meanwhile, it is a great challenge to precisely apply electrical stimulation to dynamically migrating NSCs after transplantation. Here, electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are designed to anchor to the membrane of NSCs to serve as wireless nanoelectrodes. After anchoring to the cell membrane, these nanoelectrodes are able to migrate together with the cells and precisely apply extracellular electrical stimulation to the receptors or ion transport channels on the membrane of transplanted cells under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode‐mediated electrical stimulation induces 38.46% of the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons, while the percentage is only 5.82% for NSCs without the nanoelectrode stimulation. Transplantation of NSCs anchored with the nanoelectrodes effectively improves the recovery of the motor and memory ability of PD mice under alternating magnetic field within 2 weeks.

This study presents a mild strategy to synthesis of mild‐photothermal responsive and NO donor Prussian blue nanozymes for inflammation regulation and bacterial eradication in periodontal disease.








Abstract
Periodontitis, an infectious disease of periodontal tissues caused by oral bacterial biofilms, is characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and immune microenvironment imbalance. Multifunctional nanozymes, leveraging their physiochemical properties and enzymatic activities, offer promising antibacterial and anti‐inflammatory strategies for managing periodontitis. In particular, Prussian blue nanozymes (PBzymes) exhibit exceptional ROS control due to their robust catalytic activity, diverse antioxidant functions, and high biocompatibility. However, the practical application of traditional high‐temperature synthesis methods is limited. This study introduces a class of metal‐engineered PBzymes synthesized at room temperature, identified for their potent antioxidative activity and excellent photothermal performance at mild temperatures. Nitric oxide (NO) gas therapy offers promising strategies for targeting deep infections in periodontal tissues. Thus, sodium nitroprusside is introduced into PBzyme to create SPBzyme via an in situ loading method. NO release by SPBzyme enhances antibacterial effects and overcomes resistance linked to bacterial biofilms, resulting in mild‐photothermal antibacterial properties and synergistic antioxidant effects. In vitro antibacterial assays demonstrate the superior efficacy of SPBzyme under mild temperature conditions and near‐infrared light exposure. Furthermore, SPBzyme effectively reduces inflammation and has positive therapeutic effects in periodontal animal models. Overall, mild‐temperature photothermal NO release nanozyme therapy represents a novel approach for treating periodontitis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Polyanionic electrolyte ionization functionalisation via layer‐by‐layer deposition as desalination strategy is implemented here to a localized thermal solar evaporator empowering continuous evaporation over extended periods of time and under real sweater from the Yellow Sea and from the East China Sea.








Abstract
Solar evaporation contributes to sustainable and environmentally friendly production of fresh water from seawater and wastewater. However, poor salt resistance and high degree of corrosion of traditional evaporators in brine make their implementation in real applications scarce. To overcome such deficiency, a polyanionic electrolyte functionalization strategy empowering excellent uniform desalination performance over extended periods of time is exploited. This 3D superhydrophilic graphene oxide solar evaporator design ensures stable water supply by the enhanced self‐driving liquid capillarity and absorption at the evaporation interface as well as efficient vapor diffusion. Meanwhile, the polyanionic electrolyte functionalization implemented via layer‐by‐layer static deposition of polystyrene sodium sulfonate effectively regulates/minimizes the flux of salt ions by exploiting the Donnan equilibrium effect, which eventually hinders local salt crystallization during long‐term operation. Stable evaporation rates in line with the literature of up to 1.68 kg m−2 h−1 are achieved for up to 10 days in brine (15‰ salinity) and for up to 3 days in seawater from Hangzhou Bay in the East China Sea (9‰ salinity); while, maintaining evaporation efficiencies of ≈90%. This work demonstrates the excellent benefits of polyanionic electrolyte functionalization as salt resistance strategy for the development of high‐performance solar powered seawater desalination technology and others.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A two‐terminal metaplastic resistive memory device is developed by combining graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with iron oxide (FeOx). This research contributes to the field of neuromorphic computing by providing a scalable and reconfigurable hardware solution that effectively integrates metaplasticity into artificial synaptic devices, addressing the problem of catastrophic forgetting in current neural network architectures.









Abstract
The limitations of deep neural networks in continuous learning stem from oversimplifying the complexities of biological neural circuits, often neglecting the dynamic balance between memory stability and learning plasticity. In this study, artificial synaptic devices enhanced with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) that exhibit metaplasticity is introduced, a higher‐order form of synaptic plasticity that facilitates the dynamic regulation of memory and learning processes similar to those observed in biological systems. The GQDs‐assisted devices utilize interface‐mediated modifications in asymmetric conductive pathways, replicating classical synaptic plasticity mechanisms. This allows for repeatable and linearly programmable adjustments to future weight changes linked to historical weights. Incorporating metaplasticity is essential for achieving generalization within deep neural networks, which enables them to adapt more fluidly to new information while retaining previously acquired knowledge. The GQDs‐device‐based system achieved a 97% accuracy on the fourth MNIST dataset task, while consistently achieving performance levels above 94% on prior tasks. This performance substantiates the feasibility of directly transferring metaplasticity principles to deep neural networks, thereby addressing the challenges associated with catastrophic forgetting. These findings present a promising hardware solution for developing neuromorphic systems with robust and sustained learning capabilities that can effectively bridge the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.

HA‐NCSN/Cu is a new type of hydrogel formed by reducing crosslinking, which shows multi‐functions such as injectable, self‐healing, reactive oxygen species clearance, photothermal properties, and so on. The successful application of HA‐NCSN/Cu in combination with mild photothermal therapy in the treatment of disc degeneration strongly proves its promising application potential.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is characterized by fibrosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accelerated surrounding extracellular matrix catabolism. Bioactive hydrogels have shown significant potential in regulating cellular functions and tissue homeostasis. In this work, a dynamic hydrogel (HA‐NCSN/Cu) is designed via the reductive chelation of hyaluronic acid grafted with thiourea (HA‐NCSN) and Cu2+. The reductivity of the grafted thiourea groups of HA‐NCSN can quickly reduce part of the chelated Cu2+ to Cu+. Therefore, during the gelation process, the color of hydrogel become dark immediately, which endowed hydrogel with remarkable photothermal effect. The abundant thiourea groups inside hydrogel can effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species to mitigate the inflammatory stress of NP cells. RNA sequencing analysis further reveals that glutathione signaling pathway is significantly altered. Meanwhile, mild photothermal therapy could activate the TGF‐β/Smad pathway in NP cells, promoting the expression and secretion of Aggrecan and Collagen II. Ultimately, the combined modulation of inflammation alleviation and matrix regeneration achieves the restoration of the structure and function of the damaged intervertebral disc, which is also strongly demonstrated by the in vivo animal experiments. All of these results demonstrate the great potential of the dynamic HA‐NCSN/Cu hydrogel in IVDD treatment.

An antigen‐adjuvant spatiotemporally‐synchronized multi‐epitope nanovaccine, termed as CM‐CpG‐aCD40, is constructed by conjugating the immune stimulative CpG oligonucleotide and the anti‐CD40 antibody (aCD40) onto the membrane vesicles derived from triple negative breast cancer cells. The nanovaccine improves the antibody‐secreting and antigen‐presenting abilities of B cells, providing a multi‐pronged approach to activation of antitumor immune responses.








Abstract
B lymphocytes have emerged as an important immune‐regulating target. Inoculation with tumor cell membrane‐derived vaccines is a promising strategy to activate B cells, yet their efficiency is limited due to lack of costimulatory molecules. To amplify B cell responses against tumor, herein, a spatiotemporally‐synchronized antigen‐adjuvant integrated nanovaccine, termed as CM‐CpG‐aCD40, is constructed by conjugating the immune stimulative CpG oligonucleotide and the anti‐CD40 antibody (aCD40) onto the membrane vesicles derived from triple negative breast cancer cells. CM‐CpG‐aCD40 actively accumulates in lymph nodes and is effectively captured by antigen‐presenting cells via the recognition of CD40 by aCD40. Tumor antigens on CM‐CpG‐aCD40 bind to B cell receptors, providing the first stimulation signal for B cells. Meanwhile, the interaction between CpG/Toll like receptor and aCD40/CD40 provides superposed co‐stimulation signals, improving the antibody‐secreting and antigen‐presenting abilities of B cells. The nanovaccine also stimulates dendritic cells to activate CD8+ T cells, and reprograms tumor associated macrophages. CM‐CpG‐aCD40 activating humoral, cellular, and innate antitumor immunity achieves a tumor inhibition rate of 89.3%, which is further improved to 95.4% when combined with the anti‐programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) antibody. CM‐CpG‐aCD40, as a personalized multi‐epitope nanovaccine, paves the way for ushering the era of B cell‐based immunotherapy.

This study demonstrates the three‐step domain switching characteristic in Hf1−xZrxO2 thin films with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric coupling, in the form of triple‐peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. By fully switching individual peaks in the triple‐peak EC distribution, the long‐sought reliable operation of 3‐bit per cell are realized in the Hf1−xZrxO2 films, including high endurance, small device‐to‐device variation, and long data retention.








Abstract
HfO2‐based multi‐bit ferroelectric memory combines non‐volatility, speed, and energy efficiency, rendering it a promising technology for massive data storage and processing. However, some challenges remain, notably polarization variation, high operation voltage, and poor endurance performance. Here we show Hf1−xZrxO2 (x = 0.65 to 0.75) thin films grown through sequential atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO2 and ZrO2 exhibiting three‐step domain switching characteristic in the form of triple‐peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. This long‐sought behavior shows nearly no changes even at up to 125 °C and after 1 × 108 electric field cycling. By combining the electrical characterizations and integrated differential phase‐contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC‐STEM), we reveal that the triple‐peak EC distribution is driven by the coupling of ferroelectric switching and reversible antiferroelectric–ferroelectric transition. We further demonstrate the 3‐bit per cell operation of the Hf1−xZrxO2 capacitors with excellent device‐to‐device variation and long data retention, by the full switching of individual peaks in the triple‐peak EC. The work represents a significant step in implementing reliable non‐volatile multi‐state ferroelectric devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A library of seed@high‐entropy‐alloy core–shell nanocrystals with up to ten elements and well‐defined facets are synthesized via seed‐mediated growth. Several facet‐dependent catalytic activities are identified in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, with active sites determined by in situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and density‐functional theory. This work advances facet engineering in a multi‐elemental scope and unveils the potential for catalysis.








Abstract
High‐entropy‐alloy (HEA) nanocrystals hold immense potential for catalysis, offering virtually unlimited alloy combinations through the inclusion of at least five constituent elements in varying ratios. However, general and effective strategies for synthesizing libraries of HEA nanocrystals with controlled surface atomic structures remain scarce. In this study, a transferable strategy for developing a library of facet‐controlled seed@HEA nanocrystals through seed‐mediated growth is presented. The synthesis of seed@HEA core–shell nanocrystals incorporating up to ten different metallic elements, with control over the number of solid‐solution HEA atomic layers is demonstrated. Epitaxial HEA growth on nanocrystal seeds with low‐index and high‐index facets leads to the formation of seed@HEA catalyst library with composition‐ and facet‐dependent catalytic activities in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In situ synchrotron X‐ray absorption spectroscopy and density‐functional theory calculations are employed to identify surface active sites of the HEA, rationalizing the high level of catalytic activities achieved. This work enables facet engineering in the multi‐elemental chemical space and unveils the critical needs for their future development toward catalysis.

<title>Photoimmunologic Therapy of Stubborn Biofilm via Inhibiting Bacteria Revival and Preventing Reinfection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An oligo‐ethylene glycol‐modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer is developed for photoimmunologic therapy of stubborn biofilm. It not only downregulates the two‐component system, quorum sensing, and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth, and accelerating wound healing but also triggers immunogenetic cell death to promote short‐term immune and long‐term immunological memory enhancement for coping with secondary infections.








Abstract
Stubborn biofilm infections pose serious threats to public health. Clinical practices highly rely on mechanical debridement and antibiotics, which often fail and lead to persistent and recurrent infections. The main culprits are 1) persistent bacteria reviving, colonizing, and rejuvenating biofilms, and 2) secondary pathogen exposure, particularly in individuals with chronic diseases. Addressing how to inhibit persistent bacteria revival and prevent reinfection simultaneously is still a major challenge. Herein, an oligo‐ethylene glycol‐modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer (PS), TBTCP‐PEG7, is developed. It effectively eradicates Methicillin‐Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) under light irradiation. Furthermore, TBTCP‐PEG7‐mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only conquers stubborn biofilm infections by downregulating the two‐component system (TCS), quorum sensing (QS), and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth and biofilm remodeling but also prevents reinfection by upregulating heat shock protein‐related genes to induce immunogenetic cell death (ICD) and establish immune memory. In vivo, TBTCP‐PEG7 efficiently eradicates MRSA biofilm adhered to medical catheters, stimulates angiogenesis, reduces inflammatory factor expression, and accelerates wound healing. Furthermore, ICD promotes short‐term immune and long‐term immunological memory for coping with secondary infections. This two‐pronged strategy not only effectively overcomes stubborn, persistent and recurrent biofilm infection, but also provides theoretical guidance for designing the next generation of antibacterial materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by the rapid regeneration of antlers, HAMA hydrogel as a carrier for incorporating EVsABPCs into antler‐DCB is utilized. Notably, the antler‐DCB@EVsABPCs showed a strong ability to recruit endogenous BMSCs and transformed them an ABPC‐like cells, thereby facilitating rapid bone formation. Additionally, the bone graft triggered bone growth coordinated with angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and immunomodulation, which partially imitating early phase antlerogenesis.








Abstract
Adult mammals are unable to regenerate bulky bone tissues, making large bone defects clinically challenging. Deer antler represents an exception to this rule, exhibiting the fastest bony growth in mammals, offering a unique opportunity to explore novel strategies for rapid bone regeneration. Here, a bone graft exploiting the biochemical, biophysical, and structural characteristics of antlers is constructed. It is decellularized antler cancellous bone (antler‐DCB) to obtain a bone scaffold. Then, an antler‐based bone graft is constructed by integrating antler‐DCB with antler‐derived biological signals, delivered by extracellular vesicles (EVs) from antler blastema progenitor cells (ABPCs), a novel stem cells responsible for antlerogenesis is discovered. The antler‐based bone graft transformed bone marrow stromal cells into cells with an ABPC‐like phenotype and transcriptomic signature. In vivo, the antler‐based graft triggered rapid bone formation in a rat model, with doubled volume of newly formed bones than commercial DCBs. In addition, the antler‐based graft orchestrated a coordinated process of vascularization, neurogenesis, and immunomodulation during osteogenesis, partially imitating early antlerogenesis. These findings provide practical insights to develop a therapeutic intervention for treating severe bone defects.

<title>Stabilizing Electron Transport of 2D Materials</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D materials are a potential candidate for beyond‐silicon electronics. However, the stability is one of the key bottlenecks in the progress of 2D materials. Here, a strategy is developed that greatly improves the performance and stability of 2D materials and devices by using vitamin C. The increase in mobility is more than ten times, and the performance can be maintained in air conditions for more than 327 days.








Abstract
2D materials are promising candidates for beyond‐Si electronic devices. However, their stability is a key bottleneck in their industrial applications. The instability of 2D materials is mainly attributed to their intrinsic susceptibility to O2 and H2O—particularly to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have strong oxidizing properties. Inspired by the antioxidant effect of vitamin C (VC) in organisms, a strategy based on the use of VC to stabilize electron transport in 2D materials is developed, which significantly improves the performance and stability of these materials and devices. The mobility is increased by more than an order of magnitude, and excellent performance of the device is maintained in air for >327 days, which is the best reported stability for MoS2 field‐effect transistors to date. VC scavenges existing ROS via oxidation reactions and inhibits the generation of ROS by shielding excitons from oxygen quenching, which provides 2D materials lasting protection from electron trapping and oxidative damage, stabilizing electron transport. This approach, which is based on the simple utilization of readily available VC, has considerable potential for large‐scale applications in the 2D material electronics industry.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Adenosine triphosphate‐tagged pro‐proteins are engineered to form stable nanocomplexes with guanidyl‐rich, α‐helical polypeptide and enable robust cytosolic delivery. By delivering ribonucleoprotein, this system induces pronounced genome editing against hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α after intravitreal injection, inhibiting neovascularization and subretinal fibrosis in choroidal neovascularization mice.









Abstract
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP)‐based CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing holds great potential for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which however, is challenged by the lack of efficient cytosolic protein delivery tools. Herein, reversibly‐phosphorylated pro‐proteins (P‐proteins) with conjugated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) tags are engineered and coupled with a membrane‐penetrating, guanidine‐enriched, α‐helical polypeptide (LGP) to mediate robust and universal cytosolic delivery. LGP forms salt‐stable nanocomplexes (NCs) with P‐proteins via electrostatic interaction and salt bridging, and the helix‐assisted, strong membrane activities of LGP enabled efficient cellular internalization and endolysosomal escape of NCs. Therefore, this approach allows efficient cytosolic delivery of a wide range of protein cargoes and maintains their bioactivities due to endolysosomal acidity‐triggered traceless restoration of P‐proteins. Notably, intravitreally delivered LGP/P‐RNP NCs targeting hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) induce pronounced gene disruption to downregulate pro‐angiogenic factors and alleviate subretinal fibrosis, ultimately provoking robust therapeutic efficacy in CNV mice. Such a facile and versatile platform provides a powerful tool for cytosolic protein delivery and genome editing, and it holds promising potential for the treatment of CNV‐associated diseases, such as age‐related macular degeneration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ionic diode‐based drug delivery system is demonstrated, which uses electric potential for spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained drug release with minimal leakage. It provides flow‐free drug delivery at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. In a tumor‐bearing mouse model, it shows superior anti‐tumor efficacy and reduced off‐target immune toxicity compared to intratumoral drug injection.








Abstract
Drug delivery systems hold promise for delivering cytotoxic drugs by controlling the timing and location of the drug release. However, conventional delivery mechanisms often fall short of achieving spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained release, which is crucial for ensuring drug efficacy and minimizing impact on surrounding tissues. Here, an ionic diode‐based drug delivery system is reported that is controlled by an electric potential and capable of releasing drugs at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. The migrated drug is slowly but continuously diffused to the lesion through the hydrogel at the desired rate. The ionic diode provides flow‐free drug delivery while minimizing unintended drug leakage over prolonged periods. Implanted in a freely moving tumor‐bearing mouse model, the system filled with doxorubicin demonstrated superior anti‐tumor efficacy and minimal off‐target immune toxicity compared to the intratumoral injection of free doxorubicin. With its mechanically compliant and biocompatible components, the system offers a safe and readily translatable approach to patients with surgically unresectable tumors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The non‐equilibrium microwave‐powered liquid metal depolymerization is proposed for converting various polyolefin wastes into high‐value olefin monomers and narrowband hydrocarbon oils by introducing. By leveraging the self‐separation feature of liquid metals and their exceptional chemical‐bond activation ability under microwave field, an unprecedented high turnover frequency of 2.83 kgPlastic mLLiquid metal−1 is achieved.








Abstract
Upcycling waste plastics is highly promising to tackle global white pollution while achieving sustainable development. However, prevailing approaches often encounter challenges in scalable engineering practices due to either insufficient plastic upcycling capability or arduousness in the separation, recovery, and purification of catalysts, which inevitably augments the cost of plastic upcycling. Here, the microwave‐powered liquid metal synergetic depolymerization is presented to facilitate low‐cost plastic upcycling. By leveraging the fluidity of liquid metals and their exceptional chemical‐bond activation ability under microwave field, this method efficiently converts various polyolefins into narrowband hydrocarbon oil (Oil yield: 81 wt.% for polypropylene (PP), 85.9 wt.% for polyethylene (PE)) and high‐value olefin monomers (C2‐4 selectivity: 50% for PE, 65.3% for PP) over 30 successive cycles, resulting in a high turnover frequency of 2.83 kgPlastic mLLiquid metal−1. These captivating advantages offered by electromagnetically‐powered liquid metals are also supported by their self‐separation features, thereby paving the way for large‐scale engineering solutions in waste plastic upcycling.

<title>Toward Long‐Life High‐Voltage Aqueous Li‐Ion Batteries: from Solvation Chemistry to Solid‐Electrolyte‐Interphase Layer Optimization Against Electron Tunneling Effect</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel acetamide‐based eutectic electrolyte with enhanced solvation chemistry design, combined with a widened operation voltage range to induce hydrogen evolution reaction, forms a robust solid‐electrolyte‐interphase layer, mitigating electron tunneling and significantly improving the cycle stability of high‐voltage aqueous Li‐ion batteries.








Abstract
Water is pursued as an electrolyte solvent for its non‐flammable nature compared to traditional organic solvents, yet its narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) limits its performance. Solvation chemistry design is widely adopted as the key to suppress the reactivity of water, thereby expanding the ESW. In this study, an acetamide‐based ternary eutectic electrolyte achieved an ESW ranging from 1.4 to 5.1 V. The electrolyte confines water molecules within the primary solvation sheath of Li‐ions, reducing the free water and breaking the hydrogen bond network. Despite this, initial capacity retention is suboptimal due to inadequate formation of solid‐electrolyte‐interphase (SEI) layers. To address this, additional hydrogen evolution reaction is induced by widening the operation voltage range, thereby optimizing the SEI layer to mitigate the electron tunneling effect. This approach resulted in a denser LiF‐rich SEI layer, effectively preventing water decomposition and improving long‐term cycle stability. The optimized SEI layer reduced the electron tunneling barrier, achieving a discharge capacity of 152 mAh g−1 at 1 C and maintaining 76% of its capacity (116 mAh g−1) after 1000 cycles. This study highlights the critical role of both solvation structure and SEI layer optimization in enhancing the performance of high‐voltage aqueous Li‐ion batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A vascularized patient‐derived tumor organoid (PDTO)‐on‐a‐chip with a hierarchical, tumor‐specific microvasculature is developed, enabling high‐resolution, real‐time visualization of dynamic interactions within the tumor's perivascular niche. This platform effectively models tumor‐driven angiogenesis and migration, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for assessing metastatic risk and guiding clinical strategies.








Abstract
While tumor organoids have revolutionized cancer research by recapitulating the cellular architecture and behaviors of real tumors in vitro, their lack of functional vasculature hinders their attainment of full physiological capabilities. Current efforts to vascularize organoids are struggling to achieve well‐defined vascular networks, mimicking the intricate hierarchy observed in vivo, which restricts the physiological relevance particularly for studying tumor progression and response to therapies targeting the tumor vasculature. An innovative vascularized patient‐derived tumor organoids (PDTOs)‐on‐a‐chip with hierarchical, tumor‐specific microvasculature is presented, providing a versatile platform to explore tumor‐vascular dynamics and antivascular drug efficacy. It is found that highly metastatic tumor cells induced vessel angiogenesis and simultaneously migrated toward blood vessels via the Notch pathway. The evident association between the angiogenic and migratory capacities of PDTOs and their clinical metastatic outcomes underscores the potential of the innovative platform for evaluating tumor metastasis, thus offering valuable insights for clinical decision‐making. Ultimately, the system represents a promising avenue for advancing the understanding of tumor metastasis and developing personalized treatment strategies based on patient‐specific tumor characteristics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A method of electrochemical pulsing which forms a spinel‐like δ phase in Mn‐rich disordered rocksalt materials with Li‐excess (DRX) (DRX) cathode materials is demonstrated. This concept is extended to large single‐crystalline particles, greatly improving the cycling stability. X‐ray diffraction, scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) and atomic resolution STEM‐HAADF were used to reveal a nanodomain spinel structure separated by antiphase boundaries.









Abstract
Mn‐rich disordered rocksalt materials with Li‐excess (DRX) materials have emerged as a promising class of earth‐abundant and energy‐dense next‐generation cathode materials for lithium‐ion batteries. Recently, an electrochemical transformation to a spinel‐like “δ” phase has been reported in Mn‐rich DRX materials, with improved capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability compared with previous DRX compositions. However, this transformation unfolds slowly over the course of cycling, complicating the development and understanding of these materials. In this work, it is reported that the transformation of Mn‐rich DRX materials to the promising δ phase can be promoted to occur much more rapidly by electrochemical pulsing at elevated temperature, rate, and voltage. To extend this concept, micron‐sized single‐crystal DRX particles are also transformed to the δ phase by the same method, possessing greatly improved cycling stability in the first demonstration of cycling for large, single‐crystal DRX particles. To shed light on the formation and specific structure of the δ phase, X‐ray diffraction, scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) and atomic resolution STEM‐HAADF are used to reveal a nanodomain spinel structure with minimal remnant disorder.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented, achieved through structural design of a non‐stretching material and over‐electrodeposition of PEDOT:PSS. sMEA enables tight contact with organoids despite exposure to buoyant force in medium, resulting in electrophysiological signals with a high signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR). High SNR signals allow for non‐invasive functional assessment of the organoids for drug screening.








Abstract
Organoids are 3D biological models that recapitulate the complex structures and functions of human organs. Despite the rapid growth in the generation of organoids, in vitro assay tools are still limited to 2D forms. Thus, a comprehensive and continuous functional evaluation of the electrogenic organoids remains a challenge. Here, a highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented for functional evaluation of electrogenic organoids. The optimized serpentine structures with bridge structures cover the surface of the organoids conformally even in immersion. The protruding microelectrodes form a stable contact with the organoids and allow electrophysiological recordings with high signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR). sMEAs are fabricated in wafer‐scale for repeatable, scalable, and mass production and packed into an easy‐to‐use, user‐friendly, and robust microwell for fast dissemination of technology. The versatility of sMEA is validated by measuring electrophysiological signals from cardiac spheroids and midbrain organoids with a wide range of sizes from 500 to 1500 µm. Also, electrophysiological signals recorded with high SNR enable functional evaluation of the effects of drugs. The proposed sMEA with high SNR and user‐friendly interface could be the key player in high‐throughput drug screening, 3D spatiotemporal mapping of electrogenic organoids, and standardization of protocols for quality assessment.

<title>Noble‐Metal‐Free Cocatalysts Reinforcing Hole Consumption for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Ultrahigh Apparent Quantum Efficiency</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202412965?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, a novel strategy is proposed that reinforces hole consumption to boost the oxidation half‐reaction and ultimately the photocatalytic H2 production. This is achieved by the rational design of noble‐metal‐free cocatalysts as efficient oxidative sites, promoting the generation of sacrificial agents (CH3O−). Such a strategy can achieve a record apparent quantum efficiency of up to 65.8%.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and sustainable hydrogen production through photocatalysis is highly promising yet remains a significant challenge, especially when replacing costly noble metals with more abundant alternatives. Conversion efficiency with noble‐metal‐free alternatives is frequently limited by high charge recombination rates, mainly due to the sluggish transfer and inefficient consumption of photo‐generated holes. To address these challenges, a rational design of noble‐metal‐free cocatalysts as oxidative sites is reported to facilitate hole consumption, leading to markedly increased H2 yield rates without relying on expensive noble metals. By integrating femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, the rapid hole consumption is compellingly confirmed, which in turn promotes the effective separation and migration of photo‐generated carriers. The optimized catalyst delivers an impressive photocatalytic H2 yield rate of 57.84 mmol gcat−1 h−1, coupled with an ultrahigh apparent quantum efficiency reaching up to 65.8%. Additionally, a flow‐type quartz microreactor is assembled using the optimal catalyst thin film, which achieves a notable H2 yield efficiency of 0.102 mL min−1 and maintains high stability over 1260 min of continuous operation. The strategy of reinforcing hole consumption through noble‐metal‐free cocatalysts establishes a promising pathway for scalable and economically viable solar H2 production.

<title>Self‐Adaptive Zwitterionic Polysilazane Coatings with Mechanical Robustness, High Transparency, and Broad‐Spectrum Antiadhesion Properties</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel strategy for developing self‐adaptive zwitterionic polysilazane coatings with excellent mechanical robustness and broad‐spectrum antiadhesion properties is proposed. The developed coatings exhibits excellent wear resistance, good flexibility, strong adhesion, and high transparency as well as anti‐biofouling, anti‐liquid adhesion, and anti‐scaling properties. They have potential applications in marine industries, optical devices, pipeline transportation, and other fields.








Abstract
Antiadhesive coatings have been extensively studied owing to their wide applications in biology, environment, and energy. However, developing a mechanically robust coating with broad‐spectrum antiadhesion properties remains challenging. Herein, a novel strategy for preparing hard yet flexible and self‐adaptive zwitterionic polysilazane coatings with broad‐spectrum antiadhesion properties (anti‐biofouling, anti‐liquid adhesion, and anti‐scaling) is proposed. The coatings are prepared by combining polysilazane with a telomer (FT) consisting of a low‐surface‐energy fluorine motif and hydrolysis‐induced zwitterions. Before Si─OH generation in polysilazane, the fluorine motif drives the zwitterionic precursor to enrich on the surface, generating a zwitterionic layer following pre‐hydrolysis. This unique design prevents the coatings from swelling in water, allowing them to adapt to diverse environments. The fluorine motif can orient toward the surface of air, providing anti‐liquid adhesion capabilities, whereas the zwitterions orient underwater to endow anti‐biofouling, anti‐liquid adhesion, and anti‐scaling capabilities. The highly cross‐linked network toughened by FT contributes to the high hardness (up to 7H) and good flexibility of the coating. The chemical bonding between the coating and substrates ensures their strong adhesion (≈2.06–7.67 MPa). This study contributes to the design of mechanically robust broad‐spectrum antiadhesive coatings applicable in marine industries, optical devices, pipeline transportation, and other fields.

<title>Popularizing Holistic High‐Index Crystal Plane via Nonepitaxial Electrodeposition Toward Hydrogen‐Embrittlement‐Relieved Zn Anode</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Optimized electrodeposition dynamics help mitigate severe hydrodynamic fluctuations and hydrogen embrittlement issues, which not only refines the Zn deposition quality but also cultivates high‐index Zn (112) texture, rendering durable Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Electrodeposition is promising to fabricate Zn electrodes affording nonepitaxial single‐crystal textures. Previous research endeavors focus on achieving Zn(002) faceted deposition, nevertheless, the popularization of a high‐index Zn plane with favorable electrochemical activity remains poorly explored. There also exists a deficiency in the assessment of the electrodeposited quality of Zn. Here, a straightforward strategy to address such concerns by cultivating predominant Zn(112) texture via a potentiostatic electrodeposition mode is reported. By precisely identifying the “limiting” conditions for electrodeposition, a striking balance between improved deposition quality, tailored deposition kinetics, and suppressed hydrogen evolution is found. (002) Faceted Zn electrode is shown that be indeed produced, yet the rampant hydrodynamic convection and hydrogen embrittlement issue under such “over‐limiting” preparation conditions pose challenges in the electrode lifespan. In contrast, an optimized deposition minimizes hydrodynamic disturbances and mitigates the hydrogen embrittlement effect, where the thus‐generated high‐index (112)‐textured Zn electrode manifests impressive deposition quality and demonstrates holistic cycling stability. The pouch cell by pairing a ZnxV2O5 (ZnVO) cathode manages a reversible capacity of ≈130 mAh and a capacity retention of 98.42%. This study offers guidance for the development of dendrite‐free and hydrogen‐embrittlement‐relieved Zn anodes, unleashing the potential of high‐index plane textures for advanced Zn batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Precise and efficient treatment of orthotopic small‐size glioblastoma is realized in this work by fully taking advantage of two‐photon excitation and an aggregation‐induced emission photosensitizer. The proposed photosensitizer with a large two‐photon absorption cross‐section, the second near‐infrared excitation, the first near‐infrared emission, and prominent ROS generation, contributes to remarkable tumor growth inhibition and an ultra‐deep imaging depth in the brain.








Abstract
The existence of residual small‐size tumors after surgery is a major factor contributing to the high recurrence rate of glioblastoma (GBM). Conventional adjuvant therapeutics involving both chemotherapy and radiotherapy usually exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy and severe side effects. Recently, two‐photon photodynamic therapy (TP‐PDT), especially excited by the second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) light, offers an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge, attributed to its combinational merits of PDT and TP excitation. However, this attempt has not been explored yet. On the other hand, the lack of high‐performance photosensitizers (PSs) also hinders the progress of TP‐PDT on GBM. Based on those, a robust TP‐PS, termed MeTTh, is constructed intendedly through elaborately integrating multiple beneficial design strategies into a single molecule, which simultaneously achieves excellent NIR‐II excitation, large absorption cross‐section, aggregation‐induced NIR‐I emission, and prominent Type I/II reactive oxygen species generation. Aided by nanofabrication, an impressive brain structure imaging depth of 940 µm is realized. Moreover, MeTTh nanoparticles smoothly implement precise and efficient treatment of small‐size GBM in vivo under a 1040 nm femtosecond laser irradiation. This study represents first‐in‐class using TP‐PDT on GBM, offering new insights for the therapy of small‐size tumors in complex and vital tissues.

<title>Intrinsic Localized Excitons in MoSe2/CrSBr Heterostructure</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study indentifies localized excitons confined by substrate defects in the MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructure, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of intrinsic defects in modulating excitonic properties. Distinctive proximity‐induced behaviors, including opposite valley polarization evolutions of MoSe2 excitons and novel in‐plane anisotropic emissions, are reported. This work deepens the understanding of spectrally resolved proximity effects in magnetic van der Waals heterostructures.








Abstract
Despite extensive studies on magnetic proximity effects, the fundamental excitonic properties of the 2D semiconductor‐magnet heterostructures remain elusive. Here, the presence of localized excitons in MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructures is unveiled, represented by a new photoluminescence emission feature, X*. Our findings reveal that X* originates from excitons confined by intrinsic defects in the CrSBr layer. Additionally, the degrees of valley polarization of the X* and trion peaks exhibit opposite polarities under a magnetic field and closely correlate with the magnetic order of CrSBr. This is attributed to spin‐dependent charge transfer across the heterointerface, supported by density functional theory calculations which reveal a type‐II band alignment. Furthermore, the strong in‐plane anisotropy of CrSBr induces unique polarization‐dependent responses in MoSe2 emissions. This study highlights the crucial role of defects in shaping excitonic properties and offers valuable insights into spectrally resolved proximity effects in semiconductor‐magnet van der Waals heterostructures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thin film Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) on roll‐to‐roll gravure printing cylinders offers superior conductive ink transfer to flexible substrates compared to chrome. It enables fine lines and intricate structures for flexible electronics and security applications. DLC supports high‐volume production of flexible microelectronics and micro‐scale battery components, providing a more sustainable alternative to rigid electronics and reducing the carbon footprint.








Abstract
Diamond‐Like Carbon (DLC), a thin‐film material, is emerging as a promising alternative for durable surfaces due to its eco‐friendly application process. This study evaluated the use of thin‐film DLC on the wafer surface of gravure cylinders for roll‐to‐roll printing of fine‐line electrodes and microtext patterns, specifically for applications in flexible electronics and graphics security. Results suggested that using thin film DLC on the wafer surface allows reliable reproduction of isometric grids and line structures with widths of 15, 20, and 30 µm, as well as solid electrodes. The uniform conformity of thin‐film DLC on the wafer surface, featuring an engraved micron‐size cell structure, demonstrates superior ink transfer onto flexible PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrates. This results in increased electrode line width and reduced electrical resistance compared to chrome. Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability and repeatability of the findings. Visual analysis of lines and microtext also demonstrated the reliable print‐reproducing capabilities of DLC‐coated surfaces. Overall, these results suggest that thin‐film DLC is a promising alternative for use as a protective layer on gravure wafer surfaces. It has the potential to produce high‐quality, high‐volume electronics, such as sensors, antennas, and batteries, for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other sustainable technologies.

<title>Field‐Induced Polarization Rotation in Order–Disorder (K,Na)NbO3‐Based Ferroelectrics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A combination of advanced structural characterization at local and average scales and theoretical calculations reveals that the macroscopic rhombohedral‐tetragonal phase coexistence of (K,Na)NbO3‐based piezoceramics is essentially an average projection of collective local disordered units exhibiting the order‐disorder behavior. The field‐induced polarization rotation with a change in the degree of ordering is found to play a key role in boosting the functional properties of the investigated ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Phase boundary is highly recognized for its capability in engineering various physical properties of ferroelectrics. Here, field‐induced polarization rotation is reported in a high‐performance (K, Na)NbO3‐based ferroelectric system at the rhombohedral‐tetragonal phase boundary. First, the lattice structure is examined from both macroscopic and local scales, implementing Rietveld refinement and pair distribution function analysis, respectively. The macroscopic phase coexistence at the phase boundary can be interchangeably rationalized with an average projection of collective local disordered units, exhibiting the order–disorder nature. The structural evidence of field‐induced polarization rotation is provided by the in situ synchrotron study. Theoretical studies including density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation also predict the polarization rotation mechanism. The simulation result reveals the variation of the degree of ordering during the polarization rotation as a key feature of the boosted electrical properties in the order–disorder ferroelectric system. The discovery provides meaningful insight into the design of ferroelectrics with enhanced physical properties.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By utilizing anthracene and metalloporphyrin as the active components for the activation of oxygen and the catalysis of intramolecular cross‐oxidation coupling reaction, respectively, a series of photosensitive and stable tandem heterogeneous COF catalysts are constructed for realizing the efficient photosynthesis of 4‐quinazolinones. Particularly, TAPP‐Cu‐An enables one‐step, gram‐scale photosynthesis of 4‐quinazolinones in a short time and under mild conditions.








Abstract
The dehydrogenative cross‐coupling reaction is the premier route for synthesizing important 4‐quinazolinone drugs. However, it usually requires high reaction temperature and long reaction time, and the yield of the final product is low. Here two stable and photosensitive covalent‐organic frameworks (COFs), TAPP‐An and TAPP‐Cu‐An are purposefully designed and constructed to serve as unprecedented heterogeneous tandem catalysts to complete dehydrogenative cross‐coupling reactions in a short time and under mild reaction conditions (room temperature and light), leading to the high‐efficient photosynthesis of 4‐quinazolinones. Particularly, TAPP‐Cu‐An is the best heterogeneous catalyst currently available for the synthesis of 4‐quinazolinones, even surpassing all the catalysts reported so far. It also enables one‐step photosynthesis of 4‐quinazolinones with higher conversion (>99%) and selectivity (>99%) in a shorter time, and the product can be easily prepared on a gram scale. Extensive experiments combined with theoretical calculations show that the excellent photogenerated charge separation and transport capability, as well as the synergistic An‐Cu catalysis in TAPP‐Cu‐An are the main driving forces for this efficient reaction.

<title>Coordination Regulation Enabling Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Fast‐Charging High‐Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A sulfonate‐based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) composed of prop‐1‐ene‐1,3‐sultone (PES) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) without additional additives is developed. The unique Li+−PES−TFSI− coordination structure in the DEE facilitates rapid ion transport. Meanwhile, the strengthened α−H···F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thereby enabling the cycle stability of high‐capacity and high‐voltage cathode materials in lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The safety and cycle stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) under conditions of high cut‐off voltage and fast charging put forward higher requirements for electrolytes. Here, a sulfonate‐based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) resulting from the eutectic effect between solid sultone and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide without any other additives is reported. The intermolecular coordination effect triggers this eutectic phenomenon, as evidenced with nuclear magnetic resonance, and thus the electrochemical behavior of the DEE can be controlled by jointly regulating the coordination effects of F···H and Li···O intermolecular interactions. The DEE with a properly coordinated environment of Li+ presents a low motion barrier and a high transport rate of localized Li+, leading to a 10 C fast‐charging LiFePO4||Li battery with a capacity retention of 95.1% after 500 cycles. Meanwhile, the strengthened α−H···F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thus enabling the cycle stability of high‐capacity and high‐voltage cathode materials in LMBs, e.g., a cycle stability at 4.5 V in the LiNi0.88Co0.07Mn0.05O2||Li battery with a capacity retention of 81.0% after 500 cycles, and an excellent compatibility in 4.5 V LiCoO2||Li and 4.8 V Li1.13Mn0.517Ni0.256Co0.097O2||Li batteries. The practical applicability of the carefully designed DEE is underscored through successful implementation in pouch cells.

<title>Introducing La into a Customized Dual Cu Covalent Organic Framework to Steer CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity from C2H4 to CH4</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Customized multi‐metal sites within covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a versatile platform for optimizing catalytic performance by precisely tuning metal composition based on their inherent properties. Specifically, the incorporation of oxophilic rare‐earth La into the dual Cu COF steers CO2 electroreduction selectivity from C2H4 to CH4, which realizes the directional regulation of catalytic products.








Abstract
Customizing multi‐metal site catalysts for achieving controllable CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) product tuning holds immense promise yet poses formidable challenges. The traditional synthesis method of multi‐metal sites is the pyrolysis of metal‐containing precursors, which is inherently uncontrollable. Herein, a bottom‐up strategy is employed to customize and synthesize multi‐metal sites in covalent organic frameworks (COFs), aiming to controllably switch the CO2 reduction selectivity by regulating the electronic structure of active sites. Briefly, La element provides chances for manipulating and finetuning the electronic structure of the customized dual Cu sites, and converts the main catalytic product of CO2RR from ethylene to methane. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of La alters the electronic structure around Cu, enhances CO2 and H2O activation, and changes the formation of energy barriers of key intermediates. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study constructed the first example of customized multi‐metal site COF catalysts and provided new ideas for controllable modulation of products.

The repaired LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 by direct recycling technology shows an unsatisfactory cycle life. Local lattice stress is introduced into the regenerated cathode during repair. The resulting stress gradient leads to the localization of the phonon mode and changes the phonon dispersion relation of materials, inhibits TM atoms migration and the formation of defect structures. The regenerated cathode exhibits good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Direct recycling technology can effectively solve the environmental pollution and resource waste problems caused by spent lithium‐ion batteries. However, the repaired LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) black mass by direct recycling technology shows an unsatisfactory cycle life, which is attributed to the formation of spinel/rock salt phases and rotational stacking faults caused by the in‐plane and out‐of‐plane migration of transition metal (TM) atoms during charge/discharge. Herein, local lattice stress is introduced into the regenerated cathode during repair. The resulting stress gradient leads to the localization of the phonon mode and changes the phonon dispersion relation of materials, lowers the bending and stretching vibration frequencies of the TM─O covalent bond in cathode materials, and inhibits the TM atoms migration and the formation of defect structures. Beneficial from the favorable low‐frequency phonon dispersion relation, the regenerated NCM represents remarkably enhanced structural stability during cycling, and exhibits good electrochemical performance. This reconstructed phonon dispersion relation approach broadens the perspective for lattice stress field engineering to suppress the defective structure raised from TM migration and paves the way for the development of regenerated cathodes with long durability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A highly modulated interlayer spacing is observed for the first time in the epitaxial 2D spirals with electron correlations. Scalable synthesis of the epitaxial TaS2 spirals is achieved with customized CVD reactions. An intertwined CDW‐Mott state appears at room‐temperature in the epitaxial 1T‐TaS2 spirals, offering a platform to study collective properties at high temperatures.








Abstract

Tantalum disulfide (1T‐TaS2), being a Mott insulator with strong electron correlation, is highlighted for diverse collective quantum states in the 2D lattice, including charge density wave (CDW), spin liquid, and unconventional superconductivity. The Mott physics embedded in the 2D triangular CDW lattice has raised debates on stacking‐dependent properties because interlayer interactions are sensitive to van der Waals (vdW) spacing. However, control of interlayer distance remains a challenge. Here, spiral lattices in the epitaxial TaS2 spirals are studied to probe collective properties with tunable interlayer interactions. A scalable synthesis of epitaxial TaS2 spirals is presented. A more than 50%‐increased interlayer spacing enables prototype decoupled monolayers for enhanced electronic correlation exhibiting Mott physics at room‐temperature and a simplified system to explore collective properties in vdW materials.

A homo‐spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is reported that expanded to realize multisignal no‐spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission (4 times) via 3D vertical integration of four sensors. Moreover, HMPTs is used for the acquisition of 3D material information and the complete reconstruction of material information in VR.








Abstract
The spatiotemporal error caused by planar tiled structure design and the waste of communication resources brought on by the transmission of a single channel are two challenges facing the development of multifunctional intelligent sensors with high‐density integration. A homo‐spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is expanded to realize multisignal no‐spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission. First, this system optimizes the distribution of multifunctional sensors, completes the 3D vertical heterogeneous layout of four sensors, and achieves material multi‐information detection at a single place with no‐spatiotemporal deviation. Additionally, the system couples and transmittes multiple sensory signals, delivering a fourfold increase in transmission efficiency and one‐third of the power consumption compared to a single‐channel transmission system. Finally, this system is used for the recognition of mixed materials, and human‐computer interaction to realize the assignment of materials in VR, demonstrating the great accuracy and transmission efficiency of HMPTs as well as its feasibility in practical application. This is an a priori effort to enhance machine perception accuracy, improve signal transmission effectiveness, and advance human‐machine‐object triadic integration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel hydrogel bioadhesive taking the structural advantage of phenylalanine derivative for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions is reported. The hydrogel adhesive can not only realize fast hemostasis and accelerated tissue/organ injuries healing in vivo but also can be assembled as bioelectronics for precise and long‐term health monitoring under humid environments.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives with adequate wet adhesion and swelling resistance are urgently needed in clinic. However, the presence of blood or body fluid usually weakens the interfacial bonding strength, and even leads to adhesion failure. Herein, profiting from the unique coupling structure of carboxylic and phenyl groups in one component (N‐acryloyl phenylalanine) for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions, a novel hydrogel adhesive (PAAS) is developed with superior tissue adhesion properties and matrix swelling resistance in challenging wet conditions (adhesion strength of 85 kPa, interfacial toughness of 450 J m−2, burst pressure of 514 mmHg, and swelling ratio of <4%). The PAAS hydrogel can not only realize fast hemostasis of liver, heart, artery rupture, and sealing of pulmonary air‐leakage but also accelerate the recovery of stomach and liver defects in rat, rabbit, and pig models. Moreover, PAAS hydrogel can precisely and durably monitor various physiological activities (pulse, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram) even under humid environments (immersion in water for 3 days), and can be employed for the evaluation of in vivo sealing efficiency for artery rupture. The work provides a promising hydrogel adhesive for clinical hemostasis, tissue injury repair, and bioelectronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a novel synthetic approach to multicomponent MOFs by “standing on the shoulder of” a well‐established one based on the new understanding on the self‐assembly process. By making use of various chemical interactions during the self‐assembly process, the structural transformation can be modulated from ternary 3D structures to quaternary 2D structures.








Abstract
Multicomponent MOFs have offered a wide range of opportunities to harness new properties. However, the synthesis of multicomponent MOFs remains challenging. This work demonstrates the synthesis of a family of multicomponent MOFs by topological transformation from well‐established multicomponent partitioned acs (pacs) structures. Such transformation is based on the new understanding on the self‐assembly process of pacs MOFs. A key to this understanding is that pacs structures, topologically regarded as the introduction of a pore‐partitioning ligand into MOF‐235/MIL‐88 type framework, are likely to be formed in a layer‐pillar‐layer fashion in practical reactions. As the π–π interaction between layers and other chemical interactions during the self‐assembly process are recognized, the structural transformation can be modulated from 3D pacs structures to 2D interrupted pacs structures (denoted i‐pacs). It is especially noteworthy that such dimensional reduction is first observed in metal‐organic frameworks and the i‐pacs MOFs contain four structural modules and up to five components, which have the highest complexity among 2D MOFs. Interestingly, the i‐pacs MOFs have significantly enhanced performance for CO2/N2 separation in comparison with pacs MOFs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The reversibility and activity of anionic redox reactions in lithium‐rich manganese‐based oxides (LRMOs) for all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) are significantly enhanced by the simultaneous incorporation of high‐binding energy B─O bonds and high‐efficiency LBO ionic networks into LRMO. This results in the formation of a robust LRMO‐LBO interwoven structure, which stabilizes the layered structure and LRMO|solid electrolyte interface, thereby contributing to superior long‐term cycling stability in ASSBs.








Abstract
The use of lithium‐rich manganese‐based oxides (LRMOs) as the cathode in all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) holds great potential for realizing high energy density over 600 Wh kg−1. However, their implementation is significantly hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior reversibility of anionic redox reactions of oxygen in ASSBs. In this contribution, boron ions (B3+) doping and 3D Li2B4O7 (LBO) ionic networks construction are synchronously introduced into LRMO materials (LBO‐LRMO) by mechanochemical and subsequent thermally driven diffusion method. Owing to the high binding energy of B─O and high‐efficiency ionic networks of nanoscale LBO complex in cathode materials, the as‐prepared LBO‐LRMO displays highly reversible and activated anionic redox reactions in ASSBs. The designed LBO‐LRMO interwoven structure enables robust phase and LBO‐LRMO|solid electrolyte interface stability during cycling (over 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1.0 C with a voltage range of 2.2–4.7 V vs Li/Li+). This contribution affords a fundamental understanding of the anionic redox reactions for LRMO in ASSBs and offers an effective strategy to realize highly activated and reversible oxygen redox reactions in LRMO‐based ASSBs.

A novel phototransistor is introduced by leveraging the unique optoelectronic properties of two low‐dimensional materials. The architecture enhances image perception and restoration quality, providing a robust solution for complex scenarios in machine vision. This innovative method facilitates the precise restoration of damaged images, offering significant potential for future advancements in sensor computing.








Abstract
Traditional imaging systems struggle in weak or complex lighting environments due to their fixed spectral responses, resulting in spectral mismatches and degraded image quality. To address these challenges, a bioinspired adaptive broadband image sensor is developed. This innovative sensor leverages a meticulously designed type‐I heterojunction alignment of 0D perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) and 2D black phosphorus (BP). This configuration enables efficient carrier injection control and advanced computing capabilities within an integrated phototransistor array. The sensor's unique responses to both visible and infrared (IR) light facilitate selective enhancement and precise feature extraction under varying lighting conditions. Furthermore, it supports real‐time convolution and image restoration within a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) network, effectively countering image degradation by capturing spectral features. Remarkably, the hardware responsivity weights perform comparably to software‐trained weights, achieving an image restoration accuracy of over 85%. This approach offers a robust and versatile solution for machine vision applications that demand precise and adaptive imaging in dynamic lighting environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large‐scale polar flux‐closure array from typical c/a domains are observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 bilayers, which is reversible after the removal of external electric fields. Phase‐field simulations demonstrate that the decrease of electrostatic energy is a main driving force in the transition of a/c to flux‐closures.








Abstract
Polar topologies show great potentials in memories and other nano‐micro devices. To integrate with silicon conducting circuits, it is vital to understand the dynamic evolution and the transformation of different domain configurations under external stimulus. Here in situ transmission electron microscopy is performed and the electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large‐scale polar flux‐closure array from typical c/a domains in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 bilayers is directly observed. It is found that the transformation is reversible after removal of external electric fields. Increasing external electric fields on (PbTiO3/SrTiO3)5 multilayered films, it is further found that the flux‐closure domains are nucleated and propagated via the steps of first the formation of new c domains and then connection with neighboring c domains. The transition from a/c domains to flux‐closure arrays under electric fields is collaborated with evaluating energy variations by phase‐field simulations in which the electrostatic energy plays an important role. These results demonstrate the polar topologies can be reversibly manipulated by external stimuli, which sheds light on further understanding the dynamics behavior of polar topologies and helps for future nanoelectric applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study explores how the deformation behavior of intermetallics can be linked through their crystal's building blocks. By examining samarium‐cobalt phases, it is found that their plasticity is not directly inherited from building blocks but is influenced by local bonding environments. These insights highlight the role of local bonding in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally complex intermetallics.








Abstract
Intermetallics, which encompass a wide range of compounds, often exhibit similar or closely related crystal structures, resulting in various intermetallic systems with structurally derivative phases. This study examines the hypothesis that deformation behavior can be transferred from fundamental building blocks to structurally related phases using the binary samarium‐cobalt system. SmCo2 and SmCo5 are investigated as fundamental building blocks and compared them to the structurally related SmCo3 and Sm2Co17 phases. Nanoindentation and micropillar compression tests are performed to characterize the primary slip systems, complemented by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations via atomic‐scale modeling. The results show that while elastic properties of the structurally complex phases follow a rule of mixtures, their plastic deformation mechanisms are more intricate, influenced by the stacking and bonding nature within the crystal's building blocks. These findings underscore the importance of local bonding environments in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally related intermetallics, providing crucial insights for the development of high‐performance intermetallic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This research provides a significant breakthrough in the field of narrowband organic photodiodes (OPDs) by introducing a novel class of boron‐nitrogen (BN) single‐component wavelength‐selective materials. The OPDs incorporating these single‐component BN photoabsorbers demonstrate record‐high external quantum efficiency of 33.77% and small full‐width half‐maximum of 36 nm in the reported narrowband OPDs using single‐component photoabsorbers.








Abstract
Organic photodiodes (OPDs) that utilize wavelength‐selective absorbing molecules offer a direct approach to capturing specific wavelengths of light in multispectral sensors/imaging systems without filters. However, they exhibit broad response bandwidths, low external quantum efficiency (EQE), and often require compromises in two‐component photoactive materials. Herein, the first utility of boron‐nitrogen (BN) single‐component photoabsorbers, leveraging a multi‐resonance effect are introduced to attain OPDs with both record‐high EQE of 33.77% and ultra‐small full‐width half‐maximum (FWHM) of 36 nm in the reported narrowband OPDs using single‐component photoabsorbers. It is found that the outstanding performance of these narrowband OPDs can be attributed to the ultra‐small FWHM, slow charge recombination, low activation energy, and balanced bipolar charge transport within the para‐tert‐butyl substituted B,N‐embedded rigid polycyclic molecule (BNCz) film. Furthermore, BN derivatives such as BN(p)SCH3, BN(p)SO2CH3, and pyBN‐m‐H have also shown high EQE, minimal FWHM, and tunable photoresponse peaks ranging from blue‐violet to blue‐turquoise, highlighting the potential of BN molecules and molecular engineering in the development of novel narrowband absorbers for advanced wavelength‐selective OPDs. Such pioneering working can provide a class of novel narrowband absorbers to propel the advancement of high‐performance wavelength‐selective OPDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dual strategy for the design of covalent organic frameworks integrates molecular rigidity–flexibility regulation with hard–soft atom incorporation. The synthesized DAPhen‐COF achieves over 95% removal of Np(V), Pu(IV), and Am(III), with a separation factor exceeding 5000 for Np/Gd. This study marks the first application of covalent organic frameworks in separating various transuraniums from lanthanides.








Abstract
Separating actinides from lanthanides is essential for managing nuclear waste and promoting sustainable nuclear energy development. The recycling of transuranium elements (TRUs: Np, Pu, Am) is also significant for various nuclear technology applications. In this study, a dual strategy is introduced to designing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that skillfully combines molecular rigidity with flexibility, integrating both hard and soft donor atoms in the synthesis of monomers. This results in a specialized COF that efficiently and selectively captures TRUs from acidic aqueous solutions. By utilizing the topological arrangement of rigid ligands to influence the twisting and stretching of flexible ligands, coordination environment featuring nitrogen and oxygen is created, which enhances the separation of transuranium in various oxidation states over lanthanides. In 0.5 m HNO3 solution, the as‐synthesized DAPhen‐COF achieves removal rates of 99.1% for Np(V) and 95.8% for Pu(IV). For Am(III), the removal rate reaches 98.6% in 0.01 m HNO3. DAPhen‐COF exhibits remarkable selectivity for Np(V), with a separation factor of over 5000 for Np/Gd, outperforming other solid‐phase materials. This research provides a comprehensive investigation into the design and synthesis of COFs for actinide capture, marking the first application of COFs in the separation of various TRUs over lanthanides.

An ionogel comprised of mobile ions and piezoelectric polymer matrices is characteristic of both piezoelectric and ionic thermoelectric attributes. The gel is capable of capturing heat, stress, and moisture from the environment and converting them into remarkably high voltage outputs, enabling acute sensing in clinic scenarios.








Abstract
A paradigm ionogel consisting of ionic liquid (IL) and PVDF−HFP composites is made, which inherently possesses dual‐function ionic thermoelectric (iTE) and piezoelectric (PE) attributes. This study investigates an innovative “PE‐enhanced iTEs” effect, wherein the ionic thermopower exhibits a 58% enhancement while the ionic conductivity arises more than 2× within a PE‐induced internal electric field. By harnessing these multifaceted features, fully self‐powered, multimodal sensors demonstrate their superior energy conversion capabilities, which possessed minimum sensitivities of 0.13 mV kPa−1 and 0.96 mV K−1 in pressure and temperature alterations, respectively. The PE augmentation of iTEs is maximized by ≈3× under rising water pressure. Their swift and sophisticated responses to various in vivo vital signs simultaneously in a hemorrhagic shock scenario, indicative of good prospects in the clinical medicine field are showcased.

<title>Fully Transparent and Distortion‐Free Monotonically Stretchable Substrate by Nanostructure Alignment</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414794?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414794?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
For achieving monotonic transparent, stretchable substrates with near‐zero Poisson's ratio, this approach utilizes nanoscopic block copolymer alignment via shear‐rolling. This alignment of nanostructures smaller than the wavelength of light yields a near‐zero Poisson's ratio (≈0.07), eliminating vertical contraction and maintaining distortion‐free performance under uniform strain across the entire area even under 50% strain, with excellent optical properties.








Abstract
Stretchable devices, garnering increasing attention as next‐generation form factors, have a crucial problem in that vertical contraction occurs during stretching, causing image distortion of stretchable displays and discomfort in skin‐attached devices. Previous structural strategies to mitigate vertical contraction, such as auxetic reentrants and wrinkles, suffer from the drawback that their structure becomes visible during stretching. In this study, this issue is addressed by unidirectionally aligning nanoscopic cylinders within block copolymer elastomer films. Employing a shear‐rolling process at high temperatures on thick films of polystyrene‐block‐polyisobutylene‐block‐polystyrene thermoplastic elastomers, macroscopic mechanical anisotropy is achieved, resulting in completely transparent and monotonically stretchable substrates devoid of vertical or depth distortion during deformation. Significantly, the unidirectional orientation of high‐modulus cylindrical nanostructures induces macroscopic mechanical anisotropy with a modulus ratio exceeding five times. While the Poisson's ratio of conventional elastic materials hovers around ≈0.5, this mechanical anisotropy minimizes vertical contraction, yielding a Poisson's ratio below 0.07. Moreover, owing to the negligible size of the nanocylinders compared to visible‐light wavelengths, the substrate can be monotonically uniaxially stretched while maintaining high transmittance without introducing distortions, surface undulations, or haziness, resulting in distortion‐free stretchable substrates.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study develops TP/ZIS‐10 S‐scheme heterostructures, uncovers unique charge transfer dynamics via TR EPR, ISIXPS, and fs‐TA spectroscopy, and provides novel insights into charge carrier dynamics at S‐scheme heterojunction interfaces, paving the way for efficient and stable organic–inorganic S‐scheme photocatalysts for green energy conversion.








Abstract
Understanding charge carrier transfer at heterojunction interfaces is critical for advancing solar energy conversion technologies. This study utilizes continuous wave (CW), pulse, and time‐resolved (TR) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to explore the radical species formed at the TAPA (tris(4−aminophenyl)amine)‐PDA (Terephthaldicarboxaldehyde)/ZnIn2S4 (TP/ZIS) heterojunction interface. CW and pulse EPR identify stable radical defects localized near the interface, accessible to water molecules. Time‐resolved EPR reveals a photoinduced electron transfer from TP to ZIS, leading to the generation of spin‐correlated radical pairs under light irradiation, signifying efficient charge carrier separation and spatial transfer within the S‐scheme heterojunction. This electron transfer mechanism, confirmed through in situ X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, suppresses undesirable carrier recombination, extending charge carrier lifetimes. These findings provide novel insights into the transport direction of charge carriers at the S‐scheme heterojunction interface, offering valuable guidance for designing highly efficient and stable organic–inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts for solar energy applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents a plasmonic photocatalyst with an ordered Au nanoparticle array on SrTiO3, enhancing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining constant resonant energy due to surface lattice resonance. This balance improves charge separation and increases local charge density at active sites, boosting water oxidation activity sevenfold. These results demonstrate a promising strategy for optimizing SPR characteristics to enhance photocatalytic performance on plasmonic platforms, opening avenues for more efficient energy conversion applications.








Abstract
Plasmonic resonance intensity in metallic nanostructures plays a crucial role in charge generation and separation, directly affecting plasmon‐induced photocatalytic activity. Engineering strategies to enhance plasmonic effects involve designing specific nanostructures, such as triangular nanoplates with sharp corners or dimer nanostructures with hot spots. However, these approaches often lead to a trade‐off between enhanced plasmonic intensity and resonance energy, which ultimately determines local charge density and photocatalytic performance. Here, inspired by theoretical predications, it is shown that a flexibly controlled plasmonic photocatalyst, consisting of an ordered array of Au nanoparticles on a SrTiO3 surface, exhibits an enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining a constant SPR resonant energy, due to the presence of surface lattice resonance. This trade‐off results in improved charge separation efficiency and an increase in local charge density at catalytically active sites, as verified by theoretical simulations, surface photovoltage microscopy, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, the optimized periodic photocatalyst shows a 7‐fold increase in water oxidation activity over disordered nanostructures. This work provides a novel approach for balancing the intensity and energy of SPR, which will contribute to optimizing photocatalytic activity on plasmonic platforms.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dynamic liquid metal–microfiber interlocking interface is proposed to develop a highly stable and conductive metastructured fiber, which shows remarkable conductivity of 1.5 × 106 S m−1, and maintains stable conductance with only a 16% relative resistance change at 100% strain. These fibers are demonstrated as versatile platforms for wearable temperature‐visualizing electrothermal heaters and fully stretchable smart sensing‐display fabrics.








Abstract
Stretchable fibers with high conductivity are vital components for smart textiles and wearable electronics. However, embedding solid conductive materials in polymers significantly reduces conductive pathways when stretched, causing a sharp drop in conductivity. Here, a stretchable metastructured fiber with dynamic liquid metal–microfiber interlocking interface is reported to realize highly conductive yet ultrastable conductance. The Cu‐EGaIn mixture is partially embedded within the porous microfiber mat, thereby enabling its roll‐up into a spiral‐layered metastructured fiber with self‐compensating conductive pathways. The metastructured fiber shows outstanding performance, including high conductivity of 1.5 × 106 S m−1, large stretchability up to 629%, and ultrastable conductance with only 16% relative resistance change at 100% strain, which far surpasses the theoretical value. Moreover, these fibers have served as versatile platforms for wearable temperature‐visualizing electrothermal fiber heaters and fully stretchable smart sensing‐display fabrics. This dynamic solid–liquid interfacial interlocking strategy is promising for stretchable electronics.

A Pd‐Sn intermetallic compound with Pd deficiency (Pd1.9−xSn, x = 0.06), enhanced by Sn incorporation from SnOx, demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation. The efficient dissociation of the C–C bond highlights its potential for energy conversion applications.








Abstract
A common challenge in electrochemical processes is developing high performance, stable catalysts for specific chemical reactions. In this work, a Pd‐Sn intermetallic compound with   Pd site deficiency (Pd1.9−xSn) (x = 0.06) and trace amount of SnOx was synthesised by controlled process. Under the electrochemical conditions, the deficient Pd site is filled by metallic Sn, which generates a highly active and stable (Pd1.84Sn0.06)Sn catalyst for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The crystal structure and atomic arrangements for synthesized and in situ generated compound are comprehensively characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. The in situ generated catalyst exhibits excellent performance toward EOR (anodic reaction in fuel cell), which outperforms the state‐of‐the‐art Pd/C catalyst by three times in terms of activity. Furthermore, it is observed that the catalyst preferentially cleaves the CC bond in ethanol, which is a crucial process that enhances the efficiency of the fuel cells. The catalyst retains its superlative activity even after 1500 cycles of continuous operation. The mechanism for EOR and CC bond cleavage is evidenced by operando Infra Red spectroscopy and Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy (DEMS), and the driving force toward excellent performance has been proposed via theoretical calculations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work develops a one‐step strategy to fabricate bi‐continuous phase hydrogels under mild conditions. The resulting hydrogel exhibits excellent conductivity, elasticity, strain insensitivity, and biocompatibility. The hydrogel‐based electrode facilitates motion‐artifact‐free electrophysiological signal monitoring and enables wireless, multimodal data acquisition under dynamic conditions. This cutting‐edge technology offers potent tools for healthcare and medical management.








Abstract
Conducting polymer hydrogels have gained attention in the bioelectronics field due to their unique combination of biocompatibility and customizable mechanical properties. However, achieving both excellent conductivity and mechanical strength in a hydrogel remains a significant challenge, primarily because of the inherent conflict between the hydrophobic nature of conducting polymers and the hydrophilic characteristics of hydrogels. To address this issue, this work proposes a simple one‐step acid‐induced approach that not only promotes the gelation of hydrophilic polymers but also facilitates the in situ phase separation of hydrophobic conducting polymers under mild conditions. This results in a distinctive bi‐continuous phase structure with exceptional electrical property (906 mS cm−1) and mechanical performance (fracture strain of 1103%). The hydrogel forms robust percolating networks that maintain structural integrity under mechanical stress due to their entropic elasticity, providing remarkable strain insensitivity, low mechanical hysteresis, and an impressive resilience (95%). Electrodes fabricated from the conductive hydrogel exhibit stable and minimal interfacial contact impedance with skin (1–6 kilohms at 1–100 Hz) and significantly lower noise power (4.9 µV2). This work believes that the motion‐insensitive characteristics and mechanical robustness of this hydrogel will enable efficient and reliable monitoring of biological signals, establishing a new benchmark in the bioelectronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The efficient energy transfer of rolling spheres based on the basic law of physics forms the basis of a novel strategy, wherein the 3 interface π‐π stacking interactions induce the “rolling behavior” of microspheres. This approach mitigates local stress concentrations in composite epoxy resins, resulting in a synergistic enhancement of strength and toughness.








Abstract
The intrinsic compromise between strength and toughness in composite epoxy resins significantly constrains their practical applications. In this study, a novel strategy is introduced, leveraging interfacial π‐π stacking interactions to induce the “rolling behavior” of microsphere fillers, thereby facilitating efficient energy dissipation. This approach is corroborated through theoretical simulations and experimental validation. The resulting composite epoxy resin demonstrates an impressive 49.8% enhancement in strength and a remarkable 358.9% improvement in toughness compared to conventional epoxy resins, accompanied by substantially reduced hysteresis. Moreover, this system achieves reversible closed‐loop recyclability and rapid repair capabilities. The preliminary demonstration of “force‐temperature equivalence” further establishes a novel pathway for the design of high‐performance composite epoxy materials.

A simple design is illustrated for achieving prolonged and damped chemomechanical oscillations using a stimuli‐responsive membrane‐bound microgel within a stratified environment containing partitioned swelling and deswelling stimuli. The swelling and deswelling responses of the microgel in the bottom and top layers are coupled to buoyant motility via membrane‐mediated displacement of the external media.








Abstract
The design of chemomechanical self‐oscillators, which execute oscillations in the presence of constant stimuli lacking periodicity, is a step toward the development of autonomous and interactive soft robotic systems. This work presents a simple design of prolonged chemomechanical oscillatory movement in a microgel system capable of buoyant motility within stratified chemical media containing spatially localized sinking and floating stimuli. Three design elements are developed: a stimuli‐responsive membranized calcium alginate microgel, a Percoll density gradient for providing stratified antagonistic chemical media, and transduction of microgel particle size actuation into buoyant motility via membrane‐mediated displacement of the Percoll media. The presence of citrate or calcium ions in different layers of the Percoll media gives rise to swelling (buoyancy) or contraction (geotaxis), respectively, which in turn mediate the shuttling of the microgels between the layers to produce prolonged or damped chemomechanical oscillatory trajectories. The concentration‐dependence of the oscillatory behavior in the stratified media, the density gap between the Percoll layers, and the kinetic asymmetry of microgel swelling and deswelling are studied. The illustrated modular design allows for the development of chemomechanical self‐oscillators responsive to light, pH, or temperature, which will find applications in interactive soft robotics, autonomous microbots, and intelligent materials.

The stacked structure design method of integrating inorganic fillers with high ɛr, and PEI polymers with high breakdown strength is proposed. BNKT‐BST dense ceramics are prepared by solid‐phase reaction method, and BNKT‐BST/PEI nanocomposites are prepared by casting and hot‐pressing method, which resulted in nanocomposites with excellent energy storage properties at high temperatures.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are crucial for electronic communications and industrial applications due to their high breakdown field strength (Eb), fast charge/discharge speed, and temperature stability. The upcoming electronic‐electrical systems pose a significant challenge, necessitating polymeric dielectrics to exhibit exceptional thermal stability and energy storage capabilities at high temperatures. Here, ultra‐high dielectric constant (ɛr) and charge/discharge efficiency (η) of 0.55Bi0.5(Na0.84K0.16)0.5TiO3‐0.45(Bi0.1Sr0.85)TiO3 (BNKT‐BST) ceramics are prepared by the solid‐phase reaction method and added to polyetherimide (PEI) to form BNKT‐BST/PEI nanocomposites with various structures. The findings indicate that the sandwich‐structured BNKT‐BST/PEI nanocomposite achieves the highest discharged energy density (Ud) of 7.7 J cm−3 with η of 80.2% when the Eb is 650 MV m−1 at 150 °C. This is primarily due to the incorporation of BNKT‐BST nanoparticles and the multilayer structure design, which significantly improves the composite's ɛr and Eb. Additionally, the sandwich‐structured composites show excellent cycling stability at 500 MV m−1 and 150 °C, with Ud of ≈ 4.7 J cm−3 and η greater than 90%. The research presents nanocomposites with high energy storage density and excellent stability, crucial for the practical application of polymer dielectrics in high‐temperature environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A robust method is presented for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by incorporating a supporting layer of inverse opal photonic structures. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical modulation of afterglow in polymeric phosphors and position the resulting Janus film for potential applications in biosensing and information storage.








Abstract
Tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors is critical for advancing their use in optical data storage and display technologies. Despite advancements in polymer matrix design and dopant engineering, achieving dynamic control over afterglow intensity remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel approach is introduced for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by integrating them into an inverse opal photonic structure. By precisely aligning the photonic stopband of the inverse opal structure with the afterglow band of the polymer film, a remarkable 15‐fold enhancement in afterglow intensity is achieved. This enhancement is tunable, decreasing from 15 to 1.2 by infiltrating the photonic structure with media of varying refractive indices ranging from 1.00 (air) to 1.37 (ethyl acetate). The tunability arises from reducing the mismatch between the stopband and the afterglow band, as the weighted refractive index shifts between 1.15 and 1.40. Additionally, the inverse opal photonic structure induces angle‐dependent structural colors in the Janus polymeric phosphors, modulated by the refractive index of the infiltrating media. This integration of dynamically tunable afterglow with angle‐dependent structural coloration unlocks new potential for advanced optoelectronic applications.

Sterical aryl immobilizing groups are incorporated (phenyl and pyridine) at the C8 site of the rigid fluorene spacer. These immobilizing groups restrict both rotational and rocking motions. The completely confined conformation demonstrates enhanced TADF performance.








Abstract
Intramolecular through‐space charge‐transfer (TSCT) excited states have emerged as promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. This study addresses the challenges in tuning excited state dynamics through conformational engineering, which significantly impacts exciton utilization. An effective strategy is presented to enhance the performance of TSCT‐TADF molecules by restricting the lateral rocking of the spiro unit via immobilizing groups, which indirectly adjusts the conformations of the donor and acceptor subunits. This approach is successfully illustrated with two TSCT‐TADF emitters, 8PhDM‐B and 8PyDM‐B, featuring sterical aryl phenyl and pyridine substitutions at the C8 site of a rigid spiro‐fluorene bridge. Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) utilizing these emitters demonstrated impressive maximum external quantum efficiencies of 33.1% and 31.0%, respectively. The findings underscore the importance of the rocking confined strategy in refining excited state dynamics, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of highly efficient OLED emitters.

However, current analysis methods are limited to either bulk or low‐throughput single‐cell analysis, thus masking the heterogeneity in matrix deposition. Extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) combines the high‐throughput single‐cell analysis of flow cytometry with engineered microniche 3D cell culture, jointly enabling in situ matrix analysis of large cell populations.








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) guides cell behavior and tissue fate. Cell populations are notoriously heterogeneous leading to large variations in cell behavior at the single‐cell level. Although insights into population heterogeneity are valuable for fundamental biology, regenerative medicine, and drug testing, current ECM analysis techniques only provide either averaged population‐level data or single‐cell data from a limited number of cells. Here, extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) is presented as a novel platform technology that enables high‐throughput measurements of local nascent protein deposition at single‐cell level. Specifically, human primary chondrocytes are microfluidically encapsulated in enzymatically crosslinked microgels of 16 picoliter at kHz rates, forming large libraries of discrete 3D single‐cell microniches in which ECM can be deposited. ECM proteins are labeled using fluorescence immunostaining to allow for nondestructive analysis via flow cytometry. This approach reveals population heterogeneity in matrix deposition at unprecedented throughput, allowing for the identification and fluorescent activated cell sorting‐mediated isolation of cellular subpopulations. Additionally, it is demonstrated that inclusion of a second cell into microgels allows for studying the effect of cell‐cell contact on matrix deposition. In summary, EPIC enables high‐throughput single‐cell analysis of nascent proteins in 3D microenvironments, which is anticipated to advance fundamental knowledge and tissue engineering applications.

Abstract
The growing significance of information technology requires advanced information storage and security solutions. While extending traditional 2D codes with additional parameters has led to promising 3D codes, increasing information capacity and security remains challenging. Herein, a 3D quick response (QR) cube platform that utilizes near‐infrared (NIR)‐to‐NIR upconversion nanoparticles as light‐emitting probes, benefiting from their photostability and low scattering properties.

<title>Simultaneous Regulating the Surface, Interface, and Bulk via Phosphating Modification for High‐Performance Li‐Rich Layered Oxides Cathodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A straightforward and effective “all‐in‐one” modification strategy is exploited to achieve cooperative enhancements across the surface, interface, and bulk phase. This strategy provides a comprehensive understanding of reversible and irreversible characteristics of oxygen redox processes, offering theoretical guidance and experimental evidence for enhancing anionic redox reversibility and designing high‐performance Li‐rich Mn‐based layered oxides.








Abstract
Li‐rich Mn‐based layered oxides (LRMOs) are regarded as the leading cathode materials to overcome the bottleneck of higher energy density. Nevertheless, they encounter significant challenges, including voltage decay, poor cycle stability, and inferior rate performance, primarily due to irreversible oxygen release, transition metal dissolution, and sluggish transport kinetics. Moreover, traditionally single modification strategies do not adequately address these issues. Herein, an innovative “all‐in‐one” modification strategy is developed, simultaneously regulating the surface, interface, and bulk via an in‐situ gas–solid interface phosphating reaction to create P‐doped Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2@Spinel@Li3PO4. Specifically, Li3PO4 surface coating layer shields particles from electrolyte corrosion and enhances Li+ diffusion; in‐situ constructed spinel interfacial layer reduces phase distortion and suppresses the lattice strain; the strong P─O bond derived from P‐doping stabilizes the lattice oxygen frame and inhibits the release of O2, thereby improving the reversibility of oxygen redox reaction. As a result, the phosphatized LRMO demonstrates an exceptional capacity retention of 82.1% at 1C after 300 cycles (compared to 50.8% for LRMO), an outstanding rate capability of 170.5 mAh g−1 at 5C (vs 98.9 mAh g−1 for LRMO), along with excellent voltage maintenance and thermostability. Clearly, this “all‐in‐one” modification strategy offers a novel approach for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries.

<title>Orbital Coupling of Dual‐Atom Sites Boosts Electrocatalytic NO Oxidation and Dynamic Intracellular Response</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new strategy is proposed for the precise fabrication of orbital‐coupled dual‐atomic sites, which aims to enhance the affinity between the Ni sites and NO within Co1Ni1‐NC. This strategy is specifically designed to significantly boost the performance of the NO oxidation reaction, contributing to advancements in the field of single‐cell in situ monitoring of NO.









Abstract
In situ measurement of nitric oxide (NO) in living tissue and single cells is highly important for achieving a profound comprehension of cellular functionalities and facilitating the precise diagnosis of critical diseases; however, the progress is greatly hindered by the weak affinity of ultratrace concentration NO in cellular environment toward electrocatalysts. Herein, a new strategy is reported for precisely constructing orbital coupled dual‐atomic sites to enhance the affinity between the metal atomic sites and NO on a class of N‐doped hollow carbon matrix dual‐atomic sites Co─Ni (Co1Ni1‐NC) for greatly boosting electrocatalytic NO performance. The as‐synthesized Co1Ni1‐NC demonstrates a substantially higher current density than Ni1‐NC and Co1‐NC, coupled with exceptional stability with a negligible degradation rate of 0.6 µA·cm−2·h−1, which is the best among the state‐of‐the‐art electrocatalysts for NO oxidation. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively reveal that the pivotal role of d‐d orbit coupling between Co and Ni sites enables Ni to acquire additional electrons, leading to the occupation of Ni's 3dxy/yz within the 2π orbitals of NO, thus weakening the N≡O triple bond and concurrently accelerating NO adsorption kinetics. It is demonstrated that Co1Ni1‐NC‐coated nanoelectrode can achieve the in situ sensing of NO in living organs and single cells.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study develops a novel gelatin hydrogel through microstructural optimization. The resulting hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical properties compared to conventional methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) gels while preserving key benefits like rapid gelation, cell adhesion, and complete biodegradability. These combined properties significantly enhance the precision and complexity of gelatin hydrogels for 3D printing and their applications in biomedicine.








Abstract
Gelatin hydrogels (e.g., methacrylated gelatin gel, abbreviated GelMA gel) have garnered significant attention in tissue engineering and therapeutic drug and cell delivery due to their complete degradability and intrinsic ability to support cell adhesion. However, their practical applications are often constrained by their poor mechanical performance, which stems from their single network structure. This limitation poses significant challenges in load‐bearing scenarios and restricts their use in advanced biofabrication technologies, where robust mechanical properties are essential. Here a hydrogel is developed composed entirely of gelatin using a phototriggered transient‐radical and persistent‐radical coupling (PTPC) reaction to achieve an optimized microstructure. This hydrogel features a phase‐separated structure with enhanced interfacial bonding, significantly improving mechanical performance compared to conventional GelMA gels. Notably, this approach preserves the inherent properties of gelatin, including biocompatibility, cell adhesion, and degradability, thereby extending its applicability in the biomedical field, particularly in advanced biofabrication methods such as 3D printing. This approach offers a superior solution to meet the complex demands of sophisticated biomanufacturing technologies, expanding the potential applications of gelatin hydrogels in the biomedical field.

<title>Giant Ultrabroadband Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Engendered by Two‐Photon Absorption in α‐In2Se3 for Chiral Terahertz Wave Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work reports giant ultrabroadband two‐photon absorption (TPA) driven bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 utilizing wavelength‐tunable terahertz emission spectroscopy. Ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 outperforms standard terahertz emitters like p‐InAs, enabling efficient chiral terahertz wave emission with tunable orientation and ellipticity. The work highlights TPA‐induced BPVE in narrow‐bandgap ferroelectrics supports high‐performance BPVE devices and guides chiral THz wave design.








Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) can break the Shockley–Queisser limit by leveraging the inherent asymmetry of crystal lattice without a junction. However, this effect is mainly confined to UV–vis spectrum due to the wide‐bandgap nature of traditional ferroelectric materials, thereby limiting the exploration of the infrared light‐driven efficient BPVE. Herein, giant two‐photon absorption (TPA) driven BPVE is uncovered from visible to infrared in ferroelectric α‐In2Se3 utilizing wavelength‐tunable terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy. Remarkably, α‐In2Se3 exhibits exceptional THz emission efficiency in the infrared region, surpassing renowned THz emitters like p‐InAs and achieving an efficiency approximately eight times the magnitude of standard ZnTe. The power exponent‐type pump fluence and quadruple polarization features reveal a unique TPA‐driven BPVE, corroborated by a fourth‐order nonlinear oscillator model. Notably, TPA‐engendered BPVE efficiency approaches 68% of that observed in the single‐photon absorption process. Moreover, the TPA responses display clear polarization anisotropy, with considerably relative phase and amplitude driven by synchronous in‐plane and out‐of‐plane polarization, leading to chiral THz waves with high efficiency, tunable orientation, and controllable ellipticity. This work highlights the advantages of TPA‐induced BPVE responses in narrow‐bandgap ferroelectric semiconductors, enhancing spectral utilization efficiency, aiding high‐performance devices based on BPVE, and guiding chiral THz wave design.

This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies. When neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of stroke‐affected rats, it significantly reduces the brain infarct area, promotes synaptic reorganization, and restores motor functions and balance.









Abstract
Implantable neural probes hold promise for acquiring brain data, modulating neural circuits, and treating various brain disorders. However, traditional implantable probes face significant challenges in practical applications, such as balancing sensitivity with biocompatibility and the difficulties of in situ neural information monitoring and neuromodulation. To address these challenges, this study developed an implantable hydrogel probe capable of recording neural signals, modulating neural circuits, and treating stroke. Amylopectin is integrated into the hydrogels, which can induce reorientation of the poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) chain and create compliant interfaces with brain tissues, enhancing both sensitivity and biocompatibility. The hydrogel probe shows the capability of continuously recording deep brain signals for 8 weeks. The hydrogel probe is effectively utilized to study deep brain signals associated with various physiological activities. Neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of rats, enabling control over their limb behaviors through evoked signals. When applied to the primary motor cortex of stroke‐affected rats, neuromodulation significantly reduced the brain infarct area, promoted synaptic reorganization, and restored motor functions and balance. This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies.

A programmable, morphologically adaptive nanomaterial, FeFKC, is developed as an efficient delivery system for nanocatalytic tumor therapy. Through pH‐triggered shape‐shifting, FeFKC enhances endocytosis, lysosomal escape, and mitochondrial localization, significantly boosting its catalytic impact. It suppressed tumors by up to 95% without evident safety concerns in mouse models, indicating broad potential for future targeted therapies.








Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy holds significant promise in cancer treatment by exploiting the high oxidative stress within tumor cells. However, efficiently delivering nanocatalytic agents to tumor tissues and maximizing their catalytic activity in situ remain critical challenges. Morphology‐adaptive delivery systems, capable of adjusting their physical form in response to physiological conditions, offer unique spatiotemporal control for navigating complex biological environments like the tumor microenvironment. While designing systems that undergo multiple shape transformations often involves complex stimuli‐responsive mechanisms, making programmable responses through simple designs highly desirable yet challenging. Here, FeFKC, an innovative adaptive material is introduced that achieves multi‐step morphological transformations at the tissue level and amplifies catalytic activity through a straightforward design. As the microenvironmental pH decreases during drug delivery, FeFKC dynamically transitions between single chains, nanoparticles, and nanofibers. This programmable shape‐shifting facilitates deep tumor penetration, enhanced cellular uptake, and lysosomal escape, significantly improving its catalytic efficiency in nanocatalytic tumor therapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that FeFKC achieves impressive tumor suppression efficacy of up to 95% without notable biosafety concerns. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive nanomaterials with programmable shape‐transforming capabilities to overcome biological barriers and enhance catalytic therapy, opening new avenues for cancer treatment and other complex diseases.

Tough polyurethane hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen‐bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure are prepared by in situ water‐induced microphase separation. The outstanding mechanical performances endow the hydrogels with the capability to resist abdominal pressure and prevent hernia formation in vivo.








Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical performances similar to load‐bearing tissues are in demand for in vivo applications. In this work, inspired by the self‐assembly behavior of amphiphilic polymers, polyurethane‐based tough hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen‐bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure through in situ water‐induced microphase separation strategy are developed, in which poly(ethylene glycol)‐based polyurethane (PEG‐PU, hydrophilic) and poly(ε‐caprolactone)‐based polyurethane (PCL‐PU, hydrophobic) are blended to form dry films followed by water swelling. A multiple hydrogen bonding factor, imidazolidinyl urea, is introduced into the synthesis of the two polyurethanes, and the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between PEG‐PU and PCL‐PU can promote homogeneous microphase separation for the construction of bicontinuous phase structures in the hydrogel network, by which the hydrogel features break strength of 12.9 MPa, fracture energy of 2435 J m−2, and toughness of 48.2 MJ m−3. As a biomedical patch, the outstanding mechanical performances can withstand abdominal pressure to prevent hernia formation in the abdominal wall defect model. Compared to the commercial PP mesh, hydrogel can prevent tissue/organ adhesion to reduce inflammatory responses and promote angiogenesis, thereby accelerating the repair of abdominal wall defects. This work may provide useful inspiration for researchers to design different gel materials through solvent‐induced microphase separation.

The camouflage‐monitoring‐protection triune integrated modular unit achieves remarkable optical‐microwave compatibility, which is instructed by machine learning and further assembled into a programmable array, exhibiting extraordinary programmability, multi‐scenario adaptability, fast responsiveness, and long‐life durability. The approach paves the universal way for optical‐electromagnetic compatibility and material genetics‐deviceization systematization.








Abstract
Optical‐electromagnetic compatible devices are urgently required in intelligent building monitors and cross‐band protection. Meanwhile, the insufficient systematicness and semi‐empirical attempts significantly limit the prosperity of cross‐band materials, causing enormous challenges for deviceization and material database construction. Herein, the systematical component‐deviceization‐machine learning prediction‐array construction strategy is attempted to solve the bottleneck issues. A luminance‐triggered camouflage‐monitoring‐protection triune integrated modular unit (IMU) is hierarchically encapsulated to simultaneously achieve efficient anti‐electromagnetic interference (EMI), light‐absorbing, quick gradient‐colorization response. Moreover, an illumination intensity dataset and a surrogate model based on fully connected neural network fitting (FCNN‐fitting) are constructed, which accurately predicts the light‐absorbing property of IMUs and can be instructional for material selection. The IMUs are specifically assembled into a 4*4 array, aiming at multi‐scenario application of programmable display, camouflage pattern, surface conformality, and rapid replaceability. This work paves the path and provides a promising strategy for optical‐electromagnetic compatibility and material genetics‐deviceization‐array systematization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A metabolism‐engineered bacterium inspired by sulfur‐metabolizing bacteria is developed, functioning as a live drug that efficiently and precisely depletes the substrate cysteine, thereby completely blocking cysteine metabolism. This disruption dismantles the ferroptosis defense system in PDAC cells, triggers potent ferroptosis, and achieves effective treatment. This introduces a novel approach to treating PDAC by exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities with living engineered bacteria.









Abstract
Cysteine metabolism is a key determinant of the defense against ferroptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Blocking cysteine metabolism may trigger potent ferroptosis in PDAC cells by generating lipid peroxides during tumor metabolic processes. However, current methods to limit cysteine availability fall short, failing to efficiently block cysteine metabolism due to inadequate tumor targeting and compensatory cysteine sources. Inspired by sulfur‐metabolizing bacteria, synthetic biology to develop an engineered bacterium capable of directly depleting cysteine to block its metabolism is used. Acting as a living drug, these engineered bacteria colonize the tumor and continuously produce engineered cyst(e)inase enzyme (CGL) under the stimulation of tumor hypoxia. The CGL exhausts the substrate cysteine, completely impeding cysteine metabolism. This process dismantles the ferroptosis defense system in PDAC cells, triggers potent ferroptosis, and achieves efficient treatment. The results demonstrate that engineered bacteria designed for cysteine metabolism modulation possess unparalleled advantages in efficacy, persistence, and precision in blocking cysteine metabolism, making them highly suitable for effective ferroptosis treatment of PDAC.

2D vdW α‐In₂Se₃ is used as a ferroelectric tunneling junction in a planar structure with Au electrodes. The interface between the α‐In₂Se₃ semiconductor and the Au electrode is studied to achieve a large on/off ratio by inserting a SiO₂ insulating barrier. The polarization of α‐In₂Se₃ gradually changes with the applied pulses, mimicking synaptic properties and exhibiting linear LTP/LTD behavior.








Abstract
A synaptic memristor using 2D ferroelectric junctions is a promising candidate for future neuromorphic computing with ultra‐low power consumption, parallel computing, and adaptive scalable computing technologies. However, its utilization is restricted due to the limited operational voltage memory window and low on/off current (ION/OFF) ratio of the memristor devices. Here, it is demonstrated that synaptic operations of 2D In2Se3 ferroelectric junctions in a planar memristor architecture can reach a voltage memory window as high as 16 V (±8 V) and ION/OFF ratio of 108, significantly higher than the current literature values. The power consumption is 10−5 W at the on state, demonstrating low power usage while maintaining a large ION/OFF ratio of 108 compared to other ferroelectric devices. Moreover, the developed ferroelectric junction mimicked synaptic plasticity through pulses in the pre‐synapse. The nonlinearity factors are obtained 1.25 for LTP, −0.25 for LTD, respectively. The single‐layer perceptron (SLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) on‐chip training results in an accuracy of up to 90%, compared to the 91% in an ideal synapse device. Furthermore, the incorporation of a 3 nm thick SiO2 interface between the α‐In2Se3 and the Au electrode resulted in ultrahigh performance among other 2D ferroelectric junction devices to date.

Wafer‐scale, highly oriented (almost monocrystalline) WS2 monolayers are synthesized on C/A‐plane sapphire substrates by chemical vapor deposition. A record high saturation current density of 675 µA µm−1 is achieved based on field‐effect transistors made of such films, outperforming the index required for high‐density integration circuits in IRDS 2025.








Abstract
2D transition‐metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors represent the most promising channel materials for post‐silicon microelectronics due to their unique structure and electronic properties. However, it remains challenging to synthesize wide‐bandgap TMDCs monolayers featuring large areas and high performance simultaneously. Herein, highly oriented WS2 monolayers are reproducibly synthesized through a templated growth strategy on vicinal C/A‐plane sapphire wafers. Various spectroscopic characterizations confirm the high crystallographic orientation and uniformity across the entire wafers. Electronic measurements for samples transferred onto SiO2/Si substrates reveal high average field‐effect mobilities of 62 and 180 cm2V−1s−1 at room temperature and 8 K, respectively. On hexagonal boron nitride substrates, these mobilities increase to 94 and 473 cm2V−1s−1, respectively. A record high saturation current density of 675 µA µm−1 is observed, outperforming the index required for high‐density integration circuits in IRDS 2025. This work paves the way for the application of wide‐bandgap TMDC monolayers in post‐silicon electronics.

A new synthesis strategy for CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell colloidal quantum wells, which covers the green and blue spectral range and exhibits exceptional photoelectric properties, is achieved by direct cation exchange from Cd to Zn and hot‐injection shell growth. This enables the fabrication of high‐performance green and blue light‐emitting diodes with the peak external quantum efficiencies of 20.4% and 10.6%.








Abstract
The unique anisotropic properties of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) make them highly promising as components in nanocrystal‐based devices. However, the limited performance of green and blue light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) based on CQWs has impeded their practical applications. In this study, alloy CdZnSe core CQWs with precise compositions are tailored via direct cation exchange (CE) from CdSe CQWs with specific size, shape, and crystal structure and utilized hot‐injection shell (HIS) growth to synthesize CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell CQWs exhibiting exceptional optoelectronic characteristics. This approach enabled the successful fabrication green and blue LEDs manifesting superior performance compared to previously reported solution‐processed CQW‐LEDs. The devices demonstrated a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (20.4% for green and 10.6% for blue), accompanied by a maximum brightness 347,683 cd m−2 for green and 38,063 cd m−2 for blue. The high‐performance represents a significant advancement for nanocrystal‐based light‐emitting diodes (Nc‐LEDs) incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. This work provides a comprehensive synthesis strategy for enhancing the efficiency of Nc‐LEDs utilizing anisotropic nanocrystals.

Topological supercoupling phenomenon is demonstrated for the first time, enabling efficient waveguide coupling over separation distances ranging from sub‐wavelength to multiple wavelengths, driven by the valley vortex wave in the topological valley Hall system. This approach aims at integrating increasing number of on‐chip components to further enhance the chip compactness and density.








Abstract
Waveguide interconnect coupling control is essential for enhancing the chip density of photonic integrated circuits to incorporate a growing number of components. However, a critical engineering challenge is to achieve both strong waveguide isolation and efficient long‐range coupling on a single chip. Here, a novel photonic supercoupling phenomenon is demonstrated for waveguide coupling over separation distances from a quarter to five wavelengths (λ), leveraging the tunable mode tails and the vortex energy flow in topological valley Hall system. A supercoupled integrated chip is developed, realizing a 91% coupling ratio and a −30 dB isolation over 2.8λ waveguide separations simultaneously. Supercoupled devices are further showcased including a waveguide‐cavity system with 3.2λ excitation distance, and a waveguide directional supercoupler with a compact coupling area of nearly λ2/4, which outperform conventional devices. Supercoupling provides new degrees of freedom for optimizing coupling and isolation between photonic integrated components, facilitating new applications in on‐chip sensing, lasing, and telecommunications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The newly developed nanopolymer, constructed from quinoidal acceptor–donor–acceptor (A‐D‐A) structured organic molecules, exhibits excellent near‐infrared II (NIR‐II) light absorption, phototherapy, and photoacoustic imaging performance. Combined with the immunomodulator R848, it efficiently treats primary ovarian tumors, inhibits metastatic tumors, and also demonstrates promising efficacy in breast cancer treatment.








Abstract
Photoagents with ultra‐high near‐infrared II (NIR‐II) light energy conversion efficiency hold great promise in tumor phototherapy due to their ability to penetrate deeper tissues and minimize damage to surrounding healthy cells. However, the development of NIR‐II photoagents remain challenging. In this study, an all‐fused‐ring quinoidal acceptor‐donor‐acceptor (A‐D‐A) molecule, SKCN, with a BTP core is synthesized, and nanoparticles named FA‐SNPs are prepared. The unique quinoidal structure enhances π‐electron delocalization and bond length uniformity, significantly reducing the bandgap of SKCN, resulting in strong NIR‐II absorption, a high molar extinction coefficient, and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 75.14%. Enhanced molecular rigidity also facilitates efficient energy transfer to oxygen, boosting reactive oxygen species generation. By incorporating the immunomodulator R848, FA‐SRNPs nanoparticles are further developed, effectively modulating the tumor immune microenvironment by reducing Tregs and M‐MDSCs infiltration, promoting dendritic cell maturation, M1 macrophage polarization, and activating CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Comprehensive studies using orthotopic ovarian cancer models demonstrated strong tumor targeting, photoacoustic imaging capabilities, and significant tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition, and also showing excellent therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic breast cancer model. This study provides strong evidence for the potential application of quinoidal A‐D‐A molecules in cancer photoimmunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This manuscript reports a solid‐phase route to prepare ultrafine intermetallic libraries confined in ordered mesoporous carbon by a strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates. The intermetallic catalyst discloses remarkably high activity and stability in oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Ordered intermetallic nanocatalysts supported on high‐surface‐area skeletons are of great importance in catalysis and have disclosed notable catalytic activity and stability that are remarkably better than their random alloy counterparts. Ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts are synthetically challenging, especially for universal and scaled‐up synthesis, because of inevitable sintering and phase separation under high temperatures that promote atomic alloying and ordering. Herein, a universal solid‐phase and scaled‐up method is reported for synthesizing ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts with uniform size distributions and wide compositional spaces confined in ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) supports, where the strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates remarkably suppress the high‐temperature sintering and phase separation even up to 1000 °C. Libraries of intermetallic nanocatalysts are successfully synthesized including 52 combinations of host platinum/palladium/rhodium with 15 guest elements confined in 4 OMC supports. Taking oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions as examples, the intermetallic PtFe nanocatalysts hold remarkable performance, whose activities reach up to ten times higher than commercial Pt/C and also are comparable to the best electrocatalysts reported recently. This feasible synthetic strategy offers an intermetallic library spanning from binary to senary materials for industrial synthesis and applications.

<title>Nanozymes and Their Potential Roles in the Origin of Life</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nanozymes, as enzyme mimics, demonstrate not only enzyme‐like structures and activities but also high stability and regulated catalytic functions. Minerals are also known for catalytic roles in the origin of life. Building on this foundation, this study proposes that nanozymes may serve as highly efficient pre‐enzymatic catalysts, potentially participating in the transition from inorganic molecules to primitive cells in chemical evolution.









Abstract
The origin of life has long been a central scientific challenge, with various hypotheses proposed. The chemical evolution, which supposes that inorganic molecules can transform into organic molecules and subsequent primitive cells, laid the foundation for modern theories. Inorganic minerals are believed to play crucial catalytic roles in the process. However, the harsh reaction conditions of inorganic minerals hinder the accumulation of organic molecules, preventing the efficient transition from inorganic molecules to biomacromolecules. Given the inherent physicochemical properties and enzyme‐like activities, this study proposes that nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme‐like activities, act as efficient prebiotic catalysts in the origin of life. This hypothesis is based on the following: First, unlike traditional minerals, nanominerals can catalyze organic synthesis under milder conditions. Second, nanominerals can not only protect biomolecules from radiation damage but also catalyze polymerization reactions to form functional biomacromolecules and further lipid vesicles. More importantly, nanominerals are abundant in terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. This perspective will systematically discuss the potential roles of nanozymes in the emergence of life based on the functions of minerals and the characteristics of nanozymes. We hope the research on nanozymes and the origin of life will bridge the gap between inorganic precursors and biomolecules under primitive environments.

<title>Low‐Volatility Fused‐Ring Solid Additive Engineering for Synergistically Elongating Exciton Lifetime and Mitigating Trap Density Toward Organic Solar Cells of 20.5% Efficiency</title>

3,6‐dibromothieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (3,6TTBr) is selected as a representative low‐volatility fused‐ring solid additive to elucidate the mechanism of photovoltaic performance. The integrated theoretical and experimental study reveals that 3,6TTBr's rigid, planar molecules interact with the terminal units of L8‐BO, facilitating spacing for neighboring molecules. To validate the broader applicability of the findings, 1,5‐dibromonaphthalene (1,5‐BN) is examined, achieving a notable PCE of 20.5%.








Abstract
Volatile solid additives (VSAs) with single or fused‐ring structures have attracted much attention for enhancing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). While the working mechanisms of high‐volatility single‐ring additives have been well studied, the influence of low‐volatility fused‐ring VSAs on molecular aggregations and exciton/carrier dynamics remains still unclear. Herein, 3,6‐dibromothieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (3,6TTBr) is selected as a representative low‐volatility fused‐ring VSA to elucidate its working mechanism. Via the theoretical and experimental joint investigation, it is found that rigid and planar 3,6TTBr molecules adsorb onto the terminal units of L8‐BO (acceptor), inducing loose space for adjacent molecules. The low‐volatility 3,6TTBr thus favors the L8‐BO center‐terminal packing with a larger interfragment distance, which relieves the L8‐BO over‐aggregation and induces the ordered packing. Consequently, the 3,6TTBr treatment reduces aggregation‐caused quenching, enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield and exciton lifetime of L8‐BO film. The combination of the above properties with the reduced trap density and improved carrier transport in the 3,6TTBr‐treated devices contributed to PCE of 20.1%. To validate the broad applicability of the findings, 1,5‐dibromonaphthalene (1,5‐BN), another low‐volatility fused‐ring solid, is explored. The devices with 1,5‐BN achieved an impressive PCE of 20.5%, verifying the validity of the low‐volatility fused‐ring VSA strategy for boosting OSC performances.

A star‐shaped cross‐linked polyglutamate (StCl) nanocarrier delivers melanoma‐associated peptide antigens via redox‐responsive linkers, inducing lymph node‐targeted antigen presentation. The nanoconjugate activates dendritic cells, promotes effector T‐cell responses, and enables tumor regression even in humanized patient‐derived preclinical models. This scalable platform offers a promising approach to cancer immunotherapy and synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitors.








Abstract
Tumor‐associated antigen‐based cancer vaccines suffer from limited clinical success compared to alternative immunotherapies in melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The anti‐tumor potential of a multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccine platform – a cross‐linked star‐shaped polyglutamate carrier (StCl) with marked lymphotropic character conjugated with melanoma‐associated peptide antigens is evaluated through redox‐responsive linkers. The co‐delivery of melanoma‐associated peptide antigens by the nanoconjugate platform induced significant effector immune responses in a mouse melanoma model. The nanoconjugate platform synergized with a PD‐1 inhibitor to revert the immunosuppressive melanoma tumor microenvironment by improving cytotoxic T‐cell infiltration, which prompted a superior anti‐tumor effect with prolonged overall survival without acute organ toxicity. The antigen‐specific anti‐tumor immune response induced by the nanoconjugate platform is also validated in a melanoma patient‐derived xenograft mouse model. A promising, versatile StCl‐based platform is reported for generating off‐the‐shelf multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccines for the safe and efficient immunotherapeutic treatment of melanoma.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, an intermolecular‐reinforced ether‐based electrolyte is presented to well stabilize the aggressive NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.2 VNa. With this electrolyte, a high‐voltage aAhmpere‐hour‐level pouch cell based on the cathode and hard carbon anode shows excellent long‐term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles.








Abstract
To fulfill the requirements for practical applications, it is urgent to boost the gravimetric energy density of sodium‐ion batteries. An effective way is to increase the charging voltage of O3‐type layered cathodes preferably to 4.2 V versus Na/Na+ (VNa). Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to achieve stable cycling of the cathodes at such a high cut‐off voltage. Here a novel electrolyte strategy to design an intermolecular‐reinforced electrolyte (IRE) is presented, utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, which facilitates stable high‐voltage cycling of the commercially viable NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM). While the NFM with the IRE exhibits a high specific capacity of ≈158 mAh g−1 at 4.2 VNa (130 mAh g−1 at 4.0 VNa), the aggressive cathode surface can still be effectively stabilized by the formation of favorable thin and inorganic‐rich cathode−electrolyte interfaces. Remarkably, under a high cut‐off voltage of 4.2 VNa, an industrial ampere‐hour‐level NFM||hard carbon pouch cell with the IRE electrolyte shows an excellent long‐term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles, largely outperforming the localized high‐concentration electrolyte (82.9% after 200 cycles).

This article presents a non‐destructive molecular encoding approach using hierarchical array of functionalized graphene‐based sensors for spatiotemporal analysis of volatile signaling molecules. Combined with deep learning, this method enables real‐time imaging and genetic profiling of organoids, deciphering molecular production pathways through specific enzymes and metabolic routes and advancing precision diagnostics and personalized medicine without harmful staining or sample destruction.








Abstract
Organoids mimic human organ function, offering insights into development and disease. However, non‐destructive, real‐time monitoring is lacking, as traditional methods are often costly, destructive, and low‐throughput. In this article, a non‐destructive chemical tomographic strategy is presented for decoding cyto‐proteo‐genomics of organoid using volatile signaling molecules, hereby, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), to indicate metabolic activity and development of organoids. Combining a hierarchical design of graphene‐based sensor arrays with AI‐driven analysis, this method maps VOC spatiotemporal distribution and generate detailed digital profiles of organoid morphology and proteo‐genomic features. Lens‐ and label‐free, it avoids phototoxicity, distortion, and environmental disruption. Results from testing organoids with the reported chemical tomography approach demonstrate effective differentiation between cyto‐proteo‐genomic profiles of normal and diseased states, particularly during dynamic transitions such as epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, the reported approach identifies key VOC‐related biochemical pathways, metabolic markers, and pathways associated with cancerous transformations such as aromatic acid degradation and lipid metabolism. This real‐time, non‐destructive approach captures subtle genetic and structural variations with high sensitivity and specificity, providing a robust platform for multi‐omics integration and advancing cancer biomarker discovery.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By virtue of the tailor‐made Pt electronic configuration and excellently corrosion‐resistant carbon support, the O‐PtCo@GCoNC integrating PtCo intermetallic with a Pt‐rich shell and highly graphitized carbon exhibits significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability, attaining outstanding performance in H2/air PEMFC, outstripping the United States Department of Energy 2025 target.








Abstract
Exploiting robust and high‐efficiency electrocatalysts for sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) toward long‐term operation for practical applications, yet remains challenging. Herein, the ordered PtCo intermetallic is reported with a Pt‐rich shell loaded on a highly graphitized carbon carrier (O‐PtCo@GCoNC) prepared by an impregnation annealing strategy. Systematic X‐ray spectroscopic, operando electrochemical techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that thanks to the synergistic interaction of the core–shell PtCo intermetallic structure with a tailor‐made Pt electronic configuration and highly graphitized carbon, O‐PtCo@GCoNC exhibits significantly enhanced activity and stability toward ORR. Crucially, O‐PtCo@GCoNC delivers a much‐enhanced mass activity of 0.83 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m HClO4, which only drops by 26.5% after 70 000 cycles (0.6–1.0 V vs RHE), and 10.8% after 10 000 cycles (1.0–1.5 V vs RHE), apparently overmatching Pt/C (0.19 A mgPt−1, 73.7%, and 63.1%). Moreover, O‐PtCo@GCoNC employed as the cathode catalyst in H2/air PEMFC achieves a superb peak power density (1.04 W cm−2 at 2.06 A cm−2), outperforming that of Pt/C (0.86 W cm−2 at 1.79 A cm−2). The cell voltage loss at 0.8 A cm−2 is 28 mV after 30 000 cycles, outstripping the United States Department of Energy 2025 target.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
TADF sensitizers targeting deep‐blue emitters are designed by combining the advantages of short‐range and long‐range charge‐transfer excited states. The resulting sensitizers enable high‐performance deep‐blue OLEDs with BT. 2020 blue gamut together with external quantum efficiency approaching 40%.








Abstract
The hyperfluorescence (HF) technology holds great promise for the development of high‐quality organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) for their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and low‐efficiency roll‐off. Sensitizer plays a crucial role in the performance of HF devices. However, designing sensitizers with simultaneous high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), rapid radiative decay (kr), and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) poses a great challenge, particularly for the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers targeting deep‐blue HF device. Herein, by introducing a boron‐containing multi‐resonance‐type acceptor into the multi‐tert‐butyl‐carbazole encapsulated benzene molecular skeleton, two TADF emitters featuring hybridized multi‐channel charge‐transfer pathways, including short‐range multi‐resonance, weakened through‐bond, and compact face‐to‐face through‐space charge‐transfer. Benefiting from the rational molecular design, the proof‐of‐concept sensitizers exhibit simultaneous rapid kr of 5.3 × 107 s−1, fast kRISC up to 5.9 × 105 s−1, a PQLY of near‐unity, as well as ideal deep‐blue emission in both solution and film. Consequently, the corresponding deep‐blue HF devices not only achieve chromaticity coordinates that fully comply with the latest BT. 2020 standards, but also showcase record‐high maximum external quantum efficiencies nearing 40%, along with suppressed efficiency roll‐off.

<title>2D Vacancy Confinement in Anatase TiO2 for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activities</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new strategy to spatially confine oxygen vacancy (VO) is demonstrated in the homo‐interface of anatase TiO2. The confined VO in anatase TiO2 not only exhibits metallic behavior with high carrier density and electron mobility, but also promotes photocarrier lifetime. This synthetic strategy emphasizes how sub‐bandgap energy levels in confined imperfections influence the kinetics of light‐driven catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Light‐driven energy conversion devices call for the atomic‐level manipulation of defects associated with electronic states in solids. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancy (VO) as a source of sub‐bandgap energy levels have hampered the precise control of the distribution and concentration of VO. Here, a new strategy to spatially confine VO at the homo‐interfaces is demonstrated by exploiting the sequential growth of anatase TiO2 under dissimilar thermodynamic conditions. Remarkably, metallic behavior with high carrier density and electron mobility is observed after sequential growth of the TiO2 films under low pressure and temperature (L‐TiO2) on top of high‐quality anatase TiO2 epitaxial films (H‐TiO2), despite the insulating properties of L‐TiO2 and H‐TiO2 single layers. Multiple characterizations elucidate that the VO layer is geometrically confined within 4 unit cells at the interface, along with low‐temperature crystallization of upper L‐TiO2 films; this 2D VO layer is responsible for the formation of in‐gap states, promoting photocarrier lifetime (≈300%) and light absorption. These results suggest a synthetic strategy to locally confine functional defects and emphasize how sub‐bandgap energy levels in the confined imperfections influence the kinetics of light‐driven catalytic reactions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a photochemical synthetic route for bandgap engineering of metal halide perovskite quantum dots. Utilizing a material‐efficient microfluidic platform, the underlying mechanism of the photo‐induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER) of metal halide perovskite quantum dots is unveiled and first instance of the PIAER‐enabled synthesis of high‐performing CsPbI3 NCs is reported.








Abstract
Over the past decade, lead halide perovskite (LHP) nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted significant attention due to their tunable optoelectronic properties for next‐generation printed photonic and electronic devices. High‐energy photons in the presence of haloalkanes provide a scalable and sustainable pathway for precise bandgap engineering of LHP NCs via photo‐induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER) facilitated by in situ generated halide anions. However, the mechanisms driving photo‐induced bandgap engineering in LHP NCs remain not fully understood. This study elucidates the underlying PIAER mechanisms of LHP NCs through an advanced microfluidic platform. Additionally, the first instance of a PIAER, transforming CsPbBr3 NCs into high‐performing CsPbI3 NCs, with the assistance of a thiol‐based additive is reported. Utilizing an intensified photo‐flow microreactor accelerates the anion exchange rate 3.5‐fold, reducing material consumption 100‐fold compared to conventional batch processes. It is demonstrated that CsPbBr3 NCs act as photocatalysts, driving oxidative bond cleavage in dichloromethane and promoting the photodissociation of 1‐iodopropane using high‐energy photons. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a thiol‐based additive plays a dual role: surface passivation, which enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield, and facilitates the PIAER. These findings pave the way for the tailored design of perovskite‐based optoelectronic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, it is demonstrated that controlling metal halide precursors' reactivity with organic additives during nucleation and growth enables the synthesis of InSb CQDs with narrow size distributions. Alkanethiol resurfacing facilitates efficient ligand exchange and integration into n‐i‐p photodiodes, exhibiting 10¹2 Jones detectivity, 33% EQE at 1380 nm, and >19 h of operational stability.








Abstract
InSb colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) hold promise in short‐wave infrared sensing; however, their synthesis presents ongoing challenges, particularly in achieving precise size control – this is the result of poorly controlled reactivity among the precursors. Herein, the use of alkyl‐phosphine and amine‐based organic additives to control the reactivity of In and Sb precursors during the nucleation and growth of CQDs is developed. This interplay between organic additive and precursors enables the synthesis of InSb CQDs having narrowed size distributions; and bandgaps tunable across the 1.2–1.5 µm spectral range; all this leading to peak‐to‐valley ratios >1.4 in absorption spectra. The CQDs are surface‐terminated with a mixture of oleylamine, halides, and oxide‐like species, and this hinders ligand exchange reactions and subsequent integration into photodiodes. We therefore resurface the CQDs with alkanethiols, displacing the native ligands via an acid‐base mechanism, an approach that removes oxide species. Using a layer‐by‐layer fabrication process, the ligands of the resurfaced InSb CQDs are exchanged with short organic and halide ligands and incorporated films into n‐i‐p photodiode structures. The resultant devices exhibit a detectivity of 10¹2 Jones, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33% at 1380 nm, and T90 operating stability of >19 h under continuous illuminated operation.

Biological systems are very responsive to changes in stiffness, influencing important processes, and diseases in humans. Here, a novel method to dynamically and reversibly control hydrogel stiffness through interactions with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is presented.

Abstract
Cells are highly responsive to changes in their mechanical environment, influencing processes such as stem cell differentiation and tumor progression. To meet the growing demand for materials used for high throughput mechanotransduction studies, simple means of dynamically adjusting the environmental viscoelasticity of cell cultures are needed. Here, a novel method is presented to dynamically and reversibly control the viscoelasticity of naturally derived polymer hydrogels through interactions with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG). Interactions between PEG and hydrogel polymers, possibly involving hydrogen bonding, stiffen the hydrogel matrices. By dynamically changing the PEG concentration of the solution in which polymer hydrogels are incubated, their viscoelastic properties are adjusted, which in turn affects cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Importantly, this effects is reversible, providing a cost‐effective and simple strategy for dynamically adjusting the viscoelasticity of polymer hydrogels. This method holds promise for applications in mechanobiology, biomedicine, and the life sciences.

<title>Alkaline Adjuvant Regulates Proteolytic Activity of Macrophages for Antigen Cross‐Presentation and Potentiates Radioimmunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tissue‐repairing macrophages compromise radiotherapy‐induced antitumor immunity. An alkaline adjuvant (MgAl‐based hydrotalcite, bLDH) reverses the situation. After engendering macrophages to phagocytose irradiated cancer cells, bLDH is administrated and improves the cross‐presentation of engulfed tumor antigens over tenfold. bLDH limits the activity of phagolysosomal proteases and enables direct major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation in phagosome to improve precision radioimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Failures of radiotherapy (RT) in adaptive antitumor immunomodulation often associate with recruited tissue‐repairing macrophages. Although training these macrophages to phagocytose post‐RT cancer cells reverses their protumoral performance, engulfed tumor antigens are severely underrated. In fact, regulating the processing and presentation of tumor antigens, a key determinant of tumor immunogenicity, can fundamentally affect adaptive immune responses. Here it is reported that a simple Alum‐like adjuvant (MgAl‐based hydrotalcite, bLDH) improves radioimmunotherapy via inducing antigen cross‐presentation by macrophages, independent of phenotypes. It is identified that cytidine monophosphate guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide engenders macrophages to phagocytose irradiated cancer cells. However, as semiprofessional antigen‐presenting cells, macrophages possess powerful proteolytic function that is detrimental to antigen presentation. The administration of alkaline bLDH intriguingly relieves the activity of phagolysosomal proteases with acidic pH optima by preventing phagosomal acidification resulting from the vacuolar‐type ATPase proton pump. The adjuvant‐modulated phagolysosomes thus limit antigen degradation and enhance tumor antigen cross‐presentation over tenfold. To examine from an in vivo breast tumor model, trained macrophages successfully cross‐prime antigen‐specific CD8+ T cells and curb RT‐associated metastasis. The findings propose to pay close attention to the effect of adjuvants on precision immunotherapy and highlight the positive contribution of cross‐presenting macrophages in radioimmunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ultrathin (≈84 nm) and robust protective layer is constructed by reactive molecular brushes (GO‐g‐PSSAg). Benefiting from the in situ reaction between PSSAg side‐chains and Li metal, the modified Li anode integrates abundant Li‐ion conducting PSSLi chains, robust GO backbones, and Li–Ag solid solution, thereby enabling molecular‐level homogeneous and fast Li‐ion diffusion, remarkable mechanical strength and homogeneous Li deposition.








Abstract
Mechanically stable and structurally homogeneous lithium–electrolyte interfacial layers are crucial in stabilizing lithium (Li) anodes for practical Li metal batteries. Herein, an ultrathin (≈84 nm) and robust artificial protective layer is constructed with reactive two‐dimensional (2D) molecular brushes as building blocks. The artificial protective layer can in situ react with underlying Li metal to produce a nanoscale poly(lithium styrenesulfonate)‐grafted graphene oxide (GO‐g‐PSSLi) layer on the outermost surface and an infinite Li–Ag solid solution in the anode. The nanoscale GO‐g‐PSSLi layer well integrates a large number of single Li‐ion conducting PSSLi chains and 2D robust GO backbones, thereby enabling molecular‐level homogeneous and fast Li‐ion diffusion as well as remarkable mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the simultaneously formed Li–Ag solid solution is beneficial for rapid Li transport in the anode to reduce the Li nucleation barrier and facilitate homogeneous deposition of Li. With such artificial protective layers, a prototype pouch cell with a thin Li metal anode (50 µm) and a high‐loading cathode (21.6 mg cm−2) delivers an impressive cycle life of over 350 cycles with 69% capacity retention under harsh conditions. Remarkably, ultrahigh charging power density of 456 W kg−1 and energy density of 325 Wh kg−1 can be simultaneously achieved in an Ah‐level pouch cell.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High‐performance ultralong biomass room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) doped systems with phosphorescence quantum up to 32.8%, lifetime up to 4.65 s, and multi‐stimulus response through multiple interactions between host biomass macrocycle and guest is reported. The RTP performance of biomass macrocycle doped systems far exceeds biomass systems ever reported and compares favorably with highly effective polymer systems.








Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable, high‐performance organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with stimulus‐responsive properties presents a significant and enticing yet formidable challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy to confining boric acid‐based compounds into biomass macrocycle γ‐cyclodextrin through multiple interactions is developed, enabling the construction of high‐performance and multicolor OURTP doped systems. The synergistic effects of strong hydrogen bonding, C─O─B covalent cross‐linking, and host–guest encapsulation significantly suppress non‐radiative transition, culminating in an extraordinary lifetime and excellent phosphorescence quantum yield of 4.65 s and 32.8%, respectively, which are far superior to reported biomass RTP materials. Additionally, merging biomass macrocycle with phosphors contributes to multiple stimulus responses, overcoming the inherent limitations of degradation and recycling of organic RTP compounds, and dynamically modulating RTP signals through multiple‐stimulus responses, achieving the integration of multifunctional dynamic data processing techniques. This work will provide a direction for new environmentally friendly and potentially commercially available stimulus‐responsive OURTP materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study demonstrates the use of reactive plasma deposition (RPD) to fabricate indium tin oxide (ITO) buffer layers for wide‐bandgap perovskite solar cells. The RPD‐ITO devices exhibit enhanced thermal stability, reduced recombination losses, and improved efficiency. A four‐terminal tandem cell achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 29.03%, showcasing the potential of RPD for advanced photovoltaics.








Abstract
In this study, the potential of reactive plasma deposition (RPD) is demonstrated for fabricating indium tin oxide (ITO) as an efficient buffer layer in inverted wide‐bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This method results in a certified efficiency of 21.33% for wide‐bandgap PSCs, demonstrating superior thermal stability and operational stability. The optimized devices achieve an impressive open‐circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.252 V with a bandgap of 1.67 eV, resulting in a remarkably low voltage deficit of 0.418 V, attributed to improved electron extraction, reduced interface defects, and suppressed surface recombination. The cells maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1023 h of thermal aging at 88 °C. Furthermore, by integrating a highly efficient semi‐transparent PSC with a CIGS bottom cell, a four‐terminal tandem configuration is achieved with a total efficiency of 29.03%, representing one of the most efficient perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells reported to date. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of RPD for improving the performance and scalability of inverted wide‐bandgap PSCs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The superconducting magnetization diode effect in stacking superconductors with ferromagnetic materials heterostructures, enabling robust magnetization readout through superconductivity with an ideally infinite on/off ratio, is demonstrated. Combining spin–orbit torque for current‐driven magnetization switching, this work bridges superconductivity and spintronics, offering scalable, energy‐efficient memory solutions with simplified design and improved performance.









Abstract
Stacking superconductors (SC) with ferromagnetic materials (FM) significantly impact superconductivity, enabling the emergence of spin‐triplet states and topological superconductivity. The tuning of superconductivity in SC‐FM heterostructure is also reflected in the recently discovered superconducting diode effect, characterized by nonreciprocal electric transport when time and inversion symmetries are broken. Notably, in SC‐FM systems, a time reversal operation reverses both current and magnetization, leading to the conceptualization of superconducting magnetization diode effect (SMDE). In this variant, while the current direction remains fixed, the critical currents shall be different when reversing the magnetization. Here, the existence of SMDE in SC‐FM heterostructures is demonstrated. SMDE uniquely maps magnetization states onto superconductivity by setting the read current between two critical currents for the positive and negative magnetization directions, respectively. Thus, the magnetization states can be read by measuring the superconductivity, while the writing process is accomplished by manipulating magnetization states through current‐driven spin–orbit torque to switch the superconductivity. The proposed superconducting diode magnetoresistance in SC‐FM heterostructures with an ideally infinite on/off ratio resolves the limitations of tunneling magnetoresistance in the magnetic tunneling junctions, thereby contributing to the advancement of superconducting spintronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High‐speed and inexpensive deposition techniques are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. Rapid drying principle deriving hot dipping and air knife sweeping deposition protocols achieves film uniformity, scalability, and tunable thickness simultaneously by suppressing time for secondary flows. The large‐area extendibility, pinhole‐less feature, and m2 min−1‐level deposition speed offer unprecedented processes for 2D materials‐based nanodevices more cheaply.








Abstract
Inexpensive, high‐speed deposition techniques that ensure uniformity, scalability, wide applicability, and tunable thickness are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. In this work, rapid drying is identified as a key mechanism for pioneering two high‐speed wet deposition methods: hot dipping and air knife sweeping (AKS). Both techniques allow thickness control proportional to flake concentration, achieving tiled monolayers and pinhole‐free coverage across the entire substrate, as long as evaporation outpaces flake diffusion. AKS prevents non‐uniformity along substrate edges by eliminating contact line pinning. The achieved deposition speed of 0.21 m2 min−1 with AKS significantly surpasses traditional methods, enabling the equipment for large substrates > 1 m2. Combined with the ultralow debonding force for mechanically susceptible flexible display production and short‐circuit‐proof nanometer‐thin capacitors with capacitance comparable to commercial multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), these new protocols showcase simple and swift solutions for manufacturing 2D materials‐based nanodevices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase‐filed simulations, a strategy of controlling the morphology and ordering of Al2O3 fillers in Pb‐based AFE composite ceramics is proposed, aiming to improve its breakdown strength. Significantly improved Eb of 570 kV cm−1 and ultrahigh Wrec of 13.2 J cm−3 are achieved in composite ceramics with parallel‐aligned Al2O3 plates.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors possessing high power density and ultrashort discharge time are valuable for high‐power energy storage applications. However, achieving high energy storage density remains challenging due to the limited breakdown strength of dielectric ceramics. In this study, inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase‐field simulations, a strategy of constructing a nacre‐like layered structure is proposed to improve the breakdown strength and energy storage density of the ceramics. This unique structure is formed by controlling the morphology and ordering of high‐voltage‐resistant fillers in a ceramic matrix. The (Pb0.98La0.02)(Zr0.7Sn0.3)0.995O3‐Al2O3 antiferroelectric composite ceramics, containing 5vol% parallel‐aligned Al2O3 plates, demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in breakdown strength from 390 to 570 kV cm−1. Of particular importance is that an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density of up to 13.2 J cm−3 is achieved, representing a 50% enhancement compared to the pure ceramic (8.7 J cm−3). The parallel‐aligned Al2O3 plates are strongly bound together with the ceramic matrix, effectively blocking charge migration and controlling the breakdown path, thus greatly enhancing the voltage endurance of the composite ceramics. This work provides an innovative approach to designing high‐performance composite ceramics for next‐generation energy storage applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A fully conjugated 2D hexaimino‐substituted triphenylene‐based metal‐organic framework (2D‐HATP‐cMOF) based composite membrane is reported for nanofluidic photoelectric conversion. Owing to the intrinsic advantage of multiple charge transport pathways, and open framework with nano‐spaced, high‐density pores, the 2D‐HATP‐cMOF‐based composite membrane possesses fast photoelectric response, successful ion pump phenomenon, and efficient photoelectric energy conversion.








Abstract
Nanofluidic photoelectric conversion system based on photo‐excitable 2D materials can directly transduce light stimuli into an ion‐transport‐mediated electric signal, showing potential for mimicking the retina's function with a more favorable human–robot interactions. However, the current membranes suffer from low generation efficiency of charge carriers due to the mixed microstructure and limited charge transport ability caused by the large interlayer spacing and monotonous pathway. Here, a fully conjugated 2D hexaimino‐substituted triphenylene‐based metal–organic framework (2D‐HATP‐cMOF) based composite membrane with high conductivity for photoelectric conversion is presented. The extended π‐d conjugation within the ab plane and the favorable transport pathway through π–π stacking of the c‐MOF maximize the generation and transfer of charge carrier and greatly accelerate the ion transport. As a result, the 2D‐HATP‐cMOF‐based composite membrane possesses ultrafast photoelectric response, superior to other reported 2D systems like graphene oxide (GO), transition metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (MXene), and MoS2, which require at least 10 s. A successful ion pump phenomenon, that is active transport from low concentration to high concentration as an important way of information transmission in organisms, is realized based on the efficient photoelectric conversion capability. This work demonstrates the great promise of 2D c‐MOF in ionic photoelectric conversion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
AgTiPS6 atomic layers, the 2D in‐plane anisotropic material with cross‐stacked motifs, are discovered and added to the 2D material family. They feature a thick monolayer, strong stability, and inherent anisotropy. As an in‐plane anisotropic 2D semiconductor, AgTiPS6‐based photodetectors demonstrate excellent photoresponse across a broad range from visible to mid‐infrared, as well as high in‐plane electrical (≈5.44) and optoelectrical (≈2.44) anisotropies. 








Abstract
2D anisotropic materials, typically consisting of 1D distorted chains arranged in parallel or anti‐parallel patterns, are gaining attention for their potential in anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices. 2D anisotropic materials with cross‐stacked interconnected 1D chains will show improved anisotropy and stability. Nonetheless, to date, no 2D anisotropic materials featuring cross‐stacked motifs have been experimentally realized. This work identifies AgTiPS6 atomic layers, the 2D in‐plane anisotropic material with cross‐stacked structural motifs, as an n‐type semiconductor with a 1.0 eV band gap. Significantly, the unique cross‐stacked configuration of 2D AgTiPS6 results in a significant in‐plane anisotropy, with electrical and optoelectrical anisotropies measuring 5.44 and 2.44, respectively, as well as an axially orientation selectivity. Meanwhile, a broadband response from visible (Vis, 405 nm) to middle infrared (MIR, 10.6 µm) is achieved in the AgTiPS6‐based photodetector, with the photoresponse above the bandgap attributed to photothermoelectric effect. Furthermore, 2D AgTiPS6 has demonstrated environmental stability exceeding 12 months and a laser damage threshold exceeding 10 W cm−2, attributed to its extra‐thick monolayer (1.32 nm). This work introduces a novel in‐plane anisotropic material, expanding the repertoire of 2D anisotropic materials and offering potential for the development of anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stretchable bioelectronics conforming to dynamic body surfaces enable high‐fidelity physiological monitoring but often suffer from motion artifacts. All‐printed strain‐insensitive bioelectronics are presented using a universal gradient interface (UGI) created via aerosol‐based multi‐materials printing (AMMP). The UGI minimizes local strain changes under 180% stretch, supporting artifact‐free sensors for health monitoring and advancing wearable and implantable bioelectronics for personalized healthcare.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on‐skin devices for high‐fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain‐induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here all‐printed super stretchable strain‐insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) are reported to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol‐based multi‐materials printing technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain‐insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% uniaxial stretch ratio. Various stretchable devices are directly printed on the UGI for on‐skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near‐perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor‐based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal‐based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real‐time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, this work constructs a novel DNA nanopatch (DNPs)‐modified bacteriophages (P‐Sg) therapeutic platform (DNPs@P) for precise, gut‐targeted therapy that potently reduces inflammation and prevents the colonic inflammation‐to‐carcinoma transition. To protect DNPs@P from the harsh gastrointestinal environment, this work encapsulates them with an enteric polymer acrylic resin (L100‐55) (DNPs@P‐L). Upon oral administration, the L100‐55, ensures their safe passage through the stomach and release in the intestine. Then P‐Sg target and lyse pathogenic bacteria at inflammatory sites, delivering DNPs precisely to affected regions, which can scavenge ROS in the inflammatory site.








Abstract
Persistent inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases Streptococcus gallolyticus (Sg) colonization, increasing the risk of colorectal cancer progression via the Sg‐activated cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) pathway and β‐catenin upregulation. This study presents Sg‐specific bacteriophages modified with DNA nanopatches (DNPs@P) designed to treat IBD and prevent Sg‐induced malignancy. The DNPs are composed of DNA origami nanosheets and phage capture strands. The DNPs scavenge reactive oxygen species, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the phages while targeting and lysing pathogenic bacteria. Coating with an enteric polymer, DNPs@P ensures effective delivery in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate significant restoration of colonic length, reduced inflammation, and improved gut microbiota diversity compared with current clinical treatments. Additionally, DNPs@P effectively prevents colonic tumourigenesis in mouse models. This approach presents a promising strategy for treating gastrointestinal diseases by remodeling the gut microenvironment, addressing a critical gap in current therapies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dual‐descriptor approach is developed to design high‐voltage electrolytes, combining Mulliken charge and Laplacian bond order to identify ideal solvents. Acetonitrile (AN) stabilizes meta‐stable transition metal atoms and mitigates lattice oxygen instability at the cathode‐electrolyte interface. This strategy enables precise control of interfacial stability, advancing high‐voltage lithium‐ion batteries with a versatile and adaptive framework.








Abstract
Electrolyte engineering to enhance the cathode‐electrolyte interface stability is widely recognized as a promising strategy for achieving high‐voltage lithium‐ion batteries, which are currently hindered by the meta‐stable surface of lithium‐rich layered oxides. Despite significant progress in electrolyte development, clear design guidelines for high‐voltage electrolytes remain lacking, making solvent selection unpredictable. Here, a dual‐descriptor tailoring concept based on Mulliken charge (adsorption) and Laplacian bond order (antioxidation) to identify ideal solvent molecules for high‐voltage electrolytes is proposed. This concept stabilizes meta‐stable transition metal atoms in surface tetrahedral interstices through interactions between bottom solvent molecules and cathode dangling bonds. Acetonitrile (AN) is eventually selected as a promising bottom solvent that interacts strongly with unstable surface bonds, improving interfacial stability. Consequently, the prepared 0.6 Ah graphite||LCO pouch cell using AN‐based electrolyte maintained a remarkable 80% capacity retention after 900 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% at high cut‐off voltage. This work revisits the interfacial stability mechanism across different electrolyte classes, where strong solvent adsorption mitigates the instability of the meta‐stable Co spin state, reduces surface band overlap, and alleviates the instability of lattice oxygen at the interface. This dual‐descriptor‐guided design opens a new avenue for high‐voltage Li‐ion batteries is believed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated every aspect of science, including polymer research. Researchers from both fields need to collaborate to understand the challenges and opportunities of each domain. This review is therefore written by mathematicians and polymer chemists to highlight the key research questions polymer chemists aim to address and how machine learning can assist in answering them.








Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly being applied in polymer chemistry to link chemical structures to macroscopic properties of polymers and to identify chemical patterns in the polymer structures that help improve specific properties. To facilitate this, a chemical dataset needs to be translated into machine readable descriptors. However, limited and inadequately curated datasets, broad molecular weight distributions, and irregular polymer configurations pose significant challenges. Most off the shelf mathematical models often need refinement for specific applications. Addressing these challenges demand a close collaboration between chemists and mathematicians as chemists must formulate research questions in mathematical terms while mathematicians are required to refine models for specific applications. This review unites both disciplines to address dataset curation hurdles and highlight advances in polymer synthesis and modeling that enhance data availability. It then surveys ML approaches used to predict solid‐state properties, solution behavior, composite performance, and emerging applications such as drug delivery and the polymer–biology interface. A perspective of the field is concluded and the importance of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data and the integration of polymer theory and data are discussed, and the thoughts on the machine–human interface are shared.

Systematic amino acid substitution screening yields programmable peptide frameworks, facilitating the advanced engineering of features such as frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architectures, affinity enrichment, stimuli‐responsive behavior, and signal amplification. This approach revolutionizes multicomponent peptide assembly, offering enhanced complexity, versatility, and multifunctional potential.








Abstract
Covalent peptide assembly leverages robust covalent bonds and dynamic non‐covalent interactions to provide enhanced stability and introduce diverse functionalities. Nevertheless, it remains significantly challenging to achieve modular control over the structural diversity and functional complexity while elucidating how specific amino acid sequences contribute to these processes. Here, the systematic encoding of peptide derivative characteristics is demonstrated through amino acid modularity to enable precise control over both the structural diversity and functional complexity in covalent peptide assemblies. By systematically screening single amino acid substitutions in pentapeptides using tyrosine crosslinking, a diverse library of peptide constructs is developed. Each construct is tailored to exhibit distinct properties, including charge repulsion, aggregation‐induced quenching, disassembly behavior, and redox responsiveness. The strategic manipulation of sequence composition, both in individual assemblies and combinatorial systems, enables programmable control over the structural diversity and functional complexity. This approach yields various module‐specific functions, including frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architecture formation, affinity enrichment, stimuli‐responsive behavior, and fluorescence signal amplification. This work establishes a framework for the design of modular peptide materials with programmable functionalities, advancing the development of next‐generation multicomponent peptide assembly technologies characterized by unprecedented complexity and adaptability.

A smart NIR‐to‐visible photon upconversion (UC) device with integrated photodetection (PD) and electroluminescence functionalities is developed. The device continuously monitors incident light intensity through its PD function and compensates for UC emission under low light conditions to achieve clear visualization of weak NIR light.








Abstract
Visualizing weak NIR light is critical for sensing, imaging, and communication, but remains challenging due to inefficient detection and upconversion (UC) mechanisms. A smart NIR‐to‐visible photon‐UC organic optoelectronic device is reported that integrates photodetection, light‐emitting diode (LED), and photovoltaic capabilities to enable clear visualization of weak NIR light. The programmable device has continuous photodetection monitoring of the incident NIR intensity. When the incident intensity falls below a preset threshold, the LED function is automatically triggered to compensate for the UC emission, amplifying the visualization. The smart multifunctional device uses a carefully designed ternary bulk heterojunction sensitizer doped with rubrene:DBP as the emitter. It demonstrates high UC efficiency (>1.5%) for upconversion from 808 to 608 nm, allowing NIR visualization without external power under strong illumination. It also shows excellent NIR photodetection with photoresponsivity of 0.35 A W−1 at 800 nm and specific detectivity reaching 10¹2–10¹3 Jones, enabling sensitive detection under low‐light conditions. It also exhibits a low turn‐on voltage (0.9 V) and luminance exceeding 1200 cd m−2 at 5 V, ensuring energy‐efficient light compensation. Furthermore, it achieves >10% power conversion efficiency, enabling sustainable self‐powered operation. This multifunctional, high‐performance system offers great potential in sensing, energy harvesting, and display technologies.

<title>A Genetically Encoded Endogenous Antibody Recruitment Strategy for Innate Immune‐Mediated Killing of Cancer Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Antibody‐recruiting molecules (ARMs) can redirect endogenous antibodies to target cancer cells and induce killing; however, currently, they are limited by low antibody affinity. This study presents a novel ARM strategy using lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA encoding the common allergen Der p 2, fused to a membrane anchor, enabling high‐affinity antibody recruitment. In mice, this approach reduces pulmonary metastasis, with neutrophils as key effector cells. This mRNA LNP strategy offers promise for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Antibody‐recruiting molecules (ARMs) are bivalent molecules that contain a cell‐binding domain and an antibody‐binding domain. ARMs are designed to redirect circulating endogenous antibodies from the bloodstream to the surface of cancer cells and thereby trigger innate immune‐mediated killing of the latter. The current generation of clinically explored ARMs relies on synthetic small molecule haptens. However, their effectiveness is restricted by the low affinity of the available repertoire of endogenous anti‐hapten antibodies. Utilizing endogenous high‐affinity allergen‐specific antibodies could potentially circumvent this issue. In this study, a genetically encoded antibody‐recruiting strategy that utilizes lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver mRNA encoding the house dust mite allergen Der p 2, fused to a cell membrane anchor, to induce cell surface display and enable the recruitment of anti‐Der p 2 antibodies, is presented. Der p 2 mRNA LNP‐treated cancer cells cause greatly reduced pulmonary tumor burden in Der p 2 immunized mice, compared to untreated cells or nonimmunized mice. Reduced tumor growth is dependent on circulating antibodies, and neutrophils are identified as a key immune cell subset recognizing and eliminating Der p 2‐displaying cancer cells. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of mRNA LNPs as a powerful tool for generating a genetically encoded ARM strategy, with potential applications in cancer immunotherapy.

<title>Anisotropic Electrical Transport in Mechanically Responsive Silver‐Coated Microparticle‐Gel Composites for Flowable Semiconducting Materials</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A stimuli‐responsive soft semiconducting composite is prepared with silver microspheres dispersed in a viscoelastic copolymer gel. With an electric field arcing parallel to the applied flow rate, an enhanced electrical signal is detected due to microstructural particle alignment in the same direction that promotes electron transport.








Abstract
Soft materials with reversible electrical and mechanical properties are critical for the development of advanced bioelectronics that can distinguish between different rates of applied strain and eliminate performance degradation over many cycles. However, the current paradigm in mechano‐electronic devices involves measuring changes in electrical current based on the accumulation of strain within a conductive material that alters the geometry through which electrons flow. Attempts have been made to incorporate soft materials like liquid metals and concentrated solutions of conjugated polymers and salts to overcome materials degradation but are limited in their ability to detect changes in the rate of the applied strain. Herein, the anisotropic electrical performance of a soft semiconducting composite prepared with silver‐coated microspheres dispersed within a swollen copolymer gel is demonstrated. This composite exhibits an electrical response proportional to the magnitude of the applied shear force to enable a rate‐of‐strain dependent conductivity. Furthermore, a 100‐fold increase in the conductivity of the composite is observed when the electric field is oriented parallel to the flow direction. This improvement in the electrical response can be attributed to the enhanced alignment of microspheres in viscoelastic media and can be leveraged in the development of mechanically responsive electronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multidimensional biomimetic cascade strategy for bone regeneration is developed by emulating the biomineralization cascade, hierarchical structure, and biological functions of bone tissue. The resulting composite, named “Osteomimix”, exhibits spontaneous in situ biomimetic mineralization in a cell‐free way, while fosters vascularized bone formation in a cell‐dependent way.








Abstract
Despite advancements in biomimetic mineralization techniques, the repair of large‐scale bone defects remains a significant challenge. Inspired by the bone formation process, a multidimensional biomimetic cascade strategy is developed by replicating the biomineralization cascade, emulating the hierarchical structure of bone, and biomimicking its biological functions for efficient bone regeneration. This strategy involves the photocrosslinking of sodium methacrylate carboxymethyl cellulose‐stabilized amorphous magnesium‐calcium phosphate with methacrylate‐modified type I collagen to create a self‐mineralizing hydrogel. The hydrogel is then integrated with either naturally derived or synthetic oriented bulk scaffolds. The resulting composite, named Osteomimix, provides excellent mechanical support and can be customized for irregular bone defects using CAD/CAM technology. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, this work finds that Osteomimix exhibits spontaneous in situ biomimetic mineralization in a cell‐free environment, while modulating immune responses and promoting vascularized bone formation in a cell‐dependent manner. Built on bone‐specific insights, this strategy achieves biomimicry across temporal, spatial, and functional dimensions, facilitating the seamless integration of artificial constructs with the natural tissue repair dynamics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new family of porous methylated triazine‐based linear conjugated polymers is developed for successful photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. The key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine‐based frameworks.








Abstract
The development of semiconducting conjugated polymers for photoredox catalysis holds great promise for sustainable utilization of solar energy. Herein a new family of porous methylated triazine‐based linear conjugated polymers is reported that enable efficient photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. It is demonstrated that the key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine‐based frameworks. It is also shown that regulating conjugated linear backbones with different lengths of electron‐donated benzyl units provides a facile means to modulate their optical properties and the exciton dissociation, thereby affording more long‐lived photogenerated charge carriers and boosting charge separation and transfer. A high‐performance carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 218.9 µmol g−1 h−1 is achieved with ≈ 100% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by exceptional H2O oxidation to oxygen (O2). It anticipates this new study will advance synthetic approaches toward polymeric semiconductors and facilitate new possibilities for triazine‐based conjugated polymers with promising potential in artificial photocatalysis.

<title>Atomic Layer Deposition Stabilizes Nanocrystals, Enabling Reliably High‐Performance Quantum Dot LEDs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al₂O₃ on ZnMgO nanocrystals eliminates aging‐induced performance variability in quantum dot light‐emitting diodes (QD‐LEDs). This scalable passivation strategy suppresses nanocrystal ripening and passivates surface traps, achieving reproducible 17% external quantum efficiency, a tenfold increase in device operational stability, and consistent performance sustained over 39 weeks.








Abstract
Quantum dot light‐emitting diodes (QD‐LEDs) with stable high efficiencies are crucial for next‐generation displays. However, uncontrollable aging, where efficiency initially increases during storage (positive aging) but is entirely lost upon extended aging (negative aging), hinders further device development. It is uncovered that it is chemical changes to nanocrystal (NC)‐based electron transport layer (ETL) that give rise to positive aging, their drift in structure and morphology leading to transiently improved charge injection balance. Using grazing‐incidence small‐angle X‐ray scattering, it is found that ZnMgO NCs undergo size‐focusing ripening during aging, improving size uniformity and creating a smoother energy landscape. Electron‐only device measurements reveal a sevenfold reduction in trap states, indicating enhanced surface passivation of ZnMgO. These insights, combined with density functional theory calculations of ZnMgO surface binding, inspire an atomic layer deposition (ALD) strategy with Al₂O₃ to permanently suppress surface traps and inhibit NC growth, effectively eliminating aging‐induced efficiency loss. This ALD‐engineered ZnMgO ETL enables reproducible external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 17% across 30 batches of LEDs with a T60 of 60 h at an initial luminance of 4500 cd m−2, representing a 1.6‐fold increase in EQE and a tenfold improvement in operating stability compared to control devices.

<title>“Pumping” Trace Cu Impurity out of Zn Foil for Sustainable Aqueous Battery Interface</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202420166?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Copper exists as trace impurity in commercial Zn foil and generally gets ignored in terms of its potential for regulating Zn electrodeposition. Herein, it is demonstrated how trace amount of internal Cu atoms can be readily “pumped” out, in one step, to get concentrated on Zn foil surface and to further suppress dendritic Zn electrodeposition as a sustainable aqueous battery interface.









Abstract
Dendritic zinc (Zn) electrodeposition presents a significant obstacle to the large‐scale development of rechargeable zinc‐ion batteries. To mitigate this challenge, various interfacial strategies have been employed. However, these approaches often involve the incorporation of foreign materials onto Zn anode surface, resulting in increased material costs and processing complexities, not to mention the compromised interface endurability due to structural and compositional heterogeneity. Realizing that Cu atoms typically exist as trace impurities in commercial Zn, a novel approach is demonstrated that leverages these Cu impurities to create a Cu‐rich surface for effective modulation of Zn electrodeposition. By simply heating commercially available Zn foil with a naturally oxidized surface, not only the internal Cu atoms are thermally activated to become diffusible, their diffusion is also navigated toward the surface via oxygen attraction. The resulting Cu‐rich surface effectively regulates Zn electrodeposition, comparable to conventional interfacial strategies, yet exhibits superior cycling durability. 3D in situ microscopy confirms that this Cu‐rich surface enables dendrite‐free, compact, and (101)‐oriented Zn electrodeposition, contrasting with the traditional (002)‐oriented dendrite‐suppression mechanism. By transforming trace Cu impurity within Zn foil into a Cu‐rich surface, this work demonstrates a straightforward, cost‐effective and efficient method for controlling Zn electrodeposition.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Protein can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation and liquid‐to‐solid transition to form liquid condensates and solid aggregates. These phase transitions can be influenced by post‐translational modifications, mutations, and various environmental factors. Effective modulation of protein phase behavior offers promising applications in drug discovery, delivery, and fabrication of multifunctional protein‐based liquid and solid materials.








Abstract
Protein phase transitions play a vital role in both cellular functions and pathogenesis. Dispersed proteins can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation to form condensates, a process that is reversible and highly regulated within cells. The formation and physicochemical properties of these condensates, such as composition, viscosity, and multiphase miscibility, are precisely modulated to fulfill specific biological functions. However, protein condensates can undergo a further liquid‐to‐solid state, forming β‐sheet‐rich aggregates that may disrupt cellular function and lead to diseases. While this phenomenon is crucial for biological processes and has significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases, the phase behavior of naturally derived or engineered proteins and polypeptides also presents opportunities for developing high‐performance, multifunctional materials at various scales. Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents a simple self‐assembly strategy to construct Type I photosensitizer nanocluster. Facile intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer within nanocluster forms photosensitizer radical cation and anion via autoionization. These radicals engage in cascade photoredox to generate efficient reactive oxygen species, achieving 97.6% antibacterial efficacy against MRSA that surpasses the efficacy of commercial antibiotic Vancomycin by 8.8‐fold.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds significant promise for antibacterial treatment, with its potential markedly amplified when using Type I photosensitizers (PSs). However, developing Type I PSs remains a significant challenge due to a lack of reliable design strategy. Herein, a Type I PS nanocluster is developed via self‐assembly of zwitterionic small molecule (C3TH) for superior antibacterial PDT in vivo. Mechanism studies demonstrate that unique cross‐arranged C3TH within nanocluster not only shortens intermolecular distance but also inhibits intermolecular electronic‐vibrational coupling, thus facilitating intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer to form PS radical cation and anion via autoionization reaction. Subsequently, these highly oxidizing or reducing PS radicals engage in cascade photoredox to generate efficient ·OH and O2‾·. As a result, C3TH nanoclusters achieve a 97.6% antibacterial efficacy against MRSA at an ultralow dose, surpassing the efficacy of the commercial antibiotic Vancomycin by more than 8.8‐fold. These findings deepen the understanding of Type I PDT, providing a novel strategy for developing Type I PSs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The lamellar rare‐earth oxychlorides (REOCl) are innovatively used as promoters for ruthenium (Ru) as alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. The [RE2O2] and [Cl] layers act as the negative and positive charge transfer channels, respectively, which endows Ru surface with a high density of electrons, thus accelerating the hydroxyl peeling process.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline environments is vital for hydrogen production, owing to the extra water dissociation and hydroxyl desorption steps. Here, rare‐earth oxychlorides (REOCl) are proposed as innovative promoters for ruthenium as HER electrocatalyst in alkali. The lamellar structure of REOCl with weakly bond [Cl] layers can facilitate the formation of an internal electric field that enhances interphase charge transfer. Taking ruthenium/ neodymium oxychloride (Ru/NdOCl) composites as a case study, sub ≈4 nm Ru nanoparticles are successfully embedded into NdOCl crystals through a rapid self‐exothermic process, and the highly‐coupled Ru−Cl/O−Nd interfaces are observed as metallic Ru particles with the edge of the NdOCl lamellar layers, where the [Nd2O2] and [Cl] layers act as the negative and positive charge transfer channels, respectively. The enhanced charge transfer between REOCl and Ru makes the highly‐coupled Ru/REOCl catalysts show better electrocatalytic activity than both the benchmark Pt and Ru catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. This work will encourage more novel promoters for electrocatalysis and other emerging technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A liquid–gas phase‐changing pneumatic actuator driven by optical light is introduced. By precisely controlling the light spot using a magnifying glass, the fiber actuator rolls on a horizontal plane in daylight. With an annular design, the actuator achieved vertical crawling under a fixed visible light source. It also demonstrates promising potential for load propulsion in forward movement. 








Abstract
Light‐driven wireless actuators provide obvious advantages for remote control. However, traditional double‐layer actuators are restricted to the thin film deformation mode when undertaking complex tasks. Here, an actuator is proposed that employs thermal strain and local photothermal effects induced by low boiling point liquids to generate asymmetry along the fiber axis, thereby causing elastic deformation of the fiber. Under continuous irradiation, the sustained elastic deformation results in dynamic frustration within the fiber, creating torque around its axis. Based on this principle, the fiber actuator fabricated in this study enables rolling translation, while the ring actuator achieves simultaneous rolling and lifting motion for object manipulation. Continuous rolling under light eliminates the need for complex light manipulation. This new movement method offers an insight for various application scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic‐electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction.








Abstract
Superior properties in organic mixed ionic‐electronic conductors (OMIECs) over inorganic counterparts have inspired intense interest in biosensing, soft‐robotics, neuromorphic computing, and smart medicine. However, slow ion transport relative to charge transport in these materials is a limiting factor. Here, it is demonstrated that hydrophilic molecules local to an interfacial OMIEC nanochannel can accelerate ion transport with ion mobilities surpassing electrophoretic transport by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, ion access to this interfacial channel can be gated through local surface energy. This mechanism is applied in a novel sensing device, which electronically detects and characterizes chemical reaction dynamics local to the buried channel. The ability to enhance ion transport at the nanoscale in OMIECs as well as govern ion transport through local chemical signaling enables new functionalities for printable, stretchable, and biocompatible mixed conduction devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, bi‐confinement effects arising from a highly cross‐linked polymer network and rigid Al₂O₃ matrix are exploited to achieve ultra‐stable carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The obtained CPDs@Al2O3 composite demonstrates exceptional long‐term stability in various solvents and high photoluminescence emission thermotolerance up to 500 K for 150 h, representing the best performance of carbon dots under harsh conditions reported to date.








Abstract
Carbon dots are emerging luminescent nanomaterials that have drawn considerable attention due to their abundance, environmental friendliness, and customizable optical properties. However, their susceptibility to temperature‐induced vibrational exciton changes and the tendency to thermal quenching of emission have hindered their practical applications. Here, a method is reported for achieving high‐temperature photoluminescence carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) through a bi‐confinement approach that involves a highly cross‐linked polymer network and a rigid Al2O3 matrix. As the temperature increased from 303 to 500 K, the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission intensities of CPDs@Al2O3 remained virtually unchanged, with the emission duration exceeding 150 h at 500 K. Additionally, CPDs@Al2O3 composites with different degrees of carbonization exhibit dynamic excitation‐dependent photoluminescence properties, which can be patterned for multiple information encryption application. This work provides a concept for designing stable and luminous CPDs under harsh conditions, thus expanding their potential application range.

<title>Soft‐Actuated Cuff Electrodes with Minimal Contact for Bidirectional Peripheral Interfaces</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Soft‐actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) for bidirectional peripheral interfaces enable minimal and secure contact to the nerve through fluid injection‐based soft actuation. A 3D bent structure can grasp and securely contact the nerves with only a little pressure (<1.21 gram‐force). The SACE can achieve negligible damage to the nerve during recording of sensory and motor feedback signals with superior SNR and neuromodulation for long‐term studies.








Abstract
Neural interfaces with embedded electrical functions, such as cuff electrodes, are essential for monitoring and stimulating peripheral nerves. Still, several challenges remain with cuff electrodes because sutured devices can damage the nerve by high pressure and the secured contact of electrodes with the nerve is hard to accomplish, which however is essential in maintaining electrical performance. Here, a sutureless soft‐actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) that can envelop the nerve conveniently by creating a bent shape controlled upon fluid injection, is introduced. Moreover, fluid injection protrudes part of the device where electrodes are formed, thereby achieving minimized, soft but secure contact between the electrodes and the nerve. In vivo results demonstrate the successful recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves over time up to 6 weeks. While securing contact with the nerve, the implanted electrodes can preserve the nerve intact with no reduction in blood flow, thereby indicating only minimal compressive force applied to the nerve. The SACE is expected to be a promising tool for recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves toward bidirectional neuroprostheses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A robust photo‐/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase‐transition micro‐nanostructures has been developed through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface demonstrates highly efficient, long‐term stable anti‐/de‐icing performance, as well as exceptional superhydrophobicity. A key breakthrough is the resolution of the mechanical interlocking issue, a common challenge for the practical application of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti‐/de‐icing.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces present a promising energy‐saving solution for anti‐/de‐icing, offering effective icing delay and photothermal de‐icing capabilities. However, a significant challenge in their practical application is the mechanical interlocking of micro‐nanostructures with ice formed from condensed water vapor, leading to meltwater retention and compromised functionality post‐de‐icing. Here, a robust photo‐/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase‐transition micro‐nanostructures are demonstrated through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface exhibits ultra‐efficient, long‐term stable anti‐/de‐icing performance and excellent superhydrophobicity, demonstrating an icing delay of ≈ 1250 s, photothermal de‐icing in 8 s, water contact angle of 165°, and sliding angle of 0.2°. Furthermore, the surface maintains efficient anti‐/de‐icing ability and water repellency after 400 linear abrasion cycles under 0.93 MPa. Remarkably, under simulated natural icing conditions, where water vapor freezes within the micro‐nanostructures causing mechanical interlocking, the surface remains entirely non‐wetted after photo‐/electrothermal de‐icing, maintaining superhydrophobicity and effectiveness for continued anti‐/de‐icing. This exceptional performance is attributed to the designed phase‐transition micro‐nanostructures that liquefy during de‐icing, significantly reducing interactions with water molecules, as quantitatively validated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides new perspectives and methodologies for designing and creating innovative, high‐performance anti‐/de‐icing surfaces.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The multifunctionality of reentrant microcavity geometries for different materials is investigated, and a novel and efficient method for fabricating such geometry is proposed by analyzing capillary fluid behavior. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods to provide a cost‐effective and high‐throughput solution for generating multifunctional reentrant surfaces, which is expected to be utilized in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to their unique structural robustness, interconnected reentrant structures offer multifunctionality for various applications. a scalable multistep roll‐to‐roll printing method is proposed for fabricating reentrant microcavity surfaces, coined as wetting‐induced interconnected reentrant geometry (WING) process. The key to the proposed WING process is a highly reproducible reentrant structure formation controlled by the capillary action during contact between prefabricated microcavity structure and spray‐coated ultraviolet‐curable resins. It demonstrates the superior liquid repellency of the WING structures, which maintain large contact angles even with low‐surface‐tension liquids, and their robust capability to retain solid particles and liquids under external forces. In addition, the scalable and continuous fabrication approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing a cost‐effective and high‐throughput solution for creating multifunctional reentrant surfaces for anti‐icing, biofouling prevention, and particle capture.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel UV‐induced two‐step thiol‐ene “click chemistry” is introduced for the tailorable fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (T‐PQDs). A protective shell is formed around the PQDs in the first step, while chemical cross‐linking between PQD and thiol‐ene polymer occurs in the second step. The T‐PQDs offer high efficiency, stability, and processability, facilitating their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.








Abstract
In practical applications, fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) must exhibit high efficiency, stability, and processibility. So far, it remains a challenge to synthesize PQDs with stable dispersibility in tailorable monomers both before and after photocuring. In this work, a novel strategy of UV‐induced two‐step thiol‐ene “click chemistry” is proposed to prepare PQDs with these attributes. The first step aims to epitaxially grow a shell around the PQD core to ensure stable dispersibility in a thiol‐ene monomer solution. The second step is to achieve stable dispersibility in the photocured thiol‐ene matrixes for multiform manufacturing processes. The tailorable PQDs (T‐PQDs) not only have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to ≈100% for green emission and over 96% for red emission, but also exhibit remarkable stability under severe conditions, including “double 85” aging, water exposure, and mechanical stress. Moreover, their exceptional processability allows for various processing techniques, including slot‐die coating, inkjet printing, direct‐laser writing, UV‐light 3D printing, nanoimprinting, and spin coating. The high efficiency and stability of T‐PQDs facilitate their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.

Abstract
Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. Bio‐based materials present a potentially more sustainable alternative to synthetic polymers; however, it often do not yet match the performance of synthetic materials. Given the ongoing reliance on high‐performance, high‐environmental‐impact materials, it is essential to ensure their complete recyclability. Aerogels, recognized by IUPAC as one of the top ten emerging technologies, are witnessing rapid market growth in thermal insulation and thermal protection applications. In certain applications, synthetic and composite aerogels exhibit superior performance, particularly under high temperatures. Here, molecular simulation tools are employed to elucidate the interaction forces between polymers and solvents, develop a recycling strategy for polyimide‐based aerogels, and demonstrate their application in thermal protection for firefighter textiles and thermal runaway protection for Li‐ion battery packs. These composites are engineered for disassembly, allowing for the complete recovery of starting materials without any degradation of components after multiple recycling cycles. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D). This unique combination of outstanding performance and excellent recyclability facilitates the sustainable utilization of aerogels in protective clothing, electric mobility, consumer goods, and aeronautics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH is developed for on‐skin health monitoring. By integrating multiple sensing mechanisms in a single hydrogel‐coated PDMS optical fiber (HPOF) at distinct wavelengths, the device achieves simultaneous monitoring of heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real‐time with negligible crosstalk.








Abstract
Stretchable sensors that can conformally interface with the skins for wearable and real‐time monitoring of skin deformations, temperature, and sweat biomarkers offer critical insights for early disease prediction and diagnosis. Integration of multiple modalities in a single stretchable sensor to simultaneously detect these stimuli would provide a more comprehensive understanding of human physiology, which, however, has yet to be achieved. Here, this work reports, for the first time, a stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH. The multimodal sensing abilities are enabled by realization of multiple sensing mechanisms in a hydrogel‐coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) optical fiber (HPOF), featured with high flexibility, stretchability, and biocompatibility. The integrated mechanisms are designed to operate at distinct wavelengths to facilitate stimuli decoupling and employ a ratiometric detection strategy for improved robustness and accuracy. To simplify sensor interrogation, spectrally‐resolved multiband emissions are generated upon the excitation of a single‐wavelength laser, utilizing upconversion luminescence (UCL) and radiative energy transfer (RET) processes. As proof of concept, this work demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous monitoring of the heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real‐time, with only a single sensor.

<title>An Adaptive Metal–Organic Framework Discriminates Xylene Isomers by Shape‐Responsive Deformation</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413506?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A shape‐responsive MOF is employed to discern subtle shape differences among xylene isomers. The adsorbent deforms adaptively to match the shapes of isomer molecules, translating these diverse shapes into characteristic deformation energies. With “adaptive fitting” mechanism, where deformation energy scales with the mismatch between molecular shape and pore geometry, the adsorbent energetically favors PX over other isomers, thereby achieving energy‐sieving of xylene isomers.









Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers, especially para‐xylene, is a crucial but challenging process in the chemical industry due to their similar molecular dimensions. Here, a flexible metal–organic framework, Ni(ina)2, (ina = isonicotinic acid) is employed to effectively discriminate xylene isomers. The adsorbent with adaptive deformation accommodates the shapes of isomer molecules, thereby translating their subtle shape differences into characteristic framework deformation energies. Through a combination of multiple local flexibility behaviors, Ni(ina)2 exhibits guest‐specific structural transformations that energetically favor para‐xylene over other isomers. Single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction, in situ powder X‐ray diffraction, and theoretical investigations validate this “adaptive fitting” mechanism, where the degree of structural deformation scales with the mismatch between the molecular shape and pore geometry. As a result, Ni(ina)2 achieves exceptional para‐xylene selectivity in both liquid and vapor phase separations, maintaining a high para‐xylene purity and productivity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy of exploiting framework flexibility to address challenging molecular separations and provides fresh insights into the design of selective adsorbents.

Polymorphing hydrogels can be reshaped on demand by shining light on specific areas. These hydrogels incorporate photo‐reactive DNA cross‐links, whose lengths are reversibly controlled by UV or visible light. Under UV illumination, the cross‐links shorten, causing the hydrogel to contract, while exposure to visible light restores their original length. The image symbolizes this process by depicting a “VIS”ible man and “UV”men working together to sculpt the material.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review examines the critical role of multi‐scale hierarchical structures, from molecular to macro levels, in optimizing light harvesting and photothermal efficiency in solar steam generation (SSG) systems. By tailoring materials and structures to enhance light absorption, manage thermal properties, and support effective water transport, these integrated designs advance solar‐thermal desalination as a sustainable solution to water scarcity.








Abstract
Solar steam generation (SSG) presents a promising approach to addressing the global water crisis. Central to SSG is solar photothermal conversion that requires efficient light harvesting and management. Hierarchical structures with multi‐scale light management are therefore crucial for SSG. At the molecular and sub‐nanoscale levels, materials are fine‐tuned for broadband light absorption. Advancing to the nano‐ and microscale, structures are tailored to enhance light harvesting through internal reflections, scattering, and diverse confinement effects. At the macroscopic level, light capture is optimized through rationally designed device geometries, configurations, and arrangements of solar absorber materials. While the performance of SSG relies on various factors including heat transport, physicochemical interactions at the water/air and material/water interfaces, salt dynamics, etc., efficient light capture and utilization holds a predominant role because sunlight is the sole energy source. This review focuses on the critical, yet often underestimated, role of hierarchical light harvesting/management at different dimensional scales in SSG. By correlating light management with the structure‐property relationships, the recent advances in SSG are discussed, shedding light on the current challenges and possible future trends and opportunities in this domain.

This review sheds light on the most detrimental nanoscopic phase impurities in FA‐rich perovskite PVs and further, highlights research directions that can mitigate their formation in the final films. The objective is to provide fundamental guidelines for engineering state‐of‐the‐art FA‐rich perovskite absorbers pairing exceptional performance and prolonged device stability.








Abstract
Halide‐perovskite semiconductors have a high potential for use in single‐junction and tandem solar cells. Despite their unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for photovoltaic (PV) applications, it remains unclear whether perovskite solar modules can reach a sufficient operational lifetime. In order to make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) commercially viable, a fundamental understanding of the relationship between their nanostructure, optoelectronic properties, device efficiency, and long‐term operational stability/reliability needs to be established. In this review, the phase instabilities in state‐of‐the‐art formamidinium (FA)‐rich perovskite absorbers is discussed. Furthermore, the concerted efforts are summarized in this prospect, covering aspects from fundamental research to device engineering. Subsequently, a critical analysis of the dictating impact of the nanoscale landscape of perovskite materials on their resulting intrinsic stability is provided. Finally, the remaining challenges in the field are assessed and future research directions are proposed for improving the operational lifetimes of perovskite devices. It is believed that these approaches, which bridge nanoscale structural properties to working solar cell devices, will be critical to assessing the realization of a bankable PSC product.

The review explores the potential of Li‐rich Mn‐based (LRM) cathodes in next‐generation lithium‐ion and all‐solid‐state batteries, addressing their challenges, and degradation mechanisms, and proposing strategies for improvement and future research directions.








Abstract
Li‐rich Mn‐based (LRM) cathode materials, characterized by their high specific capacity (>250 mAh g−¹) and cost‐effectiveness, represent promising candidates for next‐generation lithium‐ion batteries. However, their commercial application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and voltage fading, which can be attributed to transition metal migration, lattice oxygen release, and the toxicity of Mn ions to the anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Recently, the application of LRM cathode in all‐solid‐state batteries (ASSBs) has garnered significant interest, as this approach eliminates the liquid electrolyte, thereby suppressing transition metal crosstalk and solid–liquid interfacial side reactions. This review first examines the historical development, crystal structure, and mechanisms underlying the high capacity of LRM cathode materials. It then introduces the current challenges facing LRM cathode and the associated degradation mechanisms and proposes solutions to these issues. Additionally, it summarizes recent research on LRM materials in ASSBs and suggests strategies for improvement. Finally, the review discusses future research directions for LRM cathode materials, including optimized material design, bulk doping, surface coating, developing novel solid electrolytes, and interface engineering. This review aims to provide further insights and new perspectives on applying LRM cathode materials in ASSBs.

This review offers an in‐depth overview of the state‐of‐the‐art advances in the Ru‐based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction to NH3, covering the mechanism, design, and applications. Additionally, the review presents the primary challenges relevant to relatively high cost, complex reaction mechanism, and serious hydrogen evolution, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is widely recognized as a crucial raw material for nitrogen‐based fertilizer production and eco‐friendly hydrogen‐rich fuels. Currently, the Haber–Bosch process still dominates the worldwide industrial NH3 production, which consumes substantial energy and contributes to enormous CO2 emission. As an alternative NH3 synthesis route, electrocatalytic reduction of NOx species (NO3−, NO2−, and NO) to NH3 has gained considerable attention due to its advantages such as flexibility, low power consumption, sustainability, and environmental friendliness. This review timely summarizes an updated and critical survey of mechanism, design, and application of Ru‐based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction. First, the reason why the Ru‐based catalysts are good choice for NOx reduction to NH3 is presented. Second, the reaction mechanism of NOx over Ru‐based materials is succinctly summarized. Third, several typical in situ characterization techniques, theoretical calculations, and kinetics analysis are examined.

This review article systematically explores the recent advances in the membrane processes for lithium cycling and recovery, offering the first correlation between these technologies and technology readiness levels, unveiling the fundamentals for the lithium separation, and providing insights into the future design of membrane materials from both academic and industrial perspectives.








Abstract
Rapid uptake of lithium‐centric technology, e.g., electric vehicles and large‐scale energy storage, is increasing the demand for efficient technologies for lithium extraction from aqueous sources. Among various lithium‐extraction technologies, membrane processes hold great promise due to energy efficiency and flexible operation in a continuous process with potential commercial viability. However, membrane separators face challenges such as the extraction efficiency due to the limited selectivity toward lithium relative to other species. Low selectivity can be ascribed to the uncontrollable selective channels and inefficient exclusion functions. However, recent selectivity enhancements for other membrane applications, such as in gas separation and energy storage, suggest that this may also be possible for lithium extraction. This review article focuses on the innovations in the membrane chemistries based on rational design following separation principles and unveiling the theories behind enhanced selectivity. Furthermore, recent progress in membrane‐based lithium extraction technologies is summarized with the emphasis on inorganic, organic, and composite materials. The challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of selective membranes for lithium recovery are also pointed out.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrical manipulation of spins by spin Hall current from heavy metals facilitates the implementation of multifunctional spintronic devices. This work reports direct evidence of spin current generation in ferromagnets via observation of efficient current‐induced switching of noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet structure. The further realization of field‐free switching suggests the ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources.








Abstract
The ability to electrically manipulate spin states in magnetic materials is essential for the advancement of energy‐efficient spintronic device, which is typically achieved in systems composed of a spin source and a magnetic target, where the magnetic state of the target is altered by a charge current. While theories suggest that ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources, direct experimental studies involving only the spin source and target layers have been lacking. Here electrical manipulation of spin states in noncolinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using ferromagnets (Ni, Fe, NiFe, CoFeB) as the spin sources is reported. Both field‐free switching and switching with an assistive field are achieved in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet bilayers, where the switching polarity correlates with the sign of anomalous Hall effect of the ferromagnets. The experimental findings can be accounted for by the presence of spin currents arising from spin‐dependent scattering within the ferromagnets. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of spin‐conversion in ferromagnets, offering an alternative spin source for novel technological applications.

<title>A Novel Matrix‐Free Hyperfluorescent System Based on Anti‐Quenching TADF Host for High Color Purity MR‐TADF Emitters</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202409746?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study proposes an advanced design concept for matrix‐free hyperfluorescent systems, utilizing anti‐quenching TADF materials as hosts to overcome aggregation‐induced challenges in traditional MR‐TADF emitters by regulating the energy transfer process. Importantly, this strategy avoids complex chemical modifications of MR‐TADF emitters, making them universal and low‐cost, which will greatly promote the commercialization of hyperfluorescent OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on hyperfluorescent system have attracted widespread attention due to their ability to simultaneously achieve improvements in efficiency, lifetime, and color purity by combining the advantages of high exciton utilization sensitizers and high‐color purity emitters. Traditional hyperfluorescent systems typically involve three or four components and are severely sensitive to the doping concentration (≈0.5 wt%) of a terminal emitter, which inevitably causes high costs and difficulties in reproducibility. Here, a novel design concept for a matrix‐free hyperfluorescent (MFHF) system that employs a combination of an anti‐quenching TADF host and a high color purity MR‐TADF emitter is proposed. This strategy allows traditional concentration‐sensitive MR‐TADF emitters to significantly improve exciton utilization and reduce exciton lifetime at high doping levels, without the need for complex molecular modifications. The OLEDs with binary emissive layer achieve pure‐green emission, a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 30%, and a high maximum power efficiency of 145 lm W−1. The approach offers a straightforward and universal method to achieve anti‐quenching matrix‐free hyperfluorescent OLEDs with high color purity, making them promising for commercial applications in low‐cost ultra‐high‐definition (UHD) displays.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high‐capacity and long‐life of Zn‐sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) battery is developed by a tandem catalytic electrolyte containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. The G4–I2 synergy activates efficient I−/I3− redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn‐ion kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic–inorganic interphase that inducing the generation of the predominant (002) plane.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc–sulfur batteries are a high‐capacity and cost‐effective energy storage technology. However, the performance is plagued by the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides formed during conversion. Here, this issue is addressed by developing aqueous rechargeable Zn‐sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries using tandem catalytic systems, containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. Mechanistic study and experiments reveal that the fully conjugated molecular configurations circumvent the formation of soluble polysulfides and enable reversible co‐storage of H+/Zn2+ with multiple redox‐active centers. The reduced I2 by G4 activates I−/I3− redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn‐ion transfer kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic–inorganic interphase that induces the generation of the predominant (002) plane. The as‐assembled Zn‐SPAN batteries exhibit excellent performances, with a high capacity of 1260.4 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1, a high‐rate performance (409.3 mAh g−1 at 5 A g−1), and a long cycling stability (81.8% capacity remained over 800 cycles at 2 A g−1). This work takes a crucial step forward in organosulfur compounds accompanied by multi‐electron transfer for the high‐performance aqueous zinc‐ion batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces AZBX (AZn₂BO₃X₂) as a quasi‐vdW layered dielectric for 2D semiconductor devices, offering a wide bandgap (≈5.6 eV) and high dielectric constant (κ = 13.5). KZBB/MoS₂ FETs demonstrate excellent performance, including steep subthreshold swing, high on/off ratio, minimal hysteresis, and low leakage, highlighting AZBX's potential for advanced 2D electronics.









Abstract
The development of dielectrics with atomic planes and van der Waals (vdW) interfaces is essential for enhancing the performance of 2D devices. However, vdW dielectrics often have smaller bandgaps compared to traditional 3D dielectrics, limiting their options. This study introduces AZBX (AZn₂BO₃X₂, where A = K or Rb, X = Cl or Br), a nonlinear deep‐ultraviolet optical crystal, as a quasi‐vdW layered dielectric ideal for 2D electronic devices. Focusing on KZBB, it's excellent dielectric properties, including a wide bandgap, high dielectric constant (high‐κ), and smooth interfaces are demonstrated. When used as the top gate dielectric in a KZBB/MoS₂ field‐effect transistor (FET) with MoS₂ channels and graphene contacts, the device exhibits outstanding performance, with a steep subthreshold swing (≈ 73 mV dec−1), high on/off ratio (≈ 10⁷), negligible hysteresis (0–8 mV), and stable, low leakage current (≈10⁻⁷ A cm−2) before breakdown. This work expands the 2D material and dielectric landscape and highlights the strong potential of AZBX as high‐performance dielectrics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of α‐amino acids with a high glyoxylic acid conversion of ≈100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2% is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C‐N coupling synthesis of α‐amino acids.








Abstract
The synthesis of α‐amino acids via the electrocatalytic C‐N coupling attracted extensive attention owing to the mild reaction conditions, controllable reaction parameters, and atom economy. However, the α‐amino acid yield remains unsatisfying. Herein, the efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of α‐amino acids is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst (adFe‐TiOx/Ti). The desired electrocatalyst composition for the hydrogenation of oxime is screened. The prepared adFe‐TiOx/Ti exhibited a high glyoxylic acid conversion of ≈100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2%. The electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that atomically dispersed Fe (adFe) sites and oxygen vacancies (OVs) enhanced the adsorption of glyoxylic acid (GA), glyoxylic oxime (GO), and nitrate (NO3−). adFe sites further promote the step of H2NO* → H2NOH* in the conversion of NO3− to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the step of NH‐CH2‐COOH* → NH2‐CH2‐COOH* in the reduction of GO to glycine. The coupling pathway and the critical intermediate are revealed by synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SR‐FTIR) spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Additionally, six other α‐amino acids are successfully synthesized by the adFe‐TiOx/Ti, showcasing its versatility in the electrosynthesis of α‐amino acids. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C‐N coupling synthesis of α‐amino acids.

<title>Conjugation Chemistry Markedly Impacts Toxicity and Biodistribution of Targeted Nanoparticles, Mediated by Complement Activation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Conjugation chemistries are a critical technology in nanomedicine, enabling precise functionalization of nanoparticle surfaces (e.g., via attachment of targeting moieties). This work investigates how conjugation chemistry impacts nanoparticle‐induced complement activation. The results demonstrate that modern conjugation chemistries, although bio‐orthogonal, are not innocuous and must be chosen with opsonins like complement in mind.









Abstract
Conjugation chemistries are a major enabling technology for the development of drug delivery systems, from antibody‐drug conjugates to antibody‐targeted lipid nanoparticles inspired by the success of the COVID‐19 vaccine. However, here it is shown that for antibody‐targeted nanoparticles, the most popular conjugation chemistries directly participate in the activation of the complement cascade of plasma proteins. Their activation of complement leads to large changes in the biodistribution of nanoparticles (up to 140‐fold increased uptake into phagocytes of the lungs) and multiple toxicities, including a 50% drop in platelet count. It is founded that the mechanism of complement activation varies dramatically between different conjugation chemistries. Dibenzocyclooctyne, a commonly used click‐chemistry, caused aggregation of conjugated antibodies, but only on the surface of nanoparticles (not in bulk solution). By contrast, thiol‐maleimide chemistry do not activate complement via its effects on antibodies, but rather because free maleimide bonded to albumin in plasma, and clustered albumin is then attacked by complement. Using these mechanistic insights, solutions are engineered that reduced the activation of complement for each class of conjugation chemistry. These results highlight that while conjugation chemistry is essential for the future of nanomedicine, it is not innocuous and must be designed with opsonins like complement in mind.

<title>Matrix Viscoelasticity Controls Differentiation of Human Blood Vessel Organoids into Arterioles and Promotes Neovascularization in Myocardial Infarction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel method for differentiating arterioles in human blood vessel organoids is presented. Matrix viscoelasticity for hBVO vessel sprouting is manipulated by synthesizing dynamic and non‐dynamic hydrogels. Dynamic hydrogels stimulate angiogenesis in hBVOs, generate unique smooth muscle cells, and facilitate the formation of arterioles that contribute to neovascularization following a myocardial infarction.








Abstract
Stem cell‐derived blood vessel organoids are embedded in extracellular matrices to stimulate vessel sprouting. Although vascular organoids in 3D collagen I‐Matrigel gels are currently available, they are primarily capillaries composed of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and mesenchymal stem‐like cells, which necessitate mature arteriole differentiation for neovascularization. In this context, the hypothesis that matrix viscoelasticity regulates vascular development is investigated in 3D cultures by encapsulating blood vessel organoids within viscoelastic gelatin/β‐CD assembly dynamic hydrogels or methacryloyl gelatin non‐dynamic hydrogels. The vascular organoids within the dynamic hydrogel demonstrate enhanced angiogenesis and differentiation into arterioles containing smooth muscle cells. The dynamic hydrogel mechanical microenvironment promotes vascular patterning and arteriolar differentiation by elevating notch receptor 3 signaling in mesenchymal stem cells and downregulating platelet‐derived growth factor B expression in ECs. Transplantation of vascular organoids in vivo, along with the dynamic hydrogel, leads to the reassembly of arterioles and restoration of cardiac function in infarcted hearts. These findings indicate that the viscoelastic properties of the matrix play a crucial role in controlling the vascular organization and differentiation processes, suggesting an exciting potential for its application in regenerative medicine.

<title>Chiton‐Inspired Composites Synergizing Strength and Toughness Through Sinusoidal Interlocking Interfaces for Protective Applications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The chiton Lepidozona coreanica wisely uses the sinusoidal interlocking interface to make up for the short board of the cross‐lamellar structures. Inspired by this, a chiton‐inspired composite integrating cross‐lamellar architecture and sinusoidal interlocking interface is proposed. The chiton‐inspired composite has the high strength and toughness under quasi‐static and impact loads, and has promising application prospects in the field of protection.








Abstract
Introducing biological structures into materials design is expected to develop strong and tough structural materials. However, multiple interfaces are introduced simultaneously. They are always the weakest part of load transfer, becoming a critical vulnerability and failure‐prone area. Here, it is the first found that the chiton achieves superior mechanical properties just by incorporating a unique sinusoidal interlocking interface into cross‐lamellar architecture. These special interlocking interfaces make the chiton shell achieve damage delocalization and increase the resistance to crack initiation and propagation. Meanwhile, this “pre‐engineered” path significantly increases the travel path of the cracks and balances the strength and toughness under quasi‐static and impact loading. Inspired by this, a novel chiton‐inspired composite is proposed. Through coupling the cross‐lamellar structures and sinusoidal interlocking interfaces, its strength and toughness are increased by 88% and 107% under quasi‐static loading, as well as by 17.8% and 52.4% under impact loading, respectively. These unusual interfaces make up the weak point of cross‐lamellar structures and provide insights into the longer evolution of structural materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The work achieves the polyvalent binding between receptors and ligands through the regulation of ligand density in nano‐system that functioned with precise drug delivery, thereby successfully triggers the lysosome‐targeting protein degradation through endocytosis pathway. Ultimately, the nano‐degrader realizes Alzheimer's disease therapy by modulating the targeted pathological membrane proteins on the damaged blood‐brain barrier.








Abstract
The excessive up‐regulation of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a well‐known pathological marker, drives the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although lysosome‐targeting protein degradation has emerged as an effective therapeutic modality, the limited lysosome‐sorting efficacy greatly hindered the degradation efficiency of target proteins. Herein, a lysosome‐shuttle‐like nano‐chimera (endoTAC) is proposed based on polyvalent receptor binding mode for enhanced RAGE degradation as well as precise drug delivery. The endoTAC shows a high affinity to RAGE and enhances RAGE degradation due to its polyvalent‐interaction with RAGE. Additionally, endoTAC features increased accumulation in diseased brain and shows promise as a precise brain delivery system. After loading with simvastatin, the SV@endoTAC proves to successfully reverse pathological features both in vitro and in vivo. The work proposes that the combination of a lysosome‐targeting chimera and an effective drug delivery system can be promising in Alzheimer's disease therapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The electronic flat bands are conducive to the emergence of strongly interacting phases of matter. In this work, by reducing dimensionality into 1D, it is experimentally constructed ideal flat bands, derived from 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, in two phases of phosphorene nanoribbons with a pentagonal nature, by providing direct evidence via the ARPES measurements and atomically resolved STS mapping.








Abstract
Materials with flat bands can serve as a promising platform to investigate strongly interacting phenomena. However, experimental realization of ideal flat bands is mostly limited to artificial lattices or moiré systems. Here, a general way is reported to construct 1D flat bands in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) with a pentagonal nature: penta‐hexa‐PNRs and penta‐dodeca‐PNRs, wherein the corresponding 1D flat bands are directly verified by using angle‐resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the observed 1D flat bands originate from the electronic 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, respectively, as revealed by the combination of bond‐resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, tight‐binding models, and first‐principles calculations. The study demonstrates a general way to construct 1D flat bands in 1D solid materials system, which provides a robust platform to explore strongly interacting phases of matter.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thermal annealing of the n‐type mixed conductor has a profound effect on its crystallinity, enhancing electronic mobility and decreasing water uptake during electrochemical charging. This new microstructure imparts an “ionic memory” behavior to the material. Leveraging the polymer's sensitivity to light, this work demonstrates the first NIR light‐induced conductance modulation of a mixed conductor in an aqueous electrolyte.








Abstract
N‐type organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (n‐OMIECs) struggle to match the performance of p‐type counterparts, particularly in bioelectronics' flagship device, the organic electrochemical transistor. Enhancing n‐type transistor performance typically necessitates the synthesis of new materials. More sustainable post‐synthetic treatments, known to improve organic devices in dry and oxygen‐free conditions, are not applied to n‐OMIECs. This study introduces thermal annealing to enhance n‐OMIECs' electron mobility without sacrificing their ability to take up ionic charges. Annealing increases the crystallinity of p(gNDI‐gT2), the first designed n‐OMIEC, enhancing its transistor performance to compete with new‐generation NDI‐based materials. Annealing reduces passive and in operando electrolyte uptake without compromising the device threshold voltage, keeping the device power demand low. The microstructure obtained by annealing, combined with the film's strong near‐infrared (NIR) absorption and reduced water swelling, enables the creation of a device that retains photocurrent generated upon frequency‐dependent light training. This leads to a microscale, water‐compatible memory device that emulates the learning process of biological neurons triggered by light. This simple device can be implemented in artificial neural networks and face recognition platforms and achieve vector‐matrix multiplication when fabricated in an array form, showcasing the potential for innovative applications in bioelectronics.

This work proposes a high‐throughput single‐cell exosome quantification and phenotyping platform using a gentle and efficient photothermal‐driven chip. It achieves ≈97% single‐cell isolation efficiency in 5 min, enabling precise exosome analysis of breast cancer cell lines and clinical tissues at the single‐cell level, revealing unique exosome secretion characteristics of subgroups, and providing valuable insights for single‐cell exosome analysis in cancer research.








Abstract
Exosomes, functional biomarkers involved in cancer progression, have gained widespread attention for promoting tumor formation, growth, and metastasis. Current bulk exosome detections in bodily fluids enable cancer functional analysis, but average secretion levels from cell populations, losing parent cell information and ignoring exosome heterogeneity from diverse cell subgroups, necessitating an effective platform for analyzing single‐cell exosome functional heterogeneity. Here, a high‐throughput platform is presented, capable of efficient single‐cell isolation and multi‐color exosome phenotype analysis, as well as quantifying trace exosomes secreted by single cells. Photothermal‐driven single‐cell chips achieve significant single‐cell isolation efficiency (≈97%) within 5 min, facilitating the ultra‐high throughput single‐cell exosome analysis. By conducting mass spectrometry and protein interaction of breast cancer exosome phenotypic proteins, key exosome phenotypes are identified. Tens of thousands of single cells from breast cancer cell lines, and clinical tissues are analyzed, revealing various subgroup differences. The study finds more CD44 and EGFR co‐expressing exosome subgroups in breast cancer cell lines, while immune‐evasion PD‐L1 high‐phenotype exosome subgroups are primarily presented in complex tumor microenvironments, especially in HER2‐positive tissues. This platform offers powerful single‐cell isolation, exosome quantification, and phenotypic analysis capabilities, making it a powerful tool for advancing single‐cell exosome analysis in cancer research.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A stable lead‐free perovskite, dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI), demonstrates exceptional UVC photodetection. The device exhibits ultralow dark current, high on/off ratio, superior detectivity, and low operating voltage. With high responsivity and external quantum efficiency, DMABI emerges as a promising candidate for high‐performance, low‐cost deep UV photodetectors, outperforming existing materials in key performance metrics.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) are essential for various applications, but traditional materials face challenges in cost, fabrication, and performance. This study introduces dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI) as a promising lead‐free perovskite for UV PDs, particularly in the UVC region. DMABI demonstrates exceptional device parameters, including an ultralow dark current of 0.12 pA at 0.05 V, a high on/off ratio of 7.1 × 104, and a peak detectivity of 3.18 × 1013 Jones. The unique structure of DMABI, with isolated octahedral units, ensures minimal connectivity, significantly reducing dark current. When exposed to high‐energy UV light, carriers gain sufficient energy to hop between octahedrally coordinated bismuth centres, resulting in substantial photocurrent. The small size of the organic cation facilitates efficient charge transfer, contributing to high responsivity (1.46 A W−1) and external quantum efficiency (up to 717%). These results establish DMABI as a superior, low‐cost candidate for UV photodetection, addressing limitations of existing materials. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these characteristics and highlights potential for future advancements in UV PD technology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Near‐field thermophotovoltaics promise high output power from low temperature thermal sources, but demonstrating large area devices has proven challenging. Here a novel epitaxial co‐designed emitter‐cell device fabricated with scalable processes demonstrates 1.2 mW from a 460 °C heat source, a greater than 20‐fold enhancement over the far‐field. Modeling of various cell changes offers a pathway to even higher power.








Abstract
Thermophotovoltaics, devices that convert thermal infrared photons to electricity, offer a key pathway for a variety of critical renewable energy technologies including thermal energy storage, waste heat recovery, and direct solar‐thermal power generation. However, conventional far‐field devices struggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near‐field thermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by leveraging photon tunneling effects. Here a large area near‐field thermophotovoltaic device is presented, created with an epitaxial co‐fabrication approach, that consists of a self‐supported 0.28 cm2 emitter‐cell pair with a 150 nm gap. The device generates 1.22 mW at 460 °C, a 25‐fold increase over the same cell measured in a far‐field configuration. Furthermore, the near‐field device demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far‐field photocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of photon tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests several practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in power density. These results highlight the promise of near‐field thermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.

<title>High Defect Tolerance Breaking the Design Limitation of Full‐Spectrum Multimodal Luminescence Materials</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411532?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A grossite‐type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, with a high defect tolerance structure, is used to develop single‐component multimodal luminescence materials. Almost all luminescent modes and full‐spectrum emissions are realized by doping this single host. A series of dynamic anti‐counterfeiting devices and digital information encryption technology with temporal and spatial resolution are proposed to show the visualized optical anti‐counterfeiting application.








Abstract
With the development of optical anti‐counterfeiting and the increasing demand for high‐level information encryption, multimodal luminescence (MML) materials attract much attention. However, the discovery of these multifunctional materials is very accidental, and the versatile host suitable for developing such materials remains unclear. Here, a grossite‐type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, characterized by layered and tunnel structure with excellent defect tolerance, is found to meet the needs of various luminescent processes. Almost all luminescent modes, including down/up‐conversion luminescence (DCL/UCL), long persistent luminescence (LPL), mechanoluminescence (ML), and X‐ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL), are realized in this single host. Full‐spectrum (from violet to near‐infrared) photoluminescence and ML as well as multicolor XEOL are achieved by simply changing the doped luminescent center. A series of anti‐counterfeiting devices, including the quasi‐dynamic display of famous paintings, digital information encryption, and multi‐color handwritten signatures, are designed to show the encryption of information in temporal and spatial dimensions. This study clarifies the importance of defect tolerance of the host for the development of MML materials, and provides a unique insight into the cross‐field applications of special functional materials, which is a new strategy to accelerate the development of novel MML materials.

<title>Low‐Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries Achieved by Synergistically Enhanced Screening Li+ Desolvation Kinetics</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411601?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411601?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
On the basis of pore sieving effect toward Li+ desolvation, the intentionally‐introduced polar electron‐donated chemical groups on metal–organic frameworks is developed to further boost Li+ desolvation and Li0 diffusion kinetics under low temperature, achieving uniform lithium distribution without dendrite formation. As a result, the high capacity‐retention ratio of 97% is stabilized under negative/positive ratio of 3.3 and lower temperature surroundings.








Abstract
Lithium metal anode is desired by high capacity and low potential toward higher energy density than commercial graphite anode. However, the low‐temperature Li metal batteries suffer from dendrite formation and dead Li resulting from uneven Li behaviors of flux with huge desolvation/diffusion barriers, thus leading to short lifespan and safety concern. Herein, differing from electrolyte engineering, a strategy of delocalizing electrons with generating rich active sites to regulate Li+ desolvation/diffusion behaviors are demonstrated via decorating polar chemical groups on porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). As comprehensively indicated by theoretical simulations, electrochemical analysis, in situ spectroscopies, electron microscope, and time‐of‐flight secondary‐ion mass spectrometry, the sieving kinetics of desolvation is not merely relied on pore size morphology but also significantly affected by the ─NH2 polar chemical groups, reducing energy barriers for realizing non‐dendritic and smooth Li metal plating. Consequently, the optimal cells stabilize for long lifespan of 2000 h and higher average Coulombic efficiency, much better than the‐state‐of‐art reports. Under a lower negative/positive ratio of 3.3, the full cells with NH2‐MIL‐125 deliver a high capacity‐retention of 97.0% at 0.33 C even under −20 °C, showing the great potential of this kind of polar groups on boosting Li+ desolvation kinetics at room‐ and low‐temperatures.

<title>Ru‐OV Site‐Mediated Product Selectivity Switch for Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202411813?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Achieving high selectivity in overall CO2 photoreduction is crucial for advancing carbon neutrality and sustainable energy development. This study innovatively establishes dual‐functional active sites comprised of adjacent Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies, stabilizing pivotal intermediates while enhancing local mass transport, thereby achieving the selective overall CO2 photoreduction to CH4.








Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) represents a sustainable route for directly converting greenhouse gases into chemicals but poses a significant challenge in achieving high selectivity due to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations during the reaction process. This work establishes Ru‐OV active sites on the surface of TiO2 by anchoring coordination unsaturated Ru single‐atoms, which stabilize crucial reaction intermediates and facilitate local mass transfer to achieve dual optimization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Combining operando spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicates that oxygen vacancies (OV) inhibits the desorption of *CO, whereas Ru facilitates proton extraction. This configuration not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier but has also been engineered to serve as a selectivity switch, changing the reaction route to produce CH4 instead of CO. Consequently, the Ru‐OV/TiO2 exhibits a 195.4‐fold improvement in the CH4 yield compared to TiO2, accompanied by an increase in selectivity to 81%.

<title>Mechanism of Hot‐Carrier Photoluminescence in Sn‐Based Perovskites</title>

Schematic illustrating the two dominant processes in tin‐iodide perovskites at the band edge: 1) Filling of carriers at the band edge extrema as they cool. 2) Cooling of carriers emitting a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon. The inset shows the dephasing of a longitudinal optical phonon studied by impulsive vibrational spectroscopy in this work.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptionally slow hot‐carrier cooling, which has been attributed to various physical mechanisms without reaching a consensus. Here, experiment and theory are combined to unveil the carrier cooling process in formamidinium (FA) and caesium (Cs) tin triiodide thin films. Through impulsive vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, much shorter phonon dephasing times of the hybrid perovskite, which accounts for the larger blueshift in the photoluminescence seen at high excitation density for FASnI3 compared to CsSnI3 is reported. Density functional theory investigations reveal that the largest contribution to the blueshift is accounted by a giant, dynamic band‐filling effect in Sn‐based perovskites, which in turn can explain the cooling disparity with the Pb‐based counterparts. Several years after the first experimental observations, here a deeper understanding of the cooling mechanism of these materials is provided. Design principles for hot‐carrier materials, which may be useful for future implementations of hot‐carrier solar cells are further provided.

<title>MXene‐Vitrimer Nanocomposites: Photo‐Thermal Repair, Reinforcement, and Conductivity at Low Volume Fractions Through a Percolative Voronoi‐Inspired Microstructure</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study unveils MXene‐vitrimer nanocomposites with a distinct biphasic Voronoi‐inspired microstructure, where a percolative MXene minor‐phase spans throughout a vitrimer major‐phase. Fabricated via a streamlined three‐step process of precipitation polymerization, MXene aqueous coating, and melt‐pressing, these nanocomposites deliver photo‐thermal repairability, mechanical reinforcement, and conductivity at low loadings, achieving greatly diminished percolation thresholds and multifunctionality for advanced smart materials and sustainable composites.








Abstract
An innovative process to multifunctional vitrimer nanocomposites with a percolative MXene minor phase is reported, marking a significant advancement in creating stimuli‐repairable, reinforced, sustainable, and conductive nanocomposites at diminished loadings. This achievement arises from a Voronoi‐inspired biphasic morphological design via a straight‐forward three‐step process involving ambient‐condition precipitation polymerization of micron‐sized prepolymer powders, aqueous powder‐coating with 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tz), and melt‐pressing of MXene‐coated powders into crosslinked films. Due to the formation of MXene‐rich boundaries between thiourethane vitrimer domains in a pervasive low‐volume fraction conductive network, a low percolation threshold (≈0.19 vol.%) and conductive polymeric nanocomposites (≈350 S m−1) are achieved. The embedded MXene skeleton mechanically bolsters the vitrimer at intermediate loadings, enhancing the modulus and toughness by 300% and 50%, respectively, without mechanical detriment compared to the neat vitrimer. The vitrimer's dynamic‐covalent bonds and MXene's photo‐thermal conversion properties enable repair in minutes through short‐term thermal treatments for full macroscopic mechanical restoration or in seconds under 785 nm light for rapid localized surface repair. This versatile fabrication method to nanocoated pre‐vitrimer powders and morphologically complex nanocomposites is compatible with classic composite manufacturing, and when coupled with the material's exceptional properties, holds immense potential for revolutionizing advanced composites and inspiring next‐generation smart materials.

<title>Spatiotemporal Nano‐Regulator Unleashes Anti‐Tumor Immunity by Overcoming Dendritic Cell Tolerance and T Cell Exhaustion in Tumor‐Draining Lymph Nodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces a novel nano‐regulator (DNR) engineered to reprogram dendritic cells (DCs) within tumor‐draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), significantly enhancing anti‐tumor immunity. The DNR employs a dual TLR activation strategy, simultaneously mitigating immune checkpoint suppression. This targeted approach directly addresses DC tolerance and T cell exhaustion, effectively restoring robust anti‐tumor responses.








Abstract
Lymph nodes are crucial immune foci as the primary target for cancer immunotherapy. However, the anti‐tumor functions of tumor‐draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are critically suppressed by tumors. Here, a novel spatiotemporal nano‐regulator is presented, designed to modulate the dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, establishing a supportive niche for immune surveillance. The DC‐mediated nano‐regulator (DNR) is established by the self‐assembly of an imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) prodrug, inhibitory immune checkpoint (ICP) siRNA, and mannan (a TLR4 agonist). This unique design leverages the spatiotemporal activation of TLR4 and TLR7/8, thereby optimizing DC maturation and cytokine production. This further promotes efficient T cell priming. Simultaneously, the ICP‐targeting siRNA mitigates the tolerogenic effects induced by tumor‐derived factors and TLR activation, preventing T cell exhaustion. In essence, DNR facilitates potent remodeling of TDLNs and the tumor microenvironment, activating the anti‐tumor immunity cascade. When combined with vaccines, DNR greatly promotes tumor regression and the establishment of long‐term immunological memory.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is presented, utilizing gold nanoparticle aggregates (AuNAs) with an impressive photothermal efficiency of up to 92.8%. This strategy employs low‐power LED irradiation to achieve complete tumor eradication while enhancing safety and immune responses. The findings indicate that this approach has significant potential for improving cancer treatment outcomes and expanding the applicability of photothermal therapy.








Abstract
For millennia, humans have harnessed thermal energy to treat cancer. However, delivering energy to tumor tissues in traditional hyperthermia remains a significant challenge. Nanotechnology has revolutionized this approach, enabling nanomaterials to target tumors precisely and act as internal heat sources. Nanomaterial‐based photothermal therapy employs nano‐photothermal agents to absorb near‐infrared light and convert it into heat, offering non‐invasive, highly controllable, and specific treatment for solid tumors. Nonetheless, achieving complete tumor eradication, preventing recurrence, and ensuring safety continue to be major concerns. To address these issues, sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is proposed, utilizing gold nanoaggregates (AuNAs) with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (92.8%) in combination with a single irradiation of low‐power (∼0.1 W cm−2) sustained LED light. This method achieved complete tumor eradication in animal models, with no recurrence over long‐term (>180 days) monitoring. This strategy provides superior therapeutic effects compared to mild photothermal therapy and higher safety than high‐temperature photothermal therapy. Additionally, it induces a strong immune response and immune memory, crucial for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This novel approach to photothermal therapy may significantly impact clinical applications for shallow tumor treatment and offer new avenues for immunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Numerous superblacks are fabricated via generally suspending individual light‐absorbing nanoparticles in man‐made solid smoke.








Abstract
Current strategies for constructing sparse nanostructures for fabricating superblacks are only suitable for a few light‐absorbing materials, severely limiting their applications. Herein, ultra‐low reflective silica aerogels with ultra‐high light transparency are used as solid smokes to individually or simultaneously suspend at least 100 species of light‐absorbing nanoparticles with a volume fraction as low as 0.005%, for creating > 100 superblacks in practice and one billion superblacks in theory if taken permutation and combination among these 0D, 1D, or 2D nanoparticles into account. Depending on the composition of suspended nanoparticles and the structure of solid smoke, the resulting mechanically robust superblacks with supplementary properties including magnetism, full‐spectrum absorption, high thermal stability, and excellent mechanical strength, are first observed. The wide choice of metallic or semiconductive LNs allows as‐made superblacks to glitter in different catalytic reactions, and the resulting superblacks have been on‐demand modified for endowing the self‐cleaning performance in some contaminable environments. Benefiting from the superblack feature and porous network, these superblack monoliths have shown high‐efficiency solar‐heat conversion in some emerging light harvesting and managing fields. This powerful synthetic strategy for superblacks is expected to inspire researchers to conduct in‐depth investigations on super‐black optics, functional materials, etc.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Porous ceramics colonized by bacteria can achieve self‐regulated, programmable carbon capture and gas‐sensing functions. The porosity of the ceramic scaffold enables autonomous nutrient transport through capillary forces, enabling microbial growth without external energy. Using wild‐type cyanobacteria and engineered E. coli, living porous ceramics are created to capture CO2 directly from the air and convert toxic gases into human‐detectable benign scents.








Abstract
Microorganisms hosted in abiotic structures have led to engineered living materials that can grow, sense, and adapt in ways that mimic biological systems. Although porous structures should favor colonization by microorganisms, they have not yet been exploited as abiotic scaffolds for the development of living materials. Here, porous ceramics are reported that are colonized by bacteria to form an engineered living material with self‐regulated and genetically programmable carbon capture and gas‐sensing functionalities. The carbon capture capability is achieved using wild‐type photosynthetic cyanobacteria, whereas the gas‐sensing function is generated utilizing genetically engineered E. coli. Hierarchical porous clay is used as a ceramic scaffold and evaluated in terms of bacterial growth, water uptake, and mechanical properties. Using state‐of‐the‐art chemical analysis techniques, the ability of the living porous ceramics are demonstrated to capture CO2 directly from the air and to metabolically turn minute amounts of toxic gas into a benign scent detectable by humans.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The synthesized Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH achieves ultrafast decontamination of nerve and blister agents under ambient conditions with the synergistic effect of Zr4+ and bridging/terminal hydroxyl in the laminates and OH− in the interlayers, remarkably sets the record for the shortest decontamination half‐life for DECP and GD. Further, self‐detoxifying protective fibers are prepared using Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH as a catalytic component.








Abstract
Developing materials capable of rapidly decontaminating nerve and blister agents directly under ambient conditions are crucial for practical applications. In this work, Mg3Al1‐xZrx‐LDH with different Zr4+ doping contents and corresponding OH− intercalated materials Mg3Al1‐xZrx‐LDH‐OH are synthesized. First, they are used for the decontamination of nerve agents under ambient conditions, showing that increasing the Zr4+ doping amount accelerates the decontamination rate of diethyl cyanophosphonate (DECP) and soman (GD), with the half‐life of DECP and GD being 3–5 times shorter with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH (the highest Zr4+ doping content) compared to Mg3Al1‐LDH. Notably, the intercalation of OH− in Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH further greatly enhances the catalytic activity for DECP and GD, the reaction half‐life of DECP and GD with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH being 18 s and <15 s, respectively, which is the shortest recorded so far. Additionally, under ambient conditions, Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH exhibits superior detoxification performance for mustard gas (HD) compared to Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH, with 92.8% of HD being removed within 6 h. Mechanistic studies reveal that Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH efficiently decontaminates nerve and blister agents utilizing the synergistic effect of Lewis acid‐base sites (Zr4+ and laminate OH groups) and interlayer OH−. To extend the practical applications of the materials, PVA@(PAN/LDH‐OH) self‐detoxifying fiber loaded with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4‐LDH‐OH is prepared.

<title>Enhance Photo‐Stability of Up‐Scalable Organic Solar Cells: Suppressing Radical Generation in Polymer Donors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Organic solar cells with a wide thickness range fabricated by doctor‐blade with non‐halogenated solvents in air show strong losses in short‐circuit current density under photo‐thermal stress. Suppressing radical generation in polymer donors processed in air by increasing the crystallinity in unit thickness is critical for enhancing photo‐stability of up‐scalable organic solar cells.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single‐junction organic solar cells (OSCs) has been promoted above 20%. Device up‐scaling draws more and more research attentions. Besides the high PCE for devices with up‐scalable fabrication methods and conditions, achieving high stability simultaneously is essential for pushing industrialization of this technology. Here, the stability of the state‐of‐the‐art OSCs blade‐coated in air with non‐halogenated solvents in a wide thickness range is thoroughly investigated. The losses in short‐circuit current density under photo‐thermal stress strongly depend on processing conditions. Devices with less crystalline phases in unit thickness show faster generation of trap states and hence strongly reduced charge collection efficiency. Through in‐depth photo‐chemical, photo‐physical, and morphological characterizations during ageing, faster generation of radicals in PM6 for active layers with more amorphous structures is identified as the cause for device degradation. Increasing the crystallinity of active layer films for suppressing radical generation in polymer donors is critical to enhance the photo‐thermal stability of devices processed in air with a wide thickness range.

This work describes a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)‐releasing nanocarriers that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds impose significant physical and mental burdens on patients. Nano‐based formulations offer a promising strategy for chronic wound healing due to their non‐invasive nature and enhanced biofilms penetration, but they often lack targeting capability or fail to achieve long‐term and synergistic effects. In this work, a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)‐releasing nanocarriers are presented that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds. With the assistance of MNs, the nanoparticles (NPs) can directly cross bacterial biofilms and be efficiently delivered to wound tissues, where they target harmful bacteria through the specific recognition between Con A and polysaccharides on bacterial surfaces, followed by the release of the encapsulated antimicrobial agent, thereby achieving effective antibacterial effect. Moreover, the NPs generate NO in a sustained manner as they dissociate in the wound tissue, which exerts potent anti‐inflammatory action and benefits tissue regeneration, further promoting chronic wounds closure. Consequently, this work provides a novel MN patch loaded with engineered NPs designed for accelerating chronic wound healing through targeted and synergistic therapy.

<title>Thiol Carbazole Self‐Assembled Monolayers as Tunable Carrier Injecting Interlayers for Organic Transistors and Complementary Circuits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thiol‐based carbazole self‐assembled monolayers are synthesized and used to tune the work function of gold electrodes from 4.52 to 5.48 eV, making them suitable for application as hole or electron injecting contacts in organic thin‐film transistors. Using these thiol‐based monolayers, p/n‐channel organic transistors and complementary inverters are demonstrated.








Abstract
The significant contact resistance at the metal‐semiconductor interface is a well‐documented issue for organic thin‐film transistors (OTFTs) that hinders device and circuit performance. Here, this issue is tackled by developing three new thiol carbazole‐based self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules, namely tBu‐2SCz, 2SCz, and Br‐2SCz, and utilizing them as carrier‐selective injection interlayers. The SAMs alter the work function of gold electrodes by more than 1 eV, making them suitable for use in hole and electron‐transporting OTFTs. Scanning tunneling microscopy analysis indicates that 2SCz and Br‐2SCz form highly ordered molecular rows, resulting in work function values of 4.86 and 5.48 eV, respectively. The latter value is higher than gold electrodes modified by the commonly used pentafluorobenzenethiol (≈5.33 eV), making Br‐2SCz promising for hole injection. Conversely, tBu‐2SCz appears disordered with a lower work function of 4.52 eV, making it more suitable for electron injection. These intriguing properties are leveraged to demonstrate hole‐ and electron‐transporting OTFTs with improved operating characteristics. All‐organic complementary inverters are finally demonstrated by integrating p‐ and n‐channel OTFTs, showcasing the potential of this simple yet powerful contact work function engineering approach.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Quantum‐confined nano scintillators are gaining interest in radiation detection. Understanding the nanoscale scintillation mechanism and key material parameters is crucial. These open questions are addressed by studying the scintillation of CsPbBr3 quantum dots. Increasing the particle size increases the energy deposition, the (multi‐)exciton population, and the emission yield, resulting in maximized scintillation efficiency and timing. A validated theoretical model for the scintillation yield and kinetics is developed, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.








Abstract
The recent emergence of quantum‐confined nanomaterials in the field of radiation detection, in particular lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, offers scalability and performance advantages over conventional materials. This development raises fundamental questions about the mechanism of scintillation itself at the nanoscale and the role of particle size, arguably the most defining parameter of quantum dots. Understanding this is crucial for the design and optimization of future nanotechnology scintillators. In this work, these open questions are addressed by theoretically and experimentally studying the size‐dependent scintillation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and radiometric techniques. The results show that the simultaneous effects of size‐dependent energy deposition, (multi‐)exciton population, and light emission under ionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the scintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to greater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The agreement between theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals without free parameters, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.

<title>A Mitochondrion‐Targeting Piezoelectric Nanosystem for the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction via Autophagy Regulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here, the study proposes a mitochondrion‐targeted piezoelectric nanosystem that can promote mitophagy and ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice through ultrasound‐assisted electric current generation and long‐acting glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) release, respectively. The findings reveal that this nanosystem can be employed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.








Abstract
Mitochondrial damage caused by external stimuli, such as high glucose levels and inflammation, results in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Existing antioxidants can only scavenge ROS and cannot address the root cause of ROS production, namely, abnormal mitochondria. To overcome this limitation, the study develops a piezoelectric synergistic drug‐loaded nanosystem (BaTCG nanosystem) that targets mitochondria. The BaTCG nanosystem is delivered to mitochondria via triphenylphosphine modification, and generates current under the stimulation of ultrasound, thereby promoting mitochondrial autophagy and restoring mitochondrial  homeostasis. In a model of diabetes‐related erectile dysfunction (ED), the BaTCG nanosystem, through the current induced by the piezoelectric effect, not only promoted mitophagy, thereby reducing ROS production, but also released long‐acting glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs) to effectively reduce blood glucose levels and mitochondrial damage. Each component of this nanosystem functions individually as well as synergistically, thus facilitating corpus cavernosum repair and restoring erectile function. In conclusion, the findings offer a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes‐related ED and a target for the treatment of diabetes‐related conditions with functionalized nanoparticles to regulate mitophagy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Functionalized nanozyme microcapsules are established to protect cisplatin‐induced hearing loss via mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed microcapsules reprogram the energy supply mechanism and inhibit the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction, which is the primary mechanism underlying cisplatin‐induced hearing loss, can potentially be mitigated by modulating the redox balance and reprogramming the energy metabolism to remodel mitochondrial homeostasis. Herein, N‐acetyl‐l‐cysteine–derived carbonized polymer dots (NAC CPDs) are embedded into manganese porphyrin–doped metal–organic frameworks and encapsulated using a polydopamine (PDA) coating and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to afford functionalized nanozyme microcapsules. Owing to their injectability and adhesion properties, these microcapsules exhibit the advantages of prolonged retention in the middle ear and sustained release in the inner ear. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed nanozymes activate the PI3K‐AKT pathway, reprogramming the energy supply mechanism, and inhibiting the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c. Therapeutic efficacy and related mechanisms are validated in vivo. Thus, this study on mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling by nanozyme microcapsules opens a new chapter in the treatment of hearing loss.

<title>Xolography for 3D Printing in Microgravity</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413391?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413391?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Xolography can 3D print versatile plastic and hydrogel parts in microgravity and a variety of resins can be processed independent from viscosity and flow properties. Just like on Earth, complex geometries, smooth surfaces and feature resolution down to 20 µm can be achieved during 20 s microgravity phases in a parabolic flight experiment.








Abstract
Xolography is a volumetric 3D printing technique utilizing intersecting light beams within a volume of photopolymer for a spatially controlled photopolymerization. Unlike layer‐based methods, Xolography creates structures continuously within a closed photopolymer vat, eliminating the prevalent need for support structures and allowing full geometrical freedom at high printing speeds. The volumetric working principle does not rely on gravity, making Xolography an outstanding technology for additive manufacturing under microgravity conditions as illustrated in a set of experiments during a parabolic flight campaign. The microgravity environment obviates the need for rheology control of resins, enabling the use of low‐viscosity formulations (e.g., 11 mPa s) while maintaining the fast and precise 3D printing of acrylic polymer resins and hydrogels. Xolography's speed and reliability facilitate rapid iterations of a print task between Earth's gravity and microgravity conditions. This capability positions Xolography as an ideal tool for material research and manufacturing in space, offering significant cost and efficiency advantages over traditional methods.

<title>Self‐Selective (220) Directional Grown Copper Current Collector Design for Cycling‐Stable Anode‐Less Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202413420?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A self‐selective, preferentially Li salt‐adsorbing and inorganic interphase‐catalyzing copper current collector (CuCC) design is developed by incorporating Li salt into CuCC fabrication process to self‐select out its salt‐philic facet growth. This self‐selected Cu(220) facet‐dominant CuCC exhibits high selectivity and catalyzation ability for Li salt adsorption, decomposition, and inorganic interphase formation over other facets, reducing the electrode degradation speed by 33–42%.









Abstract
Anode‐less lithium metal batteries (ALLMB) are promising candidates for energy storage applications owing to high‐energy‐density and safety characteristics. However, the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on anode copper current collector (CuCC) leads to poor reversibility of uneven lithium deposition/stripping. Though the well‐known knowledge of lithium salt‐derived inorganic‐rich SEI (iSEI) benefiting uniform lithium deposition, how to design a lithium salt‐philic CuCC with undiscovered salt‐philic facet that favors lithium salt adsorption and catalyzing salt decomposition into iSEI, remains unexplored yet. Here, a self‐selective and iSEI‐catalyzing CuCC design is developed by using lithium salt as surface‐controlling agent in CuCC electrodeposition process, self‐selecting out and guiding unidirectional Cu(220) facet growth as the most salt‐philic facets of CuCC. This self‐selected Cu(220) facet promotes the salt adsorption and formation of salt decomposition‐derived iSEI in battery, thus improving the lithium plating/stripping coulombic efficiency from 99.25% to 99.50% (stable within 400 cycles), and the capacity decay rate of ALLMB is also reduced by 42.4% within 100 cycles. Practical mass‐productivity of this self‐selective CuCC for 350 Wh kg−1 pouch‐cell fabrication is also demonstrated, providing a new self‐selective current collector design strategy for improving selectivity and catalyzation of desired chemical reaction, important for high‐selectivity electrochemical reaction system construction.

<title>High‐Temperature Diffusion Enabled Epitaxy of the Ti–O System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Thin‐film epitaxy of the Ti–O system at ultra‐high temperatures realizes an unconventional growth mode. Above 1000 °C, oxygen diffusion from the substrates governs the growth dynamics and the resulting growth phase diagram appears to be against basic thermodynamics. The growth temperature selectively stabilizes the oxidation state of the Ti–O system, which demonstrates a novel self‐regulated growth of epitaxial oxides.








Abstract
High temperatures promote kinetic processes that can drive crystal synthesis toward ideal thermodynamic conditions, thereby realizing samples of superior quality. While accessing very high temperatures in thin‐film epitaxy is becoming increasingly accessible through laser‐based heating methods, demonstrations of such utility are still emerging. The study realizes a novel self‐regulated growth mode in the Ti–O system by relying on thermally activated diffusion of oxygen from an oxide substrate. The controlled diffusion enables oxidation state selectivity of single‐phase films with superior crystallinity to conventional approaches as evidenced by structural and electronic measurements. The diffusion‐enabled epitaxy is potentially of wide use in the growth of transition metal oxides, opening up new opportunities for ultra‐high purity epitaxial platforms based on d‐orbital systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 high‐entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles (NPs) are supported in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon farmwork and demonstrated as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction in ammonia synthesis. The multi‐sites of the HEI NPs synergistic for a tandem reduction mechanism, where the Pt‐Fe/Co/Ni/Cu bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key NOx while the Pt sites facilitate the generation of *H species.









Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3
−RR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a significant technological advancement, yet it involves a cascade of elementary reactions alongside various intermediates. Thus, the development of multi‐site catalysts for enhancing NO3
−RR and understanding the associated reaction mechanisms for NH3 synthesis is vital. Herein, a versatile approach is presented to construct platinum based high‐entropy intermetallic (HEI) library for NH3 synthesis. The HEI nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly supported on a 2D nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (N‐mC) framework, featured with adjustable compositions (up to eight elements) and a high degree of atomic order (over 90%). Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and atomic structural analysis, a quinary Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 HEI NPs based N‐mC catalyst is designed, which demonstrates a large ammonia Faradaic efffciency (>97%) and a remarkable recyclability (>20 cycles) under both acidic and basic conditions. The combined in situ experimental analysis and further DFT calculation suggests that the well‐defined multi‐sites nature of the HEI NPs cooperate for a tandem reduction mechanism, in which the Pt‐X (X represents the other four transition elements) bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key nitrogen–oxygen species while the Pt sites facilitate the generation and adsorption of *H species.

<title>Polyphenol Mediated Assembly: Tailored Nano‐Dredger Unblocks Axonal Autophagosomes Retrograde Transport Traffic Jam for Accelerated Alzheimer's Waste Clearance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Customized Nano‐dredger based on the complex interaction between polyphenol Lithospermic acid B (LA) and various substances, including siRNA, lipid nanovacuoles (LIP), ε‐polylysine (εPLL), achieves efficient brain‐neuron targeting, enhances the operability and patency of axonal autophagosome retrograde transport and autolysosomal fusion‐degradation process, thereby decreasing Alzheimer's disease (AD)‐related neuronal waste burden (aberrant accumulated protein/aging organelle) and achieving neuroprotection.








Abstract
Clear‐cut evidence has linked defective autophagy to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies underscore a unique hurdle in AD neuronal autophagy: impaired retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes, potent enough to induce autophagic stress and neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, pertinent therapy is unavailable. Here, a novel combinational therapy composed of siROCK2 and lithospermic acid B (LA) is introduced, tailored to dredge blocked axonal autophagy by multi‐mitigating microtubule disruption, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and autophagy initiation impediments in AD. Leveraging the recent discovery of multi‐interactions between polyphenol LA and siRNA, ε‐Poly‐L‐lysine, and anionic lipid nanovacuoles, LA and siROCK2 are successfully co‐loaded into a fresh nano‐drug delivery system, LIP@PL‐LA/siRC, via a ratio‐flexible and straightforward fabrication process. Further modification with the TPL peptide onto LIP@PL‐LA/siRC creates a brain‐neuron targeted, biocompatible, and pluripotent nanomedicine, named “Nano‐dredger” (T‐LIP@PL‐LA/siRC). Nano‐dredger efficiently accelerates axonal retrograde transport and lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes, thereby facilitating the clearance of neurotoxic proteins, improving neuronal complexity, and alleviating memory defects in 3×Tg‐AD transgenic mice. This study provides a fresh and flexible polyphenol/siRNA co‐delivery paradigm and furnishes conceptual proof that dredging axonal autophagy represents a promising AD therapeutic avenue.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2⁺ diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, conventional Zn0 dendrite growth suppression strategies are shifted by introducing proactive dendrite‐digesting chemistry via an ion sieve interface. This work provides unique insights into achieving reversible aqueous Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Zn0 dendrite formation during repeated plating/stripping processes limits the practical use of Zn‐metal anodes in reliable and affordable energy storage. Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2+ diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, using an in situ pre‐zincation approach, a Li2ZnxTi3‐xO8 (LZTO, 0<3) layer with uniform ion channels is introduced. This layer acts as an ionic sieve, reviving Zn0 dendrite into Zn2+ through redox reactions and enhancing Zn2+ diffusion kinetics. Experiment and simulation results reveal that Zn2+ migrates along the (111) crystal plane of LZTO through the successive replacement of Zn atoms in tetrahedral positions, with a high transference number of 0.796. LZTO@Zn performs better in coin cells at high currents (e.g., 50 mA cm−2) and operates at higher Zn utilization (300 h at 56.98% Zn utilization), with four times the lifespan at −40 °C and six times longer in alkaline electrolytes compared to bare Zn. Pouch cells with LZTO@Zn anodes operate in a low N/P ratio (6.9) and lean electrolyte (E/C is 20 µL mA h−1), achieving enhanced cycling stability. The findings indicate the significance of ion sieves with ordered ion channels in mitigating Zn0 dendrites and promoting rapid Zn2+ transport.

<title>Inverse Size‐Scaling Ferroelectricity in Centrosymmetric Insulating Perovskite Oxide DyScO3</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In centrosymmetric DyScO3, nanoscale thickness gradient‐induced nonpolar‐polar transition is observed by atomically‐resolved electron microscopy. Driven by surface charge transfer, the asymmetric Dy‐Dy split and ferrodistortive octahedral order break the inversion symmetry. The inverse size‐scaling ferroelectricity, prevailing in many perovskites with alternatively charged AOn+ and BO2n− (n ≠ 0) layers, opens up a new era for novel ferroelectric study at low dimension.








Abstract
The breaking of inversion symmetry dictates the emergence of electric polarization, whose topological states in superlattices and bulks have received tremendous attention for their intriguing physics brought for novel device design. However, as for substrate oxides such as LaAlO3, KTaO3, RScO3 (R = rare earth element), their centrosymmetric trivial attributes make their functionality poorly explored. Here, the discovery of nanoscale thickness gradient‐induced nonpolar‐to‐polar phase transition in band insulator DyScO3 is reported by using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. As the free‐standing specimen reduces to a critical thickness ≈5 nm, its inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken by surface charge transfer, which gives rise to asymmetric Dy atomic displacements and ferrodistortive octahedral order, as substantiated by the first‐principles calculations. Apart from the observation of migratable polar vortex structures, the switchable electric polarization by applied electric field is demonstrated by the piezoresponse force microscopy experiments. Given the decisive role of critical size in generating ferroelectricity, a concept of “inverse size‐scaling ferroelectric” is proposed to define a class of such materials. Distinct from the proper and improper ferroelectrics, the findings offer a new platform to explore novel low‐dimensional ferroelectrics and device applications in the future.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel slippery surface is introduced for the enduring separation of viscous water‐in‐oil emulsions through the meticulous construction of a robust, chemically cross‐linked network embedding soft nanomicelles, complemented by the integration of the corrosion‐resistant polystyrene. Ultimately, the coating exhibits outstanding anti‐oil‐adhesion properties (even viscous crude oil), and chemical and mechanical stability, preventing membrane fouling and enabling efficient sustainable high‐viscosity emulsion separation.









Abstract
The demand for efficient separation techniques in industries dealing with high viscosity emulsions has surged due to their widespread applications in various scenarios, including emulsion‐based drug delivery systems, the removal of emulsified impurities in formulations and oil spill remediation. However, membrane fouling is a major challenge for conventional separation methods, leading to decreased efficiency and increased maintenance costs. Herein, a novel approach is reported by constructing liquid‐like surfaces with double anti‐fouling structure, incorporating soft nanomicelles within a rigid, chemically cross‐linked network for both anti‐membrane‐fouling and effective viscous water‐in‐oil emulsion separation. The coating significantly outperforms perfluorinated and commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PVDF) membranes, effectively preventing the adhesion of viscous oils like crude oil and pump oil, and alleviating severe membrane fouling. For high‐viscosity emulsions (97.3 cP and 52.8 cP), it maintains over 99% separation efficiency after 3 h continuous use. Even after 15 h immersion in strong acids, alkalis, salts, or organic solvents, its separation efficiency remains above 95%. In addition, thanks to the anti‐membrane‐fouling ability, this work achieved 6 h continuous emulsion separation performance for the first time, demonstrating unparalleled long‐term stability. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the development of innovative coatings for efficient and eco‐friendly separation of high‐viscosity emulsions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An effective and universal strategy for constructing hybrid materials with sign‐switchable Poisson's ratio is developed, enabling the material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. Upon integrating a pre‐stretched silver nanowires film onto its surface, the device can switch its strain‐resistance response between strain‐insensitive and strain‐dependent states due to the varying deformation characteristics.








Abstract
Stretchable electronic devices that conduct strain‐related electronic performances have drawn extensive attention, functioning as mechanical sensors, actuators, and stretchable conductors. Although strain‐insensitive or strain‐responsive nature is well‐achieved separately, it remains challenging to combine these two characteristics in one single device, which will offer versatile adaptability in various working situations. Herein, a hybrid material with sign‐switchable Poisson's ratio (SSPR) is developed by combining a phase‐change gel based reentrantreentrant honeycomb pattern and a polydimethylsiloxane film. The phase‐change gel featuring thermally‐regulated Young's modulus enables the hybrid material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. After integrating with a pre‐stretched silver nanowires film, the obtained stretchable device performs bimodal strain‐to‐electrical signal transducing (Bi‐SET) functions, in which the SSPR‐dominated strain‐resistance response switches between strain‐dependent and strain‐insensitive behaviors. As a proof of concept, a mode‐switchable grasping system is constructed using a Bi‐SET device‐based controller, enabling the adaptation of grasping behaviors to various target objects.

Optically pumped and electrically Q‐switchable minute laser oscillators are invented. The oscillator is made from a robust self‐standing organic droplet that deforms into a prolate spheroid under an electric field. The deformation induces the attenuation of the quality factor, leading to a halt of the laser emission. An array of droplet lasers is also demonstrated as a prototype laser display.








Abstract
Conventional laser panel displays are developed through the mass integration of electrically pumped lasers or through the incorporation of a beam steering system with an array of optically pumped lasers. Here a novel configuration of a laser panel display consisting of a non‐steered pumping beam and an array of electrically Q‐switchable lasers is reported. The laser oscillator consists of a robust, self‐standing, and deformable minute droplet that emits laser through Whispering‐Gallery Mode resonance when optically pumped. The laser oscillation is electrically switchable during optical pumping by applying a vertical electric field to the droplet. Electromagnetic and fluid dynamics simulations reveal the deformation of the droplet into a prolate spheroid under the electric field and associated attenuation of quality factor (Q‐factor), leading to the halt of the laser oscillation. A 2 × 3 array of droplets is fabricated by inkjet printing as a prototype of a laser panel display, and it successfully achieves the pixel‐selective switching of the oscillation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The full‐color QD lasers relevant for practical implementations are achieved. These QD lasers feature the simultaneous metrics of low threshold, long operating duration, and multimilliwatt output power under quasi‐steady‐state pumping. To the best of the available knowledge, the multimilliwatt output power has never been realized in QD lasers before. These results open the door to practical QD lasers.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are attractive gain materials owing to the wide range of accessible colors. However, the existing QD lasers struggle to combine technologically relevant metrics of low threshold and long operating duration with considerable output powers. Here a new class of full‐color QD lasers are reported, featuring low threshold, uninterrupted operation for dozens of hours, and multimilliwatt output under quasi‐steady‐state pumping, by coupling the high‐gain QDs with a double‐clad pumping scheme. Corroborated by the comprehensive transient spectroscopy and numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the ternary QDs with specially designed fine nanostructure enable the low gain threshold, giant gain coefficient, long gain lifetime, and excellent resistance against intense photoexcitation. Meanwhile, the double‐clad QD‐fiber design allows for record‐long light‐gain interaction, high conversion efficiency, and sustained device operation. As such, the QD lasers with multimilliwatt output powers, unobserved in QD lasers to date, have been realized. Further, the proof‐of‐concept application for generating vortex beams with various topological charges is demonstrated. This work represents significant progress toward practical lasers based on QDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hot carrier devices with low‐dimensional semiconductor heterostructures are promising for enhancing photon‐to‐current conversion beyond the Shockley‐Queisser limit. This study presents a 2D Van der Waals heterostructure device made of 2D perovskite quantum wells and few‐layer MoS₂. The device shows efficient gate‐tunable hot‐hole photocurrent and high external quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Hot‐carrier relaxation above the bandgap results in significant energy losses, making the extraction of hot carriers a critical challenge for efficient hot‐carrier photocurrent generation in devices. In this study, we observe long‐lived hot carriers in the metal‐halide perovskite multiple quantum wells, (BA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3), and demonstrate effective hot‐hole photocurrent generation using 2D MoS₂ as an extraction layer. A high external quantum efficiency of short‐circuit hot‐carrier photocurrent of up to 35.4% is achieved. Further enhancement in photocurrent efficiency and open‐circuit photovoltage is achieved when a gate electric field is applied, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of up to 61.9%. Evidence of hot‐hole extraction is validated through operando transient reflection measurements on the working devices, with studies that depend on wavelength, carrier density, and gate voltage. DFT calculations on the heterostructure devices under different bias voltages further elucidate the mechanism of hot‐hole extraction enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of perovskite multiple quantum wells as long‐lived hot‐carrier generators and highlight the role of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors as efficient hot‐carrier extraction electrodes for low‐power optoelectronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D Cs2Bi3X9 (X = Br, Cl, I) perovskite crystals with variable lattice constants and engineered bandgaps are synthesized via adaptive heteroepitaxy on c‐sapphire substrates. Photodetectors based on these epitaxial crystals exhibit significantly improved photodetection performance, indicating the effectiveness of epitaxial growth strategy for high‐quality crystals. This work advances the integration of multicomponent 2D materials on dielectric substrates for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The heteroepitaxy of 2D materials with engineered bandgaps are crucial to broaden the spectral response for their integrated optoelectronic devices. However, it is a challenge to achieve the high‐oriented epitaxy and integration of multicomponent 2D materials with varying lattice constants on the same substrate due to the limitation of lattice matching. Here, in‐plane adaptive heteroepitaxy of a series of high‐oriented 2D cesium bismuth halide (Cs3Bi2X9, X = I, Br, Cl) single crystals with varying lattice constants from 8.41 to 7.71 Å is achieved on c‐plane sapphire with distinct lattice constant of 4.76 Å at a low temperature of 160 °C in an air ambient, benefiting from tolerable interfacial strain by switching compressive stress to tensile stress during a 30° rotation of crystal orientation. First‐principles calculation demonstrates that those are all thermodynamically stable phases, deriving from multiple minima of interfacial energy between single crystals and sapphire substrate. The detectivity of Cs3Bi2I9 photodetector reaches up to 3.7 × 1012 Jones, deriving from high single‐crystal quality. This work provides a promising experimental strategy and basic theory to boost the heteroepitaxy and integration of 2D single crystals with varying lattice constants on low‐cost dielectric substrate, paving the way for their applications in integrated optoelectronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel exchange‐spring magnetic structure is formed by the coupling of perpendicular CoTb and in‐plane Co films. When a spin current with the y‐polarization flows through this exchange‐spring (x‐z plane) structure, the interaction between the y‐spin and the local exchange field gives rise to unconventional x‐ and z‐ spin polarizations, enabling field‐free spin‐orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching.








Abstract
Manipulating the polarization of spin current is essential for understanding the mechanism of charge‐to‐spin conversion and achieving efficient electrically driven magnetization switching. Here, a novel exchange‐spring magnetic structure is introduced formed by the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) CoTb and in‐plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) Co films. When a spin current with the polarization along the y‐direction flows through this exchange‐spring (x‐z plane) structure, the interaction between the y‐spin and the local exchange field with a non‐collinear spatial distribution gives rise to substantial unconventional spin polarizations in the x‐ and z‐directions, enabling field‐free spin‐orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching at room temperature. More importantly, the polarization directions of this unconventional spin current can be reversed depending on whether the interfacial exchange coupling is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. This work establishes a platform to explore emergent mechanisms for manipulating unconventional spin polarization with rich non‐collinear magnetic exchange spin structures.

<title>Efficient Targeted Regulation of the Interfaces and Bulk in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells With a [closo‐B12H12]2−‐based Derivative</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Post‐treatment involving the incorporation of a novel solution‐processable [closo‐B12H12]2‐ derivative, (TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B), is proposed to simultaneously optimize the interfaces and bulk of inverted perovskite solar cells. TBA2B enhances the power conversion efficiency to 25.59% while improving the stability, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of efficient [closo‐B12H12]2‐‐based interface materials and modification mechanisms.








Abstract
The performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is adversely affected by the recombination loss, ion migration, and residual stress arising from issues within the bulk and at the cathode interface. Using simple post‐treatment with a novel solution‐processable derivative of the dodecahydro‐closo‐dodecaborate anion ([closo‐B12H12]2−)—(TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B)—it is simultaneously address these issues. In inverted PSCs, the cationic and anionic components of TBA2B uniquely self‐separate by positioning themselves precisely to perform their specific modification functions. The majority of [B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH]2‐ anions reside at the (6,6)‐phenyl‐C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag interface, which enhances the electrical and physical contact. Additionally, a substantial fraction of tetrabutylammonium cations diffuse into the perovskite/PCBM heterojunction, enabling comprehensive control over the trap passivation, stress release, ion migration elimination, and grain boundary reinforcement through the in situ formation of 1D TBAPbI3 on the surface of the perovskite crystals. The TBA2B devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 25.59% and open‐circuit voltage of 1.199 V, performance that is among the highest achieved with a solution‐processed perovskite/PCBM heterojunction. Furthermore, TBA2B significantly enhances the device's stability. This study provides crucial insights into the design of efficient and solution processable [closo‐B12H12]2−‐based interface materials, and offers a comprehensive understanding of the underlying modification mechanisms.

<title>Interfacial Metal‐Solvent Chelation for Direct Regeneration of LiFePO4 Cathode Black Mass</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414235?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414235?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To address interfacial challenges in spent LiFePO4 (LFP) black mass, such as structural deterioration and residual impurities, a metal‐solvent chelation strategy leveraging the strong chelation of the Acac− anion is presented. This approach enables effective spent LFP regeneration by surface reconstruction of the degraded LFP with reducing lithium diffusion barriers and enhancing lithium supplementation.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium‐ion batteries presents a promising approach to effectively reuse valuable resources and benefit the environment. Unlike controlled laboratory conditions that commonly facilitate impurity purification and minimize structural damage, the LiFePO4 cathode black mass faces significant interfacial challenges, including structure deterioration, cathode‐electrolyte interphase residues, and damage from storage procedures, which hinder lithium replenishment and structure regeneration. Here, a metal‐solvent chelation reaction using a lithium acetylacetonate solution is introduced to address these challenges under ambient conditions. This method regulates the near‐surface structure through strong chelation between Acac‒ anions and Fe (III) elements, thus effectively eliminating the degraded amorphous phase and residual fluorine compounds. By direct lithium connection and reducing diffusion barriers, the reconstructed surface facilitates the re‐lithiation process. The regenerated LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a capacity retention of 88.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C, while also outperforming traditional recycling methods in terms of environmental and economic benefits. This approach provides a promising solution for regenerating degraded LiFePO4 cathodes from actual dismantled black mass, thereby accelerating the practical application of battery recycling.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Photo‐reactive DNA‐cross‐linked hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo‐reactive DNA crosslinks act as a regulator in morphing of the hydrogels, adjusting the lengths of the cross‐links depending on the wavelength of light. Spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features of the polymorphing hydrogels within a one‐pot system offer advanced solutions for applications in soft robotics and 4D printing.








Abstract
Polymorphing hydrogels can morph into another structure on demand with reprogrammable features. This concept extends the degree of morphing beyond that of traditional shape‐morphing hydrogels, which predetermine their morphing capabilities at the fabrication stage. However, current polymorphing hydrogels face limitations due to the need for complex, non‐sustained responsiveness or additional chemical steps for reconfigurable morphing. Here, photo‐reactive DNA‐cross‐linked polymorphing hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo‐reactive DNA cross‐links act as a regulator in changing the shapes of the hydrogels by adjusting the lengths of the cross‐links depending on the wavelength of light, which allows precise and dynamic morphing in a programmable way through a one‐pot reaction. The high programmability involving spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features offers advanced solutions for multifunctional soft machines and applications requiring complex processes.

Abstract
As the focus on information security continues to intensify, encrypted imaging sensing technology becomes increasingly indispensable. However, the widespread application of encrypted imaging sensing technology is hindered by high manufacturing costs and complex system construction. Herein, an all‐inorganic perovskite/perovskite tandem self‐powered photodetector (PDs) is reported, incorporated with Bi2TeO6 layer to enahnce dual pyro‐phototronic effect, to realize an innovated encryption imaging sensing system with programmable logic gate. The PDs reach responsivity of 1.46 A W−1 and detectivity of 3.44 × 1013 Jones, the corresponding EQE reaches 342%, which is ≈75.48 times greater than that without pyro‐phototronic effect. The outstanding performance resulting from dual pyro‐phototronic effect in Cs2PbI2Cl2 perovskite and Bi2TeO6/CsSn0.5Pb0.5IBr2 interface, and optimizing band arrangement from the oxidized Bi2TeO6 layer. The photovoltaic and pyro‐phototronic signal of PDs can still be clearly distinguished under 8 kHz pulsed laser. More importantly, the encryption imaging sensing system achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate can execute six distinct logical functions, including “OR”, “AND”, “XOR”, “NAND”, “NOR” and “XNOR”. This research not only provides a feasible strategy for realizing the outstanding pyro‐phototronic effect of all‐inorganic perovskite materials, but also presents novel insights for designing encrypted imaging sensing technology.

The Co3O4 nanoparticles are invited to anchor on Fe1‐NC. It is found the spin state of Fe and Co is effectively modulated. Thereby, a boosted ORR and OER performance is achieved for Co3O4@Fe1‐NC proved by 163.1 mW cm−2 in the all‐solid‐state ZAB test.








Abstract
High‐performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the keystone for the industrialization of rechargeable zinc‐air battery (ZAB). In this work, the modulation in the spin state of Fe single atom on nitrogen doped carbon (Fe1‐NC) is devised by Co3O4 (Co3O4@Fe1‐NC), and a mediate spin state is recorded. Besides, the d band center of Fe is downshifted associated with the increment in eg filling revealing the weakened interaction with OH* moiety, resulting in a boosted ORR performance. The ORR kinetic current density of Co3O4@Fe1‐NC is 2.0‐ and 5.6 times higher than Fe1‐NC and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, high spin state is found for Co in Co3O4@Fe1‐NC contributing to the accelerated surface reconstruction of Co3O4 witnessed by operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. A robust OER activity with overpotential of 352 mV at 50 mA cm−2 is achieved, decreased by 18 and 60 mV by comparison with Co3O4@NC and IrO2. The operando Raman reveals a balanced adsorption of OH* species and its deprotonation leading to robust stability. The ZAB performance of Co3O4@Fe1‐NC is 193.2 mW cm−2 and maintains for 200 h. Furthermore, the all‐solid‐state ZAB shows a promising battery performance of 163.1 mW cm−2.

A composition‐graded ferroelectric ScAlN multi‐level memory is demonstrated, showing a storage capacity up to 7‐bit, and one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced operating voltage tuning window compared to uniform composition devices. This approach paves the way for advanced integration of wurtzite ferroelectrics in multifunctional computing systems.








Abstract
Multi‐level non‐volatile ferroelectric memories are emerging as promising candidates for data storage and neuromorphic computing applications, due to the enhancement of storage density and the reduction of energy and space consumption. Traditional multi‐level operations are achieved by utilizing intermediary polarization states, which exhibit an unpredictable ferroelectric domain switching nature, leading to unstable multi‐level memory. In this study, a unique approach of composition‐graded ferroelectric ScAlN to achieve tunable operating voltage in a wide range and attain precise control of domain switching and stable multi‐level memory is proposed. This non‐volatile memory supports multi‐level storage up to 7‐bit capacities, and exhibits enhanced performance compared to the uniform composition device, showing one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced tuning window of operating voltage. Finally, the emulation of long‐term plasticity and linear weight update akin to biological synapse with high uniformity and reliability are demonstrated. The proposed composition‐grading architecture offers new opportunities for next‐generation multi‐level ferroelectric memories, paving the way for advanced hybrid integration in multifunctional computing systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study designes a gradient crown on the side facets of CdSe nanoplatelets to address the issue of high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures. Consequently, a gradient alloyed shell is successfully grown, and the core/crown/shell nanoplatelets exhibited near‐unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high stability. Therefore, the prepared nanoplatelets light‐emitting diodes demonstrates a record‐high external quantum efficiency of 30.1%.








Abstract
Anisotropic nanoplatelets (NPLs) possess strong in‐plane transition dipole moments and out‐of‐plane emission, which enable a maximum photon out‐coupling efficiency of 40% and a high gain coefficient, making them ideal candidates for light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the unbalanced surface energy between the side and top facets of NPLs results in poor thermal stability and high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures, which complicates the growth of the shell. To address this issue, a gradient crown (CdSeS) around the CdSe NPLs is designed to stabilize the high energy side facets. Consequently, the gradient alloyed shell (CdZnS) is successfully grown, and the CdSe/CdSeS/CdZnS core/crown/shell NPLs exhibited near‐unity photoluminescence quantum yield. The CdSeS/CdZnS crown/shell structure suppressed non‐radiative Auger recombinations, achieving a record‐low amplification spontaneous emission threshold of 2.11 µJ cm−2 under femtosecond laser excitation. In addition, by selecting the carrier transport layers with matched energy levels, the NPL‐LEDs demonstrate a record‐high external quantum efficiency of 30.1% in the pure‐red range, driven by the 94% in‐plane transition dipole moment distribution of NPL film. The NPL‐LEDs also exhibited a long operational lifetime of T95 > 600 h at a luminance of 1000 cd m−2.

A self‐floating plasmonic sponge that harvests full‐solar‐spectrum light for highly efficient water purification.








Abstract
Solving the global challenge of freshwater scarcity is of great significance for over one billion people in the world. Solar water evaporation based on plasmonic nanostructures is one of the most promising technologies due to its high efficiency. However, the efficiency of this plasmonic nanostructure‐based technology can hardly achieve 100%. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop new solar converters utilizing plasmonic local heating and reasonable structure design to break the limit of solar‐to‐vapor efficiency for freshwater production. Here, a plasmonic sponge is developed as a solar evaporation converter with excellent full‐solar‐spectrum absorption, good heat localization performance, and fast evaporation kinetics through 3D nanostructures, achieving a 131% solar‐to‐vapor efficiency. Distinct from the traditional 2D localized heating‐based evaporation and nonmetallic 3D water evaporation, the 3D plasmonic sponge can simultaneously achieve highly efficient local heating and super large water–air interfaces for boosting solar‐to‐vapor efficiency. The 3D plasmonic sponge can be also used as a universal converter for purifying seawater, metal ion solutions, organic pollutant solutions, and strong acid and strong alkaline solutions. The full‐solar‐spectrum absorption, high efficiency, and universality in water purification suggest that the novel 3D plasmonic solar converter can bring a significant way to alleviate the crisis of freshwater resources.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Optoelectronic devices integrating visual imaging and recognition functions are achieved by employing 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunction. Through switching bias to modulate carrier and oxygen vacancy dynamics, the device exhibits photodetection property at zero bias and photosynaptic property at negative bias. This work provides a novel strategy to achieve low‐power consumption, easy‐switchable and functional integrated optoelectronic devices for artificial visual system.








Abstract
Optoelectronic devices with imaging and recognition capabilities are crucial for developing artificial visual system (AVS). Bias‐switchable photodetection and photosynaptic devices have been developed using 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunctions. This unique structure allows for modulated carrier dynamics under varied bias conditions, enabling the devices to function as photodetectors without bias and as photosynapses with bias. At zero bias, the device achieves high responsivity (≈0.36 A W−1 at 320 nm) and rapid response speed (0.57 s). Under a −0.5 V bias, it exhibits persistent photoconductivity (PPC), resulting in neuromorphic synaptic behaviors with a paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) index exceeding 300%. Moreover, an 8 × 8 sensor array demonstrates image sensing and memory capabilities, showing in situ enhanced imaging when switching the bias from 0 to −0.5 V, and over 200 s of image memory. The image processing and recognition abilities are further explored by constructing an AVS using a 28 × 28 device array combined with an artificial neural network (ANN). The adjustable synaptic weight under different reverse biases allowed for optimized simulated recognition, achieving an accuracy of 92% after 160 training epochs. This work presents a novel method for creating dual‐functional photodetection and photosynaptic devices, paving the way for a more integrated and efficient AVS.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, B2O3 coating layer is used as a flux for Sb2Se3 recrystallization, inducing a vertical orientation growth of the film while suppressing the defect of Se vacancies. The orientation control and passivation of defects enables efficient transport of carriers, resulting in the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.








Abstract
Crystallization process is critical for enhancing the crystallinity, regulating the crystal orientation of polycrystalline thin films, as well as repairing defects within the films. For quasi‐1D Sb2Se3 photovoltaic materials, the preparation of Sb2Se3 thin films still faces great challenges in adjusting orientation and defect properties, which limits the device performance. In this study, a novel post‐treatment strategy is developed that uses a low melting point B2O3 coating layer as a flux to drive the recrystallization of Sb2Se3, thereby regulating the micro‐orientation of thermal evaporation‐derived Sb2Se3 films and optimizing their electrical properties. Mechanistic investigations show that B2O3 exhibits stronger adsorption with (hk1) planes of Sb2Se3 to induce a vertical orientation growth of the film, while blocking the volatilization channels of Se and inhibiting Se vacancy defects by interacting with Sb2Se3. The Sb2Se3 film with [hk1] preferential orientation and suppressed deep‐level defects promotes the effective transport of charge carriers in solar cells. As a result, the B2O3‐treated device delivers a champion efficiency of 9.37% without MgF2 anti‐reflection coating, which is currently the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells achieved by thermal evaporation method. This study provides a new method and mechanism for regulating optical and electrical properties of low‐dimensional inorganic thin films.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An efficient laser‐assisted regeneration process is developed to convert spent LiMn2O4 cathodes into performance‐enhanced, Ni‐doped cathodes. Surface Ni doping enhances interfacial processes and prevents capacity loss at lower temperatures by forming a new interface with a reduced charge transfer energy barrier. This innovative approach offers a sustainable solution for regenerating spent lithium‐ion battery cathodes.








Abstract
The rapid increase in lithium‐ion battery (LIB) production, fueled by the rise of electric vehicles, highlights significant challenges in managing end‐of‐life LIBs, particularly regarding environmental impact and waste management. Traditional recycling methods, such as pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, are energy‐intensive and consume substantial reagents. In this study, a laser‐assisted regeneration method is introduced for LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathodes, enabling in situ Ni doping into spent LMO cathodes (r‐LMO‐Ni) to enhance electrochemical performance. Surface Ni‐doping improves interfacial processes and reduces capacity loss at lower temperatures by creating a new interface with a lower charge transfer energy barrier. The r‐LMO‐Ni cathode surpasses pristine LMO cathodes, achieving a specific capacity of 112.95 mA h g−1 at 1 C and retaining 95.1% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0 °C. A techno‐economic analysis supports the feasibility of this laser‐assisted regeneration approach, offering an innovative pathway for upcycling spent cathodes and developing next‐generation Mn‐based cathodes.

Highly anisotropic 2D insulator CrOCl nanosheets are synthesized via space‐confined chemical vapor deposition growth. A MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single‐mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, which endows its device with polarization‐sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect. This study opens new prospects for exploring CrOCl‐based physics and electronics via symmetry engineering.









Abstract
Chromium oxychloride (CrOCl), a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator, has attracted significant interest in 2D optoelectronic, ferromagnetic, and quantum devices. However, the bottom–up preparation of 2D CrOCl remains challenging, limiting its property exploration and device application. Herein, the controllable synthesis of 2D CrOCl crystals by chemical vapor deposition is demonstrated. The combination reaction of precursors together with the space‐confined growth strategy, providing stable and stoichiometric growth conditions, enable a robust synthesis of high‐crystallinity CrOCl nanosheets with regular rhombus‐like morphology and uniform thickness. By tuning the growth temperature from 675 to 800 °C, the thickness of CrOCl nanosheets can be continuously modulated from 10.2 to 30.8 nm, with the domain size increasing from 16.9 to 25.5 µm. The as‐grown CrOCl nanosheets exhibit significant structural/optical anisotropy, ultrahigh insulativity, and superior air stability. Furthermore, a MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single‐mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, a novel interface phenomenon that converts MoS2 from isotropy to anisotropy. Consequently, the MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure device achieves polarization‐sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect, which are nonexistent in high‐symmetry 2D materials. This work paves the way for the future exploration of CrOCl‐based 2D physics and devices via symmetry engineering.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor integrates real‐time, dynamically reversible potassium ion (K⁺) fluorescence imaging (FI) with high‐resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This enables electroencephalogram‐concordant imaging of hidden epileptic foci and guides minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation on mice with drug‐resistant focal epilepsy, resulting in sustained seizure control and improved cognitive outcomes.









Abstract
Surgery remains an essential treatment for managing drug‐resistant focal epilepsy, but its accessibility and efficacy are limited in patients without distinct structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Potassium ion (K+), a critical marker for seizure‐associated neuronal signaling, shows significant promise for designing sensors targeting hidden epileptic foci. However, existing sensors cannot cross the blood‐brain barrier and lack the ability to specifically enrich and amplify K+ signals in the brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, an intravenously administered neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor (NSAN) is reported that combines real‐time dynamic reversible K+ fluorescence imaging with high‐resolution structural MRI, enabling electroencephalogram‐concordant imaging of MRI‐negative epileptic foci. Guided by NSANs, minimally invasive surgery is successfully performed in both intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) epilepsy model with foci confined to the ipsilateral hippocampus, and intraperitoneal KA model where foci are randomly distributed, resulting in sustained seizure control and cognitive improvement. These findings highlight the NSAN as a transformative tool for visualizing hidden epileptic foci, thereby broadening eligibility for minimally invasive and precision surgical intervention.

<title>Synergistic Multimodal Energy Dissipation Enhances Certified Efficiency of Flexible Organic Photovoltaics beyond 19%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By combining multimodal energy dissipation and phase modulation in active layer films, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible electronics are innovatively co‐developed to achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.07%, which is the highest PCE reported for flexible organic photovoltaic device to date.








Abstract
All‐polymer organic solar cells (OSCs) have shown unparalleled application potential in the field of flexible wearable electronics in recent years due to the excellent mechanical and photovoltaic properties. However, the small molecule acceptors after polymerization in still retain some mechanical and aggregation properties of the small molecule, falling short of the ductility requirements for flexible devices. Here, based on the multimodal energy dissipation theory, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible devices are co‐enhanced by adding the thermoplastic elastomer material (polyurethane, PU) to the PM6:PBQx‐TF:PY‐IT‐based active layer films. The construction of multi‐fiber network structure and the decrease of films’ residual stresses contribute to the enhancement of carrier transport properties and the decrease of defect state density. Eventually, the PCE (power conversion efficiency) of 19.40% is achieved on the flexible devices with an effective area of 0.102 cm2, and the third‐party certified PCE reaches 19.07%, which is the highest PCE for flexible OSCs currently available. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large‐area module applications, the 25‐cm2‐based flexible and super‐flexible modules are prepared with the PCEs of 15.48% and 14.61%, respectively, and demonstration applications are implemented.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new BD2FCT material is developed as an advanced HTL tailored for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells through precise molecular engineering. This new polymer effectively reduces charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces, thereby leading to enhanced charge extraction. Incorporation of the IEICO‐4F into BD2FCT further improves charge funneling and absorption, resulting in a notable 10.1% PCE for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells.








Abstract
Silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) colloidal nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as ecofriendly photoactive materials with excellent photoconductivity and high absorption coefficients, in compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) guidelines. To maximize the theoretical potential of AgBiS2 CNC solar cells, a new diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)‐based polymer, BD2FCT, optimized as a hole transport layer (HTL), is developed. This asymmetric thiophene‐rich polymer HTL effectively complements the optical absorption spectrum of CNCs and forms a homogeneous layer atop the CNCs, facilitating favorable vertical charge transfer through intrinsic molecular packing. Furthermore, the BD2FCT HTL aligns energetically with AgBiS2, significantly reducing charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces and enhancing charge extraction and photocurrent generation across the entire optical absorption spectrum. These characteristics are further optimized through precise molecular engineering. Additionally, a low‐bandgap acceptor, IEICO‐4F, is structurally incorporated with the BD2FCT polymer to further improve charge funneling and complementary absorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals enhanced hole transfer from CNC to BD2FCT‐29DPP:IEICO‐4F, resulting in reduced charge recombination and efficient charge extraction. Consequently, a BD2FCT‐based AgBiS2 CNC solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1%, demonstrating significant improvements in short‐circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Arrays of microdomes with varying radii are formed by transforming micropillars made of the positive photoresist through a single‐step reflow process. These inverted microdomes exhibit radius‐dependent structural colors via total internal reflection and optical interference. By controlling the density and size of the microdomes, retroreflective multicolor graphics are achieved with exceptional color representation and resolution.








Abstract
Structural colors are known for their tunability, fade resistance, and eco‐friendliness. Recent advancements have shown that such colors can be efficiently produced using total internal reflection (TIR) on high‐refractive‐index convex microstructures without the need for periodic nanostructures. However, a reproducible, fast, and programmable production strategy for these microstructures is essential for commercial applications. Here, a single‐step method is reported for creating multicolor patterns by transforming photolithographically‐patterned micropillars into microdomes through thermal reflow. These micropillars, uniform in height but varying in diameter, are converted into microdomes that differ in diameter and height, which display a full spectrum of structural colors, creating a versatile color palette. This process enables the production of high‐resolution multicolor graphics using a rainbow color set, with high reproducibility. Additionally, by mixing distinct microdomes and adjusting their densities, a rich variety of color presentations can be achieved, enabling the recreation of arbitrary color images with microdome arrays. The variable heights of the microdomes also allow for dynamic discoloration or color changes through mechanical compression. The high reproducibility and scalability of this method hold significant commercial promise for various optical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A mechanical robust and healable actuator material with muscle‐like diastole and contraction abilities is fabricated by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol‐modified nano‐assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro‐nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction endow obtained artificial muscle with high output actuation and robust mechanical properties, exceeding typical natural muscles, which pave the way for advancements in next‐generation intelligent robotics.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles represent a role model in soft robotics featuring agile locomotion and incredible mechanical robustness. However, existing actuators lack an optimal combination of actuation parameters (including actuation modes, work capacity, mechanical strength, and damage repair) to rival biological tissues. Here, a biomimetic structural design strategy via multilevel relaxations (α/β/γ/δ‐relaxation) modulation is proposed for mechanical robust and healable actuator materials with muscle‐like diastole and contraction abilities by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol‐modified nano‐assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro‐nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction mimic the relative slippage of actin filaments and myosin in muscles, ensuring bistable actuation through rapid thermal α‐relaxation and expansion. Furthermore, kinetically active secondary β/γ/δ‐relaxation at reconfigurable interfaces can conquer the limited self‐healing ability of fixed‐orientation polymeric chains. The obtained artificial muscle exhibits high output actuation, robust mechanical properties (tensile strength of 33.5 MPa), and desired functional, mechanical self‐healing efficiency (89.7%), exceeding typical natural muscles in living systems. The bionic micro‐nano design strategy achieves bottom‐up cooperative relaxation modulation to integrate all‐round performance of natural muscles, which paves the way for substantial advancements in next‐generation intelligent robotics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Mild CF4 plasma is introduced to resolve the trade‐off between mobility and the on‐current (Ion)/off‐current (Ioff) ratio  in degenerate oxide semiconductors without the need for thermal annealing. This technique effectively reduces carrier density, achieving a high Ion/Ioff ratio (10⁸) while preserving high mobility (104 cm2 V−1s−1) of thick In2O3 transistors, leading to enhanced switching performance and making it ideal for three‐dimensional integration in advanced electronic devices.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are pivotal for next‐generation electronics due to their high electron mobility and excellent optical properties. However, In2O3, a key material in this family, encounters significant challenges in balancing high mobility and effective switching as its thickness is scaled down to nanometer dimensions. The high electron density in ultra‐thin In2O3 hinders its ability to turn off effectively, leading to a critical trade‐off between mobility and the on‐current (Ion)/off‐current (Ioff) ratio. This study introduces a mild CF4 plasma doping technique that effectively reduces electron density in 10 nm In2O3 at a low processing temperature of 70 °C, achieving a high mobility of 104 cm2 V⁻¹ s⁻¹ and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 10⁸. A subsequent low‐temperature post‐annealing further improves the critical reliability and stability of CF4‐doped In2O3 without raising the thermal budget, making this technique suitable for monolithic three‐dimensional (3D) integration. Additionally, its application is demonstrated in In2O3 depletion‐load inverters, highlighting its potential for advanced logic circuits and broader electronic and optoelectronic applications.

<title>Asymmetric Structural MXene/PBO Aerogels for High‐Performance Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ultra‐Low Reflection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By means of in situ growth method, heterostructure MXene@Ni electromagnetic functional fillers with good impedance matching performance are prepared by “electrostatic adsorption‐solvothermal reduction”. And the obtained asymmetric structural (MXene@Ni/PNF)‐(MXene/PNF) aerogels prepared by layer‐by‐layer freeze‐drying based on the layered modular design concept present high‐performance electromagnetic interference shielding with ultra‐low reflection and infrared camouflage.








Abstract
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with low electromagnetic (EM) waves reflection characteristics are ideal materials for blocking EM radiation and pollution. Materials with low reflectivity must be constructed using materials with excellent EM waves absorption properties. However, materials simultaneously possessing both low reflectivity and excellent EMI shielding performance remain scarce, consequently, multilayer structures need to be developed. Poly(p‐phenylene–2,6–benzobisoxazole) nanofibers (PNF) are prepared by deprotonation. PNF are combined with MXene and heterostructure MXene@Ni prepared by in‐situ growth; MXene@Ni/PNF acts as an EM absorption layer while MXene/PNF acts as an EM reflective layer. Finally, (MXene@Ni/PNF)–(MXene/PNF) aerogels are prepared by layer‐by‐layer freeze‐drying based on the layered modular design concept. Experimental characterizations revealed that (MXene@Ni/PNF)–(MXene/PNF) aerogels enable the efficient absorption‐reflection‐reabsorption of EM waves, effectively eliminating EMI. When the mass ratio of MXene to Ni in MXene@Ni is 1:6 and the mass fraction of MXene in the reflective layer is 80 wt.%, the (MXene@Ni/PNF)–(MXene/PNF) aerogels exhibit excellent EMI shielding performance (71 dB) and a very low reflection coefficient (R = 0.10). Finite element simulations verified that the developed asymmetric structural aerogels achieve high EMI shielding performance with low reflection characteristics. In addition, (MXene@Ni/PNF)–(MXene/PNF) aerogels display excellent infrared camouflage ability.

<title>Structure‐Induced Energetic Coordination Compounds as Additives for Laser Initiation Primary Explosives</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414886?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414886?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) are first used as additives to lead azide (LA) to design laser ignition primary explosives. These laser‐sensitive mixed composites exhibit remarkable initiating ability, extremely low laser initiation threshold (Emin), fast response times (Tmin), and acceptable stabilities. The strategy can broaden new application scenarios and unveil new perspectives for coordination compounds as additives in advanced laser pyrotechnics for aerospace applications.








Abstract
Laser ignition of primary explosives presents more reliable alternative to traditional electrical initiation methods. However, the commercial initiator lead azide (LA) requires a high‐power density laser to detonate, with the minimum laser initiation energy (Emin) of 2402 mJ. Currently, the laser‐ignitable metal complex‐based igniters still suffer from weak detonation capabilities and high Emin values. Here, the approach is first proposed to design laser ignition primary explosives within the high energy azide and tetrazole‐based energetic coordination compounds (ECCs), [Co(N3)(2‐bmttz)(H2O)]2 1 and [Co(N3)(2‐bmttz)(MeOH)]2 2 as additives to LA. Material 1e with 4 wt.% of 1 in LA, exhibits ultra‐low laser initiation threshold (Emin = 1.6 mJ) and ultrafast corresponding time (Tmin = 0.2 ms). Specially, compared to LA, the threshold of 1e is as low as 1/1500 of that of LA. Moreover, 30 mg 1e successfully detonates RDX with a laser energy of 1.6 mJ. Theoretical calculations and experiment results reveal that 1 exhibits the superior additive effect compared to 2, attributed to its more enhanced ability to generate free radicals and higher photothermal conversion efficiency under laser conditions. This work represents a paradigm shift, with the potential to develop a laser‐driven micro‐detonator combining powerful detonation capabilities with exceptionally low laser initiation energy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The built‐in electric fields (BIEFs) in the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors can be gradiently modulated via tailoring the sulfur vacancies, and exhibit parabola‐shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities. Moderate BIEF evidently facilitates the hydrogen desorption in the HER and the breakage of N─H bond in the UOR, endowing the Mo/MoSV1 electrolyzer with superior activity and durability.








Abstract
Constructing built‐in electric field (BIEF) in heterojunction catalyst is an effective way to optimize adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, while its precise tailor to achieve efficient bifunctional electrocatalysis remains great challenge. Herein, the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors with tunable BIEFs are elaborately prepared to simultaneously promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for sustainable hydrogen production. The BIEF induced by sulfur vacancies can be modulated from 0.79 to 0.57 to 0.42 mV nm−1, and exhibits a parabola‐shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities, the Mo/MoSV1 nanoreactor with moderate BIEF presents the best bifunctional activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the moderate BIEF can evidently facilitate the hydrogen adsorption/desorption in the HER and the breakage of N─H bond in the UOR. The electrolyzer assembled with Mo/MoSV1 delivers a cell voltage of 1.49 V at 100 mA cm−2, which is 437 mV lower than that of traditional water electrolysis, and also presents excellent durability at 200 mA cm−2 for 200 h. Life cycle assessment indicates the HER||UOR system possesses notable superiority across various environment impact and energy consumption. This work can provide theoretical and experimental direction on the rational design of advanced materials for energy‐saving and eco‐friendly hydrogen production.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c‐MOFs) are introduced as a novel class of multicolor electrochromic materials with significant potential for the next‐generation flexible electrochromic devices (FMEDs). This perspective provides new insights into the coloring mechanisms and presents strategies for optimizing device performance, highlighting potential multidisciplinary applications in camera lenses, camouflage, displays, and wearable electronics.








Abstract
There has been considerable interest in 2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c‐MOFs) for their potential applications in sensors, opto‐electronics, catalysis, and energy storage, owing to their ultra‐high specific surface area, relatively high electrical conductivity, and tunable pore channel sizes for ion/charge diffusion/adsorption. The unique advantages brought by systematic tunings in the metal nodes and organic ligands enable the creation of highly accessible and remarkable structures with diverse chemical and physical behaviors. While the 2D c‐MOFs are being explored for the rapid widening spectrum of applications, in this work, the great potential of multicolor transitions and functional properties of these 2D c‐MOFs are examined for the new generation of flexible multicolor electrochromic devices (FMEDs). Despite the rather limited and yet steady progress that has been made so far, 2D c‐MOFs offer great opportunities in addressing the monotonous color switching, undesirable stability, as well as the sluggish kinetics of electron/ion transportation, which are typically encountered by the conventional electrochromic materials. Together with the main challenges that are being faced, this perspective provides a timely re‐visit to the expected transition in the near future from the proof‐of‐concept demonstration to the eventual industrial‐scale implementation of 2D c‐MOFs in the new generation FEMDs.

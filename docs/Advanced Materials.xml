This study develops a bone‐bioinspired photoresin containing PNCs of calcium phosphates, enabling nanoscale precision via 2pp. This novel approach allows for 2D patterning and 3D nanostructuring of CaPs with intricate geometries. The technique offers unparalleled control over scaffold design and porosity, paving the way for advanced applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are ubiquitous in biological structures, such as vertebrate bones and teeth, and have been widely used in biomedical applications. However, fabricating CaPs at the nanoscale in 3D has remained a significant challenge, particularly due to limitations in current nanofabrication techniques, such as two‐photon polymerization (2pp), which are not applicable for creating CaP nanostructures. In this study, a novel approach is presented to 3D print CaP structures with unprecedented resolution of ≈300 nm precision, achieving a level of detail three orders of magnitude finer than any existing additive manufacturing techniques for CaPs. This advancement is achieved by leveraging bioinspired chemistry, utilizing bone prenucleation nanoclusters (PNCs, average size of 5 nm), within a photosensitive resin. These nanoclusters form a highly transparent photoresist, overcoming the light‐scattering typically associated with larger calcium phosphate‐based nanoparticles. This method not only allows for nanopatterning of CaPs on diverse substrates, but also enables the precise control of microstructure down to the level of submicron grains. The method paves the way for the developing of bioinspired metamaterials, lightweight damage‐tolerant materials, cell‐modulating interfaces, and precision‐engineered coatings.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding‐on‐demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.








Abstract
Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high‐value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding‐on‐demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate‐filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite. Under controlled compression, these microcapsules rupture precisely, releasing their contents to induce sufficient adhesive plasticization to enable effortless debonding. Our results indicate that while the inclusion of microcapsules affects adhesion strength and toughness, the overall mechanical performance remains stable across different concentrations. Thermal tests highlight a 50 wt.% microcapsule concentration as optimal for enhanced plasticization, while compression tests show that an applied force of 5 kN achieves maximum capsule rupture without compromising substrate integrity. Ultimately, specimens bonded with the responsive composite under compression exhibit a striking 1200% increase in creep rates compared to those bonded with the neat adhesive, allowing for effective debonding‐on‐demand—an outcome unattainable with the neat adhesive. This simple and highly versatile approach lays the groundwork for advancing the development of more sustainable and functional adhesive materials.

<title>Unlocking the Sodium Storage Potential in Fluorophosphate Cathodes: Electrostatic Interaction Lowering Versus Structural Disordering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Na+‐density and degree of order in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F cathode are regulated via divalent cation doping to compare the importance of electrostatic interaction and Na+‐ordering on the Na+ diffusivity and storage property. A higher Mg2+‐doping concentration at both Na‐ and V‐site, though incorporating extra Na+ and higher repulsive forces, contributes to a higher structural disorder, which reveals a higher throughout Na+ diffusivity with a superior energy/power density.








Abstract
Electrostatic interaction and Na+‐ordering are identified as two possible kinetic constraints in determining the Na+ diffusivity in Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF), a representative polyanionic‐based cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries. As both factors are compositionally related and intertwined, isolating individual factors to pinpoint the dominant one is essential yet challenging for achieving the full electrochemical potential of NVPOF. Herein, NVPOF doped with Zn2+ or Mg2+ is developed to study the relative influence of the electrostatic interaction and structural disordering on the Na+ diffusivity and thus Na+ storage performance. The crystal structural analysis and theoretical modeling reveal that a limited amount (0.6 at% of Na) of Zn2+ doped at the Na‐site with Na‐vacancies created, while a ten‐fold higher Mg2+ doped at both the Na‐ and V‐site, which introduces additional Na+ for charge compensation. As a result, compared to the Zn2+ doped counterpart, the Mg2+ doped NVPOF cathode shows a Na+ diffusivity up to 3 times higher even encountering larger repulsive forces, and a much enhanced Na+ storage property. This work demonstrates the superiority of regulating the degree of order in the framework to address the defect formation energy of NVPOF, which is realized via doping and can be extendable to other polyanionic‐based cathode materials.

<title>Gallium‐Magnesium Layered Double Hydroxide for Elevated Tumor Immunotherapy Through Multi‐Network Synergistic Regulation</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202501256?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202501256?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multi‐network synergistic treatment strategy is designed to form a powerful therapeutic network to improve tumor immunotherapy by coordinating multiple immune activation mechanisms such as autophagy blocking, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, immunogenic cell death, and STING activation, which improves the immunogenicity, reverses the immunosuppressive TME, breaks the immune barrier, and promotes immune cell proliferation and infiltration.








Abstract
Immunotherapeutic efficacy is often limited by poor immunogenicity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and cytoprotective mechanisms, leading to low immune activation. To this end, here, L‐amino acid oxidase (LAAO) loaded gallium‐magnesium layered double hydroxide (MG‐LAAO) is prepared for significantly enhanced tumor immunotherapy through multi‐network synergistic regulation. First, MG‐LAAO induces tumor cell pyroptosis by initiating caspase‐1/GSDMD and caspase‐3/GSDME pathways, further triggering immunogenic cell death (ICD). Then the released Ga3+ induces mitochondrial iron overload, resulting in ferroptosis. In addition, MG‐LAAO also hinders autophagy of tumor cells, and reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) by neutralizing H+ and inhibiting lactic acid accumulation, thus destroying the cytoprotective mechanism and avoiding immune escape. Furthermore, this multi‐network synergy further activates the cGAS‐STING signaling pathway, generating powerful antitumor immunotherapy. This work highlights the critical role of synergies between autophagy block, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD in tumor immunotherapy, demonstrating the important role of this multi‐network synergy in effectively overcoming immunosuppressive TME and enhancing immunogenicity. In particular, the mechanism of gallium‐induced pyroptosis is revealed for the first time, providing theoretical support for the design of new materials for tumor immunotherapy in the future.

<title>A Colorful Electrochromic Infrared Emissivity Regulator for All‐Season Intelligent Thermal Management in Buildings</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202420578?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202420578?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A spectrally selective colorful electrochromic infrared emissivity regulator (CECIER) is presented for all‐season building thermal management. It enables multi‐modal dynamic infrared emissivity regulation in the atmospheric window while reducing parasitic heat through high reflectance in the non‐atmospheric window. The regulator achieves ≈2°C (night) and 3°C (day) temperature adjustments and 3.46 MJ m−2 annual building energy savings.








Abstract
Radiative cooling is a technology that utilizes the high emissivity of materials in the atmospheric window to achieve cooling, showing great application prospects in building energy‐saving. However, traditional static passive radiative cooling materials with broad‐spectrum high emissivity can lead to increased heating energy consumption in winter due to overcooling and a weakened cooling effect in summer due to the urban heat island effect. In this study, a colorful, intelligent infrared emissivity regulator is well designed based on a multi film ultrathin electrochromic device for all‐season thermal management in buildings. The infrared emissivity of the regulator can vary in real time in response to seasonal or temperature variations, allowing for the switching between radiative cooling and insulation. Guided by nano‐photonics theory for multilayer optical films, the regulator achieves multi‐modal dynamic infrared emissivity regulation in the atmospheric window Δε¯$\Delta \ \bar{\varepsilon }$Δε¯$\Delta \ \bar{\varepsilon }$, and the high reflectance in the non‐atmospheric window inhibits heat gains from the external environment. The regulator demonstrates excellent environmental adaptivity with an acceptable response time, a long cycle life, and good bending resistance. The regulator can achieve ≈2 °C/3 °C (nighttime/daytime) temperature adjustment. The simulation results indicate that the regulator can achieve an annual building energy saving of 3.46 MJ m−2.

<title>Ferroelectric Polarization Effects of Single‐Atom Catalysts on Water Oxidation</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202500285?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ferroelectric substrates offer a dynamic platform to enhance the catalytic performance of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By integrating high‐throughput computations and machine learning, this study reveals how to take advantage of ferroelectric polarization effect to fine‐tune the OER pathways on SACs. It advances the rational design of high‐efficiency SACs for sustainable energy conversion.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of single‐atom catalysts (SACs) heavily depends on their substrates. However, heterojunctions with traditional substrate materials often fail to provide the desired dynamic interface effects. Here, through a systematic study of the ferroelectric heterostructure In2Se3/C‐N‐M, the feasibility of using ferroelectric materials to achieve dynamic optimization of the OER activity on SACs is demonstrated. The ferroelectric In2Se3 is confirmed to be an effective substrate for improving the stability of various SACs, supported by theoretical results of their negative formation energy and positive dissolution potential. Activity analysis indicates that among these In2Se3/C‐N‐M systems, the In2Se3/C‐N‐Ir can achieve near‐ideal catalytic activities through polarization switching. It can unprecedentedly catalyze OER via a hybrid pathway of adsorbate evolution mechanism and O‐O coupling mechanism under different pH conditions (from pH = 1 to pH = 13). Machine learning models have been developed to conduct feature analysis and make ultrafast predictions of OER activity, which identify that the interfacial charge transfer triggered by ferroelectric polarization is the key to fine‐tuning the OER performance of SACs. This work provides a theoretical framework that utilizes ferroelectric polarization as a powerful approach to navigate the design of efficient SACs.

<title>Memristive InAs‐Based Semiconductors with Anisotropic Ion Transport</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202500056?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202500056?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Memristive semiconductor HxNa2‐xIn2As3 exhibits memristive switching and maintains semiconductor properties through ion migration in its vdW gaps. Low ion migration energy enables a low set voltage, while its low‐symmetry structure produces anisotropic ion transport, offering insights into directional dependence. These findings can guide the development of energy‐efficient memtransistors.








Abstract
The use of the van der Waals (vdW) gap as an ion migration path, similar to cathode materials in lithium‐ion batteries, enables improved ion migration. If these materials also possess semiconductor properties, they can simultaneously control electron or hole transport. Such materials can be used in memtransistors, which combine memory and semiconductor characteristics. However, the existing materials rely on defects such as grain boundaries as migration paths, resulting in high ion migration energy barriers and switching voltages. Herein, memtransistors are demonstrated using HxNa2‐xIn2As3, which utilizes the vdW gap for ion migration, resulting in lower ion migration energy barriers. It is confirmed that ion migration occurs more readily in the [010] direction in a low‐symmetry crystal structure owing to a lower migration energy barrier, whereas migration does not occur in the [100] direction, demonstrating directional dependence. This finding provides crucial guidelines for identifying ion migration in semiconductor materials, which can otherwise be overlooked. The use of the vdW gap as the migration path, variation in migration energy barriers with the ion movement direction, and their impact on low power consumption are critical factors that will guide the future development of memtransistor materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2,2,6,6‐Tetramethylpiperidin‐1‐oxyl radical (TEMPO)‐oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean‐electrolyte lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell‐level energy density of 503 Wh kg−1 at a low electrolyte‐to‐sulfur ratio of 2.0 µL mgsulfur−1.








Abstract
Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)‒ion batteries, Li–sulfur (Li–S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6‐tetramethylpiperidin‐1‐oxyl radical (TEMPO)‐oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean‐electrolyte Li‒S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter‐glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li‒S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh gsulfur−1 under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte‐to‐sulfur ratio of 2.0 µL mgsulfur−1 and low density of 0.927 g mL−1), yielding a high cell‐level energy density of 503 Wh kg−1 that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The stability of wide‐bandgap perovskite solar cells is reviewed, including its stabilization mechanism, stabilization methods, and application in tandem solar cells. The current challenges and future perspectives for research in this promising field are also presented.








Abstract
Tandem solar cells (TSCs) based on wide bandgap (WBG) perovskites have gained significant attention for their higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to single‐junction cells. The role of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as the sub‐cell in tandem cells consists of absorbing high‐energy photons and producing higher open‐circuit voltages (VOC). However, WBG PSCs face serious phase separation issues, resulting in poor long‐term stability and substantial VOC loss in TSCs. In response, researchers have developed a range of strategies to mitigate these challenges, showing promising progress, and a comprehensive review of these strategies is expected. In this review, we discuss the stability mechanism in organic–inorganic hybrids and all‐inorganic WBG perovskites. Additionally, we conduct an in‐depth investigation of various strategies to enhance stability, including component engineering, additive engineering, interface engineering, dimension control, solvent engineering, and encapsulation. Furthermore, the application of the WBG sub‐cell in various TSCs is summarized in detail. Finally, perspectives are provided to offer guidance for the development of efficient and stable WBG sub‐cell in the field of TSCs.

<title>“Mix‐and‐Match”: Self‐Sorting Assembly Governed Supramolecular Polymeric Nanomedicine for Boosting Combined Chemo/Phototherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Self‐sorting assembly mediated supramolecular nanoformulations are reported, featured by molecularly defined medicines and enhanced therapeutics. Specific ‘hydrogen‐bonding molecular instructions’ encoded in the structure of DAP/FU and HW/Ba pairs enables self‐sorting phenomena and selective association of multiple prodrugs. Moreover, distinct association constant of DAP/FU (≈102 M−1) and HW/Ba (≈104‐5 M−1) pairs endow programmable dissociation and specific chemo‐prodrug release through pH/thermal‐stimuli.








Abstract
Precise cancer nanomedicine requires rational molecular instructions of therapeutic agents. Harnessing the structure‐property‐function relationships represents a practical strategy toward smart and effective nanomedicine. A structurally novel hydrogen‐bonded (H‐bonded) supramolecular nanoformulation generated by orthogonal self‐sorting assembly of chemo‐prodrug (FPtF) and phototherapeutics (BPeB) is here reported, to reach an autonomous nanomedicine with improved anti‐tumor efficacy by combining chemo/phototherapy (CT/PT). The high‐fidelity of H‐bonding modularity from privileged heterocomplementary diaminopyridine/5‐fluorouracil (DAP/FU) and Hamilton wedge/barbiturate (HW/Ba) pairs, respectively enable the precise spatial control of binding interactions toward FPtF and BPeB, in turn allowing the self‐sorting process and specific “mix‐and‐match” capability. To directly stimulate phototherapy from BPeB via near‐infrared (NIR) light, spectral matched upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs, β‐NaYF4:Yb,Er) are encapsulated simultaneously. As a result, supramolecular polymeric nanomicelles, i.e., F/B/U@PHDO, are readily fabricated. Moreover, distinct H‐bonding association constant (Ka) of DAP/FU (≈102 M−1) and HW/Ba (≈104‐5 M−1) pairs reflect different strengths and stabilities of H‐bonds, thus endowing the programmable H‐bonding dissociation, accompanied with the chemo‐prodrug release through pH/thermal‐stimuli. Therapeutic regime with appreciated anti‐tumor outcomes is ultimately accomplished via combined CT/PT. The privileged opportunities offered by self‐sorting design are anticipated to point to new paradigm toward precise nanomedicine for cancer therapy.

<title>Current Control of Spin Helicity and Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in a Multiferroic Conductor</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A conducting multiferroic state of spin origin with both electronic polarity (P) and magnetization (M) can be controlled and detected by electric current in a high‐temperature helimagnet YMn6Sn6. The underlying concept is the coupling of the electric current with the toroidal moment T∼P×M$\bm{T}\sim \bm{P}\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}$. The controllability of state variables like P and T in conductors enhances the potential of spin‐helicity‐based spintronics.









Abstract
A multiferroic state with both electronic polarity (P) and magnetization (M) shows the inherently strong P‐M coupling when P is induced by cycloidal (Néel‐wall like) spin modulation. The sign of P is determined by the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, the current control of the multiferroics is reported in a helimagnetic metal YMn6Sn6 and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment T∼P×M∼(q̂×χv)×M$\bm{T}\sim \bm{P}\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}\sim (\widehat{\bm{q}}\ensuremath{\times{}}{\bm{\chi}}_{v})\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}$ as well as with the magneto‐chirality χv · M, whereq̂$\hspace*{0.28em}\widehat{\bm{q}}$ and χv are the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. An enhancement of NRR is furthermore observed by the spin‐cluster scattering via χv and its fluctuation. These findings may pave the way to an exploration of multiferroic conductors and the application of the spin‐helicity degree of freedom as a state variable.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel PFOE Artificial Synapse integrating multimodal fusion perception in one device with a single functional material is presented, enabled by combined ferroelectricity (for synaptic behaviors), piezoelectricity (for tactile modulation), and optoelectronic responsiveness (for visual detection) of NbOI2. Under the synergistic modulation of strain and light, visual‐tactile fusion perception has been fully demonstrated, advancing multifunctional sensing devices for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Multimodal sensory integration is vital for the evolution of artificial intelligence, yet current approaches often rely on physically connecting distinct sensing units (such as visual and tactile devices) through external circuits, leading to data transmission delays and information loss. Here, a groundbreaking paradigm is demonstrated for integrating visual‐tactile fusion perception in one device with a single functional material. This is achieved by developing an unprecedented 2D Piezo‐Ferro‐Opto‐Electronic (PFOE) Artificial Synapse, which combines the comprehensive ferroelectricity (for synaptic behaviors), piezoelectricity (for tactile modulation), and optoelectronic responsiveness (for visual detection) of strained 2D NbOI2. Under the synergistic influence of light and strain, the device exhibits remarkable persistent photoconductivity (PPC), a notable increase in paired‐pulse facilitation (PPF) index (from 116% to 180%), and a reduction in the power exponent of the sublinear power‐law fitting photocurrent curve (from 0.797 to 0.376). These features enhance the clarity and recognition of fingerprint images that integrate visual and tactile information. The work provides a robust foundation for integrating multisensory capabilities into advanced human‐machine interfaces and artificial intelligence systems, marking a significant leap forward in the development of multifunctional neuromorphic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hydrogen‐bonded organic framework solid‐state electrolytes are developed for stable and efficient solid‐state zinc‐ion batteries. The short‐distance Zn2+ conduction pathways and abundant hydrogen bonds network achieved the rapid Zn2+ conduction, the Zn dendrite growth, and hydrogen evolution reaction inhibition, displaying long‐term Zn stripping/plating stability, as well as endowing the solid‐state battery with high capacity and long‐term cycling stability.








Abstract
Solid‐state zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) hold great potential for sustainable and high‐safety reserves. However, the advancement of solid‐state ZIBs is constrained by the shortage of reasonable solid‐state electrolytes (SSE) with abundant hopping sites, effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) inhibition, and favorable interfacial compatibility. Herein, the hydrogen‐bonded organic framework (HOF) CAM‐Ag with Zn2+ hopping sites is developed as SSE for ZIBs. Taking advantage of the short‐distance Zn2+ conduction pathways by crystal transformation through incorporating the Ag−N coordinate bonds, CAM‐Ag SSE achieves a significant ionic conductivity of 1.14 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature and superior Zn2+ transference number of 0.72. An abundant hydrogen bonds network effectively inhibits the initiation of HER and the subsequent generation of by‐products. Moreover, the rapid Zn2+ conduction kinetics facilitated the inhibition of dendrite growth, promoting the uniform Zn2+ distribution. CAM‐Ag SSE displays an extensive electrochemical stability range of 0–2.66 V and remarkable electrochemical compatibility, enabling stable Zn2+ plating/stripping for ≈1000 h at 1 mA cm−2. Consequently, CAM‐Ag SSE‐based solid‐state ZIBs achieve a specific capacity of 315 mAh g−1 with only 1.5% decrease in capacitance after 24 h. The proposed HOF‐based SSE displays a potential pathway for advancing stable and high‐performance solid‐state ZIBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A red thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitter, named PBCNT, exhibits intense red emission at 664 nm in a toluene solution and a solution‐processed organic light‐emitting diode based on PBCNT achieved a record‐high maximum external quantum efficiency of 28.5% with a red emission peak at 608 nm using a multi‐resonance type thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter.








Abstract
Achieving high‐efficiency soluble red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters remains a substantial challenge owing to the constraints imposed by the energy‐gap law. In this study, an asymmetric pyrene‐azaacene derivative, named PBCNT, is prepared and characterized, featuring a strong electron‐donating tert‐butyl diphenylamine moiety and an electron‐withdrawing cyano group. PBCNT exhibits intense red emission with a peak wavelength of 664 nm in a toluene solution. It demonstrates an evident TADF character in the solid state, attributed to a small energy difference of 0.04 eV between its lowest singlet and triplet states. By employing a multi resonance‐type TADF molecule as the host matrix, a solution‐processed organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) based on PBCNT achieved a record‐high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.5%, with a red emission peak at 608 nm, facilitated by effective Förster energy transfer, good horizontal emitting dipole orientation and managed intermolecular interactions between the host and dopant. This represents one of the highest EQE values reported among solution‐processed red TADF OLEDs emitting electroluminescence at wavelengths greater than 600 nm. This paper introduces a promising pathway for developing efficient red TADF emitters that overcome the limitations of the energy‐gap law.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Structure‐tailored Co3O4 is employed to investigate how oxygen vacancies perform during CO2 (photo‐)methanation, revealing that oxygen vacancies boost the C─O bond scission, facilitating conversion of various oxygen‐containing intermediates. Notably, the C─O bond cleavage in key intermediate formate, identified as the rate‐limiting step, is accelerated on oxygen vacancy‐rich M‐Co3O4, leading to a high activity and selectivity in CH4 production.








Abstract
Oxygen vacancies are generally recognized to play significant roles in CO2 adsorption and activation during CO2 hydrogenation. However, by revisiting its structural/electronic affinity for a range of oxygen‐containing intermediates in CO2 hydrogenation processes, the additional roles of oxygen vacancies can be long overlooked and underestimated. Herein, using CO2 (photo‐)methanation as a model reaction, Co3O4 with abundant oxygen vacancies is employed to investigate the relationship between oxygen vacancies and the formation/conversion of oxygen‐containing intermediates. Combined analyses of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the key intermediate is formate, whose C─O bond cleavage is inferred to be the rate‐limiting step during CO2 methanation on Co3O4. Remarkably, leveraging the oxygen vacancy‐mediated C─O bond scission to accelerate the conversion of formate, the CH4 production activity (1108.1 mmol g−1 h−1) and selectivity (93%) are improved significantly. This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the multifaceted roles of oxygen vacancies in CO2 hydrogenation reactions, establishing a solid foundation toward the design and development of high‐performance oxide‐containing/‐based catalysts for the conversion of CO2 into various valuable chemicals.

<title>Engineered MSCs Break Endothelial‐Myofibroblast Crosstalk in Pulmonary Fibrosis: Reconstructing the Vascular Niche</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414601?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414601?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The engineered MSCs (MSC‐MM@LPHN) prepared based on surface‐anchoring nanoparticle technology can trigger the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP‐2) response to release drug‐loaded nanoparticles (MM@LPHN) and break the malignant regulatory network between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells in the fibroblastic foci. Combined with the pro‐angiogenic effect of MSCs achieve the reconstruction of the vascular niche, the engineered MSCs promote lung tissue regeneration and treat pulmonary fibrosis.








Abstract
In the progress of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the normal vascular niche plays a crucial role in alveolar regeneration by secreting angiocrine factors. However, the malignant interaction between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells results in significant loss of pulmonary capillaries in fibroblast foci, which promotes continuous deterioration of fibrosis. Herein, an engineered mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapeutic named MSC‐MM@LPHN is developed for reconstructing the vascular niche, which is formed by modifying the surface of MSC with ROS‐responsive lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles encapsulating the metformin and macitentan. Due to the homing ability of MSC, the MSC‐MM@LPHN can effectively target lung tissue, then induce myofibroblast dedifferentiation to reduce the secretion of cytokines that cause endothelial cell damage and preventing endothelial cells from turning into a fibrotic phenotype, leading to recovery of the vascular endothelial cells function. Combined with the role of MSC‐secreted growth factors promoting angiogenesis, the MSC‐MM@LPHN ultimately constructs normal vascular structure in the fibroblast area and reverses bleomycin‐induced PF. The findings suggest targeting the cell network in the vascular niche can effectively treat PF, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis‐related diseases.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inducibly degradable enamine N‐oxide crosslinkers are integrated into tough double network hydrogels, enabling rapid and bioorthogonal degradation by aqueous diboron solutions. These chemical reagent‐responsive biomaterials maintain structural integrity during use while enabling rapid degradation when needed, making them ideal for applications in intraoral wound dressings. These findings highlight the potential of the enamine N‐oxide crosslinker in polymer and materials chemistry.








Abstract
Inducibly degradable polymers present new opportunities to integrate tough hydrogels into a wide range of biomaterials. Rapid and inducible degradation enables fast transition in material properties without sacrificing material integrity prior to removal. In pursuit of bioorthogonal chemical modalities that will enable inducible polymer degradation in biologically relevant environments, enamine N‐oxide crosslinkers are developed for double network acrylamide‐based polymer/alginate hydrogels. Bioorthogonal dissociation initiated by the application of aqueous diboron solution through several delivery mechanisms effectively lead to polymer degradation. Their degradation by aqueous B2(OH)4 solution results in a fracture energy half‐life of <10 min. The biocompatibility of the degradable hydrogels and B2(OH)4 reagent is assessed, and the removability of strongly adhered tough hydrogels on mice skin is evaluated. Thermoresponsive PNiPAAm/Alg hydrogels are fabricated and application of the hydrogels as a chemically inducible degradable intraoral wound dressing is demonstrated. It is demonstrated through in vivo maximum tolerated dose studies that diboron solution administered to mice by oral gavage is well tolerated. Successful integration of enamine N‐oxides within the tough double network hydrogels as chemically degradable motifs demonstrates the applicability of enamine N‐oxides in the realm of polymer chemistry and highlights the importance of chemically induced bioorthogonal dissociation reactions for materials science.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work develops a temperature‐sensitive ionic liquid consisting of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) as a multifunctional thermal ablation sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA disrupts tumor matrix and modulates cancer‐associated fibroblasts, thus facilitating its heat/mass transfer in tumors. Meanwhile, LACH/PNA demonstrates specific cytotoxicity on hepatoma cells and is further intensified by thermal treatment.








Abstract
Thermal ablation (TA) is widely used for clinical treatment of various cancers. However, TA often struggles to efficiently kill tumor cells without injuring adjacent normal tissues/cells, leading to thermo‐mediated tumor relapse and metastasis, owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment surrounding residual tumor cells. In this study, a temperature‐sensitive ionic liquid composed of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) is developed as a multifunctional TA sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA exhibits a high diffusion coefficient by disrupting the tumor matrix and modulating cancer‐associated fibroblasts, thereby facilitating heat and mass transfer in tumors. LACH/PNA demonstrates greater cytotoxicity toward hepatoma cells than on normal hepatocytes with this effect further intensified by thermal treatment. These findings highlight LACH/PNA as a promising multifunctional sensitizer for clinical chemoablation‐microwave ablation synergy.

<title>Friction Memory Ionogels With Hysteretic Sticky‐Slippery Transition via Thermolocking the Metastable state</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202416250?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Owing to the kinetic differences between the evolution of the condensed structure in the bulk and the adsorption of droplets on the surface, on‐demand friction memory is achieved without persistent stimulus.








Abstract
Many biological organisms possess adaptive friction states and display hysteretic friction recovery, allowing them to achieve specific friction memory after environment change. However, current artificial materials have limitations in maintaining on‐demand friction states upon withdrawal of external triggers due to their strong dependence on external stimulus. Here, thermally induced phase separation ionogels with friction memory are reported. The kinetic difference between the evolution of bulk condensed structure and the adsorption of surface droplets after removing external stimulus delayed the recovery of friction state transition from slippery to sticky, thus achieving responsive friction memory. In addition, the metastable intermediate state generated during phase separation could be locked through vitrification, resulting in three distinct friction states determined by the synergy of stiffness and surface properties, including sticky state (coefficient of friction of 1.8), medium state (0.3–0.5) and slippery state (0.03–0.07). As a proof‐of‐concept, smart devices with diverse surface friction performance are engineered to realize various functions, including recognition of thermal range for target objects, de‐icing, and movement manipulation. These results provide new insights for expanding the applications of ionogels in state‐of‐the‐art soft robotics and haptic engineering, offering fresh perspectives for further development of these fields.

An in‐situ heating solution for 3D food printing is developed by incorporating noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources during the printing process. This technique ensures food quality control and reduces microbial contamination. The AI‐generated 3D food shape design allows users to create digital models using text input without prior computational skills.








Abstract
3D food printing is an indispensable technology for emerging food technologies. However, conventional nonconcurrent postprocessing methods limit the final food quality, including the unappealing nature of food ink modification, imperfections in retaining the desired food shape, and the risk of microbial contamination.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multi‐layered printed electronics are generally fabricated by overprinting with multiple stamps. Herein, a novel printing approach is introduced by modifying stamp with patterned surface energy. This enables the fabrication of multiple functional layers using only one stamp. Using this method, the fabrication of flexible light‐emitting devices and high‐denstiy transistor array are demonstrated (with over 17,900 transistors on an 8‐inch wafer).








Abstract
Beyond its role in cultural communication, printing technology has emerged as one of the most important approaches to distributing and patterning functional materials for advanced manufacturing. In a printing process, a stamp is employed to transfer functional inks to a target surface, generating a specific pattern that exactly replicates the stamp. Through precise manipulation of different inkdrops, herein, a “one stamp, diverse patterns” printing strategy is developed and achieves deposition of varied patterns utilizing a single stamp. This stamp features patterned surface energy, achieved through regioselective energy injection treatment of an ultralow surface energy solid. It is revealed that inks with different surface tensions can selectively exhibit Cassie or Wenzel state on the stamp to generate diverse ink distributions, which enables the printing of distinct patterns on target surfaces. Leveraging this approach, flexible light‐emitting devices and high‐density transistor array are successfully printed using single stamps. These findings advance the understanding of finely tuning and patterning surface energy for precise liquid manipulation and offer a leap forward in efficient and versatile printing methodology that will boost the innovative integration of functional materials in a simplified manner.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface‐enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag7O8NO3 microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.








Abstract
Nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with noncontaminated surfaces hold significant promise in catalytic and sensing fields. Fabrication of nanoporous metal microparticles without using any organic ligands remains a significant challenge. Here, a green synthesis strategy is presented inspired by dealloying mechanisms. Ag7O8NO3 microparticles are first electrodeposited. Subsequent chemical reduction process selectively removes nitrogen and oxygen species from the Ag7O8NO3 microparticles while preserving the original morphology, giving rise to the formation of nanoporous Ag microparticles without using organic agents under room temperature within several minutes. Based on the ion diffusion limited growth mechanism, a quantitative correlation is established between the opening size of the nanopores and the concentration of the reductive agents, allowing to rationally prepare nanopores with opening size ranging from < 20 nm to > 110 nm. The ultraclean surface of the nanoporous Ag microparticles guarantees a clean surface‐enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) background. Reliable and sensitive SERS detection of proteins by unfolding the protein structure is further demonstrated to expose the otherwise concealed parts to the nanoporous Ag microparticles. A simple but powerful approach is developed to design ultraclean nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with promising applications in those fields requiring clean surfaces, such as in SERS sensing and catalytic fields.

<title>Plasma Membrane Targeted Photodynamic Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy by Initiating Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Depleting Infiltrating B Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist called PMTPN is designed to target tumor tissues and anchor on plasma membrane, aiming to initiate tumor cell pyroptosis and deplete infiltrating B cells. Consequently, PMTPN promotes DCs maturation and CTLs infiltration, while decreasing Tregs, greatly reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade therapy for primary and distant tumor eradication.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable benefits in the treatment of malignant tumors, but the clinical response rates are unsatisfied due to the low tumor immunogenicity and the abundant immunosuppressive cells. Herein, a plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist (designated as PMTPN) is developed to potentiate ICB therapy by initiating tumor cell pyroptosis and depleting infiltrating B cells. PMTPN is composed of a rationally designed chimeric peptide sequence loaded with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Ibrutinib). Notably, PMTPN is capable of sequentially targeting tumor and tumor cell membrane to trigger immunogenic pyroptosis and cause overwhelming release of cytokines, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activation. Meanwhile, PMTPN can also deplete infiltrating B cells and reduce the secretion of interleukin‐10 to decrease immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and enhance CTLs infiltration. Beneficially, the synergistic immune modulating characteristics of PMTPN potentiate ICB therapy to simultaneously eliminate primary and distant tumors. This study offers a promising strategy to elevate the immunotherapeutic response rate in consideration of the complex immunosuppressive factors.

<title>2D Metastable‐Phase Hafnium Oxide Triggers Hydrogen Spillover for Boosting Hydrogen Production</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hydrogen spillover is a widespread interfacial phenomenon involving the migration of equivalent amounts of H atoms from metal to support. The design of the substrate is crucial for triggering hydrogen spillover. Metastable‐phase hexagonal phase hafnium oxide substrate can trigger efficient hydrogen spillover after loading ruthenium, yet the same phenomenon is forbidden on the stable phase monoclinic phase hafnium oxide substrate.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H) manipulation plays a significantly important role in many important applications, in which the occurrence of hydrogen spillover generally shows substrate‐dependent behavior. It therefore remains an open question about how to trigger the hydrogen spillover on the substrates that are generally hydrogen spillover forbidden. Here a new metastable‐phase 2D edge‐sharing oxide: six‐hexagonal phase‐hafnium oxide (Hex‐HfO2, space group: P63mc (186)) with the coordination number of six is demonstrated, which serves as an ideal platform for activating efficient hydrogen spillover after loading Ru nanoclusters (Ru/Hex‐HfO2). For a stark comparison, the hydrogen spillover is strongly forbidden when using stable monoclinic phase HfO2 (M‐HfO2, space group: P21/c (14), coordination number: seven) as the substrate. When applied in an acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru/Hex‐HfO2 exhibits a low overpotential of 8 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a high Ru utilization activity of 14.37 A mgRu−1 at 30 mV. Detailed mechanism reveals the positive H adsorption free energy on Hex‐HfO2, indicating that H is more likely to spillover on Hex‐HfO2. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Ru and Hex‐HfO2 optimizes the desorption of hydrogen intermediate, thus facilitating the surface H spillover. The discovery provides new guidance for developing metastable‐phase oxide substrates for advanced catalysis.

<title>One‐Step Symbiosis of Bimetallic Peroxides Nanoparticles to Induce Ferroptosis/Cuproptosis and Activate cGAS‐STING Pathway for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The designed zinc‐copper bimetallic peroxides nanoparticles, which are synthesized through a one‐step symbiotic method by co‐hydrolysis of metal acetates, can release Zn2+, Cu2+, and H2O2 in TME to induce ferroptosis/cuproptosis and activate cGAS‐STING pathway. Therefore, anti‐tumor adaptive and innate immunotherapy can be simultaneously promoted to effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis with assistance of immune checkpoint inhibitor.








Abstract
To improve the efficiency and application prospects of metal peroxides in tumor therapy, the synthesis of bimetallic peroxides via simple yet effective approaches will be highly significant. In this work, hyaluronic acid modified zinc‐copper bimetallic peroxides (ZCPO@HA) nanoparticles are synthesized through a one‐step symbiotic method by co‐hydrolysis of zinc acetate and copper acetate in weakly alkaline solution, followed by modification with sodium hyaluronate. Upon decomposition in the tumor microenvironment, ZCPO@HA nanoparticles can generate a considerable content of hydroxyl radical (·OH) by Fenton‐like reaction between Cu2+ and self‐compensating hydrogen peroxide, while downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 to induce ferroptosis. The abundant release of Cu2+ leads to the aggregation of dihydrolipoamide S‐acetyltransferase and the reduction of iron‐sulfur cluster proteins, causing cuproptosis. The immunogenic cell death of tumor cells releases abundant damage associated molecular patterns, effectively activating the adaptive immune response. Zn2+ and ·OH cause mitochondrial damage, leading to the release of a substantial amount of mitochondrial DNA. This subsequently activates the cyclic guanosine monophosphate‐adenosine monophosphate synthase‐stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS‐STING) pathway, enhancing the innate immune response. In conclusion, it synthesizes a new type of bimetallic peroxides by one‐step symbiosis for activating anti‐tumor immunotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work develops a molten salt strategy for synthesizing single‐atom catalysts at 450 °C via LiCl/KCl‐mediated Fe2+/Zn2+ exchange on nitrogen‐doped carbon substrates. By stabilizing Fe2+ ions and suppressing the Fe‐oxide nanoparticle formation—a common limitation in conventional high‐temperature pyrolysis—it achieves a 3.9 wt.% Fe loading of atomically dispersed Fe‐N4 sites, delivering superior H2—O2 fuel cell performance.








Abstract
High‐temperature pyrolysis (HTP, ≥900 °C) is a widely used method for synthesizing single‐atom catalysts (SACs). However, the high operational temperatures required for HTP pose significant challenges in achieving high single‐atom loading, primarily due to the Ostwald ripening effect. In this work, a low‐temperature trans‐metalation synthesis approach is developed which involves the exchange of cation between transition metal ions (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, etc) and Zn2+ ions on a nitrogen‐doped carbon (NC) matrix within a molten salt medium. This strategy effectively avoids phase transformations and enables the direct formation of high mass loading (3.7–4.7 wt.%) of atomically dispersed M‐N4 sites. Both experimental and theoretical analyses confirm that this cation‐exchange occurs at a lower temperature threshold of 450 °C, significantly reducing the energy barriers for SACs synthesis. Furthermore, the synthesized catalyst with atomically dispersed Fe sites demonstrate excellent performance toward oxygen reduction reaction and fuel cell with a peak power density of 1.12 W cm−2 in an H2─O2 fuel cell at 1.0 bar and 80 °C.

The CDs crosslinked egg white hydrogel loaded with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CA170 (TTF‐L‐C) can realize spatiotemporal tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) transformation from multi‐level dimensions, including spatial recruitment, cell phenotype reprogramming, and immune checkpoint molecule blockade. Finally, at the in vivo level, TTF‐L‐C can stimulate anti‐tumor immunity through tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling and reduce tumor recurrence with satisfactory biosafety.








Abstract
As one of the most crucial immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulating tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) is vital for enhancing antitumor immunity. Here, an injectable carbon dots (CDs)‐linked egg white hydrogel was developed, termed TAMs Transform Factory (TTF‐L‐C), to spatiotemporally manipulate TAMs. The fabricated CDs significantly promoted macrophage migration. Notably, TTF‐L‐C achieved macrophage spatial enrichment through CDs‐induced directional recruitment with molecular Ctnnd1 upregulation. Subsequently, the recruited macrophages were locoregionally reprogrammed within TTF‐L‐C, as well as blocking the upregulated PD‐L1. Finally, through multi‐stage regulation at spatial, cellular, and molecular levels, TTF‐L‐C released immune‐activated M1 macrophages to the tumor site as it degraded. Moreover, TTF‐L‐C promoted dendritic cell (DCs) maturation and further boosted T cell activation, thereby reshaping the tumor‐suppressive TME. Through peritumoral injection, TTF‐L‐C enhanced tumor immunotherapy in both subcutaneous and recurrent 4T1 tumor models with satisfactory biosafety. Therefore, TTF‐L‐C is proposed to become a safe and powerful platform for various biomedical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high‐performance carbon capture using fluorine‐tailored carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes is developed. By incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups into the polymer precursor, the derived CMS membranes achieve exceptional CO₂ permeability of 47,190 Barrer and CO2/N2 selectivity of 28.3, maintaining 36,204 Barrer permeability and 35.3 selectivity under flue gas conditions.








Abstract
Increasing energy consumption and climate change present an urgent global challenge to achieve carbon neutrality, with CO2 capture as a top priority. Among various carbon capture technologies, CO2 membrane separation stands out for its simplicity and energy efficiency in applications including gas purification and industrial gas recovery. Herein, a series of fluorine‐tailored porous carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes derived from precisely designed precursors, achieving a well‐balanced high permeability and selectivity for CO2 separation are developed. Incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups disrupted dense chain packing and promoted pore formation with enhanced permeability and selectivity for CO2 separation. The TFM‐550 membrane, derived from a fluorinated stretched polymer backbone precursor, exhibits exceptional performance with a CO2 permeability of 47 190 ± 3204 Barrer and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 28.3 ± 5.7, while TFM‐800 presented a higher selectivity of 71.8 ± 11.5, surpassing the 2019 upper bound. Furthermore, under flue gas conditions (CO2/O2/N2 = 1/1/4 in molar ratio), the CMS membrane demonstrate high CO2 permeability of 36,204 ± 2,235 Barrer and outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity of 35.3 ± 1.8. The results here highlight the effectiveness of fluorine tailoring and the potential of fluorinated CMS membranes for sustainable industrial carbon capture applications.

A defect‐rich, interlayer‐expanded MXene (Ex‐Ti3C2Tx‐3) film cathode, with abundant uncoordinated titanium atoms, stabilizes the bi‐electron pathway in Li–CO2 batteries, improving energy efficiency and durability. Its extended interlayer spacing and mesoporous structure enhance ion and CO2 transport, and the surface functionalization suppresses interfacial oxidation and maintains integrity. The battery achieves low polarization (0.39 V), high capacity (3452.33 µAh cm−2), and long life (>1660 h). The foldable Ex‐Ti3C2Tx‐3 cathode enables flexible Li–CO2 batteries, offering potential in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Aprotic Li–CO2 batteries have garnered significant attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and potential in zero‐carbon technology. However, their practical application remains hindered by sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CRR/CER) kinetics and limited flexibility. While 2D graphene‐like materials are commonly employed to settle these issues, their four‐electron pathway limits efficiency and reversibility. Herein, a defect‐rich, interlayer‐expanded Ti3C2Tx (Ex‐Ti3C2Tx) film cathode is presented for flexible Li–CO2 batteries. The extended interlayer space, reduced ─OH groups, and additional uncoordinated titanium atoms of Ex‐Ti3C2Tx enable abundant catalytic active sites, enhance ion and CO2 transport, and these surface functionalizations suppress interfacial oxidation. Notably, Ex‐Ti3C2Tx stabilizes the bi‐electron product Li2C2O4 via Ti3+/Ti2+ coupling bridges, effectively preventing disproportionation into Li2CO3, thereby significantly improving CRR/CER reversibility and lowering overpotential. Benefiting from these properties, Li–CO2 batteries with Ex‐Ti3C2Tx deliver a remarkable discharge capacity of 3452.33 µAh cm−2, a low polarization potential of 0.39 V, an energy efficiency exceeding 88.9%, and an ultra‐long cycling life (>1600 h). Furthermore, the belt‐shaped flexible battery exhibits excellent flexibility and stable electrochemical performance under deformation highlighting its potential in wearable electronics. This work underscores the critical role of MXene‐based materials in bi‐electron electrocatalytic mechanisms, providing insights for advancing reversible Li–CO2 batteries and flexible energy storage technologies.

Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R‐PCECs) face challenges from sluggish and unstable oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the air electrode. This review discusses recent progress in triple‐conducting air electrodes, emphasizing mechanisms, performance factors, and design strategies, offering guidance for creating efficient and stable air electrode materials for R‐PCECs.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R‐PCECs) have great potential for efficient and clean power generation, energy storage, and sustainable synthesis of high‐value chemicals. However, the sluggish and unstable kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode hinder the R‐PCEC development. Durable H+/e−/O2− triple‐conducting air electrode materials are promising for enhancing reaction kinetics and improving catalytical stability. This review synthesizes the recent progress in triple‐conducting air electrodes, focusing on their working mechanisms, including electrode kinetics, lattice and its defect structure in oxides, and the generation and transport processes of H+, O2−, and e−. It also examines the required physicochemical properties and their influencing factors. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the latest theoretical frameworks, advanced materials, and regulation strategies, this review outlines the challenges and prospects shaping the future of R‐PCEC technology and air electrode development. Based on these theories and multiple strategies about the bulk triple conducting properties and surface chemical states, this review provides practical guidance for the rational design and development of efficient and stable air electrode materials for R‐PCECs and related electrocatalytic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The work highlights the strong morphological optimization capacity of the solid additive DIDOB and elucidates its impact on molecular packing to suppress both bimolecular and geminate recombination in OSCs. As a result, DIDOB not only demonstrates universality in various non‐fullerene‐based OSCs but also achieves an impressive efficiency of 20.11% with a remarkable fill factor of 81.8% in the D18:PM6:L8‐BO‐based device.








Abstract
A volatile solid additive strategy, which can effectively optimize the morphology of the photoactive layer with an ideal domain size and purity, has emerged as a promising approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the precise role of solid additives in modulating charge and exciton dynamics, especially the recombination process, remains not fully understand. In this study, a solid additive, 1,4‐diiodo‐2,5‐dimethoxybenzene (DIDOB), is developed to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs and conduct a comprehensive investigation into its effect on the charge recombination process. As a result, the PM6:L8‐BO‐X‐based binary OSC processed with DIDOB achieves an excellent efficiency of 19.75% with a remarkable fill factor of 81.9%, owing to the optimal fiber network morphology, tighter and ordered molecular packing, as well as the suppression of both bimolecular and geminate recombination. Notably, the DIDOB exhibits broad universality as an additive in other non‐fullerene acceptor‐based OSCs. Impressively, the D18:PM6:L8‐BO‐based ternary device processed with DIDOB yielded an excellent efficiency of 20.11% (certified as 20.03%). This work highlights the effect of the solid additive on the charge recombination process within active layer and provides insights for the further development of OSCs.

<title>Decoupling Strategy of Metasurface to Realize Independent Sensing and Wave Manipulations at the Same Time</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202500266?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this article, a decoupling strategy of metasurface to realize independent sensing and wave manipulations at the same time is proposed. By allocating the reflectivity of all meta‐atoms across the space‐time dimensions, it is possible to realize arbitrary manipulation of electromagnetic waves while simultaneously sensing the wireless environment by the metasurface without integrating any sensors. An adaptive STCDM system is constructed and measured, showing excellent performances of sensing and wave manipulations in wireless communication scenarios.








Abstract
In recent years, integrating electromagnetic (EM) sensing and wave manipulation has become crucial for future wireless developments, significantly enhancing the application performance by acquiring complex environmental information and optimizing the distribution of EM resources. Metasurface offers unprecedented control over sensing and wave manipulation, yet a conflict arises in achieving both simultaneously. To solve the problem, a decoupling strategy is proposed to simultaneously realize sensing and wave manipulation using a space‐time‐coding digital metasurface (STCDM) without integrating any sensors. A space‐time‐coding matrix is constructed by allocating the reflectivity of all meta‐ atoms across the space‐time dimensions, enabling arbitrary manipulation of EM waves while simultaneously acquiring the sensing information at the incident frequency from metasurface. Excellent accuracy of direction‐of‐arrival estimation and wave manipulation confirms the decoupling method. An adaptive STCDM system is built up to validate the strategy in wireless communications. The measured results show that the adaptive STCDM enables independent sensing and wireless communications at the same time for targets located at different positions without integrating any sensors. The proposed method may find potential applications in wireless communication, radar, and Internet of Things systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Optically stable lead‐free 0D chiral (R/S‐methyl‐benzyl‐amine)‐bismuth‐iodide crystals showcase promising second and third‐order nonlinear optical properties. The chiral compounds show significant circularly polarized second harmonic generation. The achiral counterpart exhibits the most efficient third‐order optical nonlinearity.








Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides show great promise for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications like circularly polarized second harmonic generation (SHG). The inherent toxicity of lead is a concern for the widespread adoption of frequently explored lead‐based chiral hybrid halides. Here, we report the second and third‐order NLO properties of lead‐free 0D chiral compounds, (R‐/S‐MBA)4Bi2I10, and their achiral counterpart, (Rac‐MBA)4Bi2I10 (MBA: methylbenzylammonium) under excitation wavelength ranging 1360–1590 nm. Chiral (R‐/S‐MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibits strong SHG along with stronger third harmonic generation (THG). The chiral crystals showed high sensitivity to the handedness of circularly polarized pump light (gSHG − CD ≈ 9% at 1510 nm). The THG response shows resonance enhancement matching the excitonic absorption. Achiral (Rac‐MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibits the maximum THG response (χ(3) = 1.05 × 10⁻¹⁸ m2 V−2). Z‐scan measurements with non‐resonant femtosecond pulse excitation at 800 nm yield high nonlinear absorption coefficients (β) and nonlinear refractive index (n2) for all three samples, with (Rac‐MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibiting the highest values. These hybrid chiral metal halides, with efficient second and third‐order nonlinearity, and high optical stability, are potential candidates for NLO applications such as Kerr‐based optical switching, circularly polarized up‐conversion, and communication.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multimaterial volumetric and embedded extrusion bioprinting of complex cell‐laden architectures is enabled by unravelling the interplay between molecular weight and degree of functionalization in gelatin‐based bioresins. Tomographic light‐responsive support baths for suspended printing can be easily generated from single component materials. Molecular weight tuning produces a library of printable hydrogels matching the viscoleasticity properties of native tissues, influencing cell self‐organization.








Abstract
Volumetric Bioprinting (VBP), enables to rapidly build complex, cell‐laden hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Light‐based tomographic manufacturing enables spatial‐selective polymerization of a bioresin, resulting in higher throughput and resolution than what is achieved using traditional techniques. However, methods for multi‐material printing are needed for broad VBP adoption and applicability. Although converging VBP with extrusion bioprinting in support baths offers a novel, promising solution, further knowledge on the engineering of hydrogels as light‐responsive, volumetrically printable baths is needed. Therefore, this study investigates the tuning of gelatin macromers, in particular leveraging the effect of molecular weight and degree of modification, to overcome these challenges, creating a library of materials for VBP and Embedded extrusion Volumetric Printing (EmVP). Bioresins with tunable printability and mechanical properties are produced, and a novel subset of gelatins and GelMA exhibiting stable shear‐yielding behavior offers a new, single‐component, ready‐to‐use suspension medium for in‐bath printing, which is stable over multiple hours without needing temperature control. As a proof‐of‐concept biological application, bioprinted gels are tested with insulin‐producing pancreatic cell lines for 21 days of culture. Leveraging a multi‐color printer, complex multi‐material and multi‐cellular geometries are produced, enhancing the accessibility of volumetric printing for advanced tissue models.

<title>Simultaneously Tailoring Hydrostability and Photoelectroactivity in Heterocluster Metal–Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The first heterocluster‐based crystalline MOF photocatalysts integrating copper‐sulfur and copper‐halide clusters are obtained through the heterocluster assembly engineering and localized microenvironment regulation, demonstrating an unprecedented synergistic enhancement of hydrostability and photoelectroactivity, facilitating the efficient synthesis of green hydrogen at an exceptionally high rate under visible light.








Abstract
The simultaneous enhancement of structural stability and photoelectroactivity in metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) remains a critical challenge for sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production. Herein, an atomically‐precise heterocluster assembly approach is presented to construct two isostructural 3D MOFs, CuSL‐CuX (X = Cl, Br), featuring a cds net. CuSL‐CuXs integrate hexanuclear copper‐sulfur {Cu6S6} cluster and dinuclear copper‐halogen {Cu2X2} cluster, which not only impart exceptional stability across a broad pH range (1–14) but also enable wide visible‐light absorption, tailored redox potentials, and efficient charge‐carrier dynamics. Notably, halogen substitution markedly boosts photocatalytic activity: CuSL‐CuBr achieves an efficient H2 evolution rate of 50.28 mmol g−1 h−1 without noble metals, doubling that of CuSL‐CuCl (26.99 mmol g−1 h−1) and surpassing most reported MOF‐based photocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that bromine substitution optimizes electronic structure, refines orbital distribution, and accelerates charge separation, ultimately leading to promoted photocatalytic efficiency. This research provides insights into the structure‐property interplay in heterocluster MOFs and establishes a paradigm for designing robust, high‐performance photocatalysts through precise cluster engineering.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cu2‐xTe electrodes are disclosed in acidic multivalent‐ion batteries for the first time to achieve a high capacity of up to 409 mAh g−1 and a long cycling lifespan of 40 000 cycles. Composite in situ X‐ray diffraction measurements and spectroscopic analyses show that the synergistic copper‐ion/proton electrolyte environment ensures stable reversible storage of copper‐ions and prevents potential material oxidation.








Abstract
Acidic batteries permit a reliable energy supply at low temperatures with low cost and intrinsic safety, yet the development of stable acid‐resistant electrodes with high capacity and a reliable lifespan is still challenging. Herein, nonstoichiometric copper telluride (Cu2‐xTe) nanosheets are first explored as high‐performance electrodes for acidic batteries to provide a stable capacity release of 409 mAh g−1 with a record‐breaking lifespan of 40 000 cycles and excellent kinetics, enabling operation at a high current density of 20 A g−1. In contrast to the inherent perception of corrosive destruction of electrode materials by strongly acidic environments, the electrolyte environment enriched with copper ions and hydrogen ions synergistically stabilizes the Cu2‐xTe electrode and drives reversible multielectron transfer asymmetric deep conversion, which is confirmed by in situ synchrotron X‐ray diffraction, X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, first‐principal calculations, and composite electrochemical characterization. Therefore, Cu2‐xTe provides an impressive accumulation capacity of over 4764 Ah g−1, exceeding that of most acidic batteries, and works well at −20 °C. High‐performance Cu2‐xTe electrodes also promote the establishment of Cu2‐xTe//Mn2O3 and Cu2‐xTe//Fe acidic full cells enabling stable operation at room temperature and low temperature, offering promising opportunities for electrode progress in advanced acidic batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Biocompatible, low‐bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets are interfaced with non‐photosynthetic and non‐genetic engineered Escherichia coli for solar hydrogen production using near‐infrared light. The rationally designed polymer nanosheets play a crucial role in harnessing the broad solar spectrum and injecting photo‐generated electrons into bacteria, thereby enhancing hydrogen production.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of solar energy into clean hydrogen fuel presents a promising pathway for sustainable energy production. However, utilizing the full solar spectrum, particularly the near‐infrared (NIR) region, remains underexplored in photosynthetic biohybrid systems. In this study, biocompatible, low‐bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets (PyTT‐tBAL‐HAB) are developed to integrate with non‐photosynthetic, non‐genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) for enhanced solar‐driven biological hydrogen production. The PyTT‐tBAL‐HAB nanosheets exhibit unique NIR light absorption properties. Integrating these nanosheets with E. coli facilitates efficient electron transfer, resulting in a 1.96‐fold increase in hydrogen production rate under NIR light. Consequently, this photosynthetic biohybrid system achieves a quantum efficiency of 18.36% at 940 nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using low‐bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets as advanced photosensitizers in semi‐artificial photosynthetic systems, offering a robust platform for the effective utilization of the solar spectrum.

A strategy for azepination‐induced frontier molecular orbital (FMO) delocalization of multiple resonance (MR) emitters is proposed to construct long‐wavelength MR materials. Organic light‐emitting diode based on m‐PAz‐BNCz exhibits excellent electroluminescence performances with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.26, 0.70) and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.2%.








Abstract
Developing diversified construction strategies for high‐color‐purity and efficient multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR‐TADF) materials is a major strategic demand to meet the requirements of ultra‐high‐definition organic light‐emitting diode (OLED) displays, posing a significant challenge to the design and synthesis of emitters at the molecular level. Herein, a strategy is proposed for azepination‐induced frontier molecular orbital (FMO) delocalization of MR emitters, that is, embedding azepine into the prototype molecule BNCz can effectively improve the π‐conjugation degree and extend the FMO delocalization, thereby constructing a series of long‐wavelength MR‐TADF materials with narrowband emission. Through an intramolecular Scholl reaction, these target molecules with an azepine‐embedded core are afforded by one‐fold heptagonal cyclization of BNCz core and the phenyl ring attached to (aromatic amine‐substituted) aryl precursor. They all exhibit efficient green emission around 520 nm and narrow full‐widths at half‐maximum (FWHMs) of ≤ 37 nm in toluene. OLEDs employing these emitters show excellent electroluminescence (EL) performances, among which m‐PAz‐BNCz‐based OLED exhibits the optimal EL performances with a peak of 528 nm, a FWHM of 37 nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.70), and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.2%.

A lanthanide Eu(II) complex is demonstrated as an emitter in light‐emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) for the first time. The bis[hydrotris(3‐tert‐butylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) complex based LEC achieved a record‐breaking external quantum efficiency of 19.8% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.12, 0.18).








Abstract
Light‐emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) have good prospects in the solid‐state lighting field due to their simple single‐layer structure and low manufacturing cost. However, the lack of high‐efficiency blue LECs limits their development and further application. To solve this problem, many luminescent materials with various mechanisms such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, and thermally‐activated delayed fluorescence are studied as emitters in LECs. Besides these materials, herein lanthanide europium(II) (Eu(II)) complex with d‐f transition is demonstrated as a new type of emitter for LECs. In detail, a blue emitting Eu(II) complex bis[hydrotris(3‐tert‐butylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) is dispersed into 9‐(3‐(triphenylsilyl)phenyl)‐9H‐3,9′‐bicarbazole host and tetrahexylammonium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte to make a blend film, which attains a high photoluminescence quantum yield of ≈100%. The LEC using the blend film as an active layer achieves a blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and a record‐breaking external quantum efficiency of 19.8%, corresponding to an exciton utilization efficiency of ≈100%. This work reveals that Eu(II) complex with d‐f transition is a promising emitter toward high‐performance blue LECs, which can inspire further research on Eu(II) complex based LECs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Cd–S co‐alloying‐induced microstructural evolution enables high‐performance Sb2Te3‐based thermoelectrics. Subsequently, an innovative full‐scale Bi–Sb–Te segmented power generator is fabricated, extending the operational range of conventional Bi2Te3‐based modules from 500 to 650 K and achieving an exceptional efficiency of 9.3% under a distinct ΔT = 350 K. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability after 80‐cycle thermal shock and 160‐h thermal durability, highlighting great potential for low‐grade waste heat recovery.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) technology offers a promising solution for waste heat recovery, particularly in applications involving abundant low‐grade heat (<650 K). However, for over half a century, TE power generators have predominantly relied on Bi2Te3 alloys with limited efficiencies below 7%. Herein, Cd and S are doped into Sb2Te3 to promote microstructural regulation characterized by dense twin boundaries and dislocations, resulting in a 45% reduction of lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K. Combined with the optimized density‐of‐states effective mass and expanded band gap, the Cd0.04Sb1.96Te2.94S0.06 sample attains a peak ZT of 1.1 at 650 K and an average ZT of 1.0 from 500 to 650 K, while exhibiting remarkable compressive and bending strengths of 197 and 56 MPa. Most importantly, a well‐designed, homogeneous segmented TE power generator, constructed entirely from Bi–Sb–Te alloys, achieves a remarkable efficiency of 9.3% under a temperature gradient of 350 K, as certified by third‐party validation. This work provides new insights into extending the operation temperature of Bi2Te3, demonstrating great potential for low‐grade waste heat harvest.

<title>Designing Cellulose Triacetate‐Based Universal Binder for High‐Voltage Sodium‐Ion Battery Cathodes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Binding Strength</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cellulose triacetate‐based binder with broad compatibility, high ionic conductivity, and superior binding strength has been successfully designed and validated through its application in high‐voltage polyanionic cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)2O2F), layered oxide cathodes (NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2), and tunnel‐type oxide cathodes (Na0.61[Mn0.27Fe0.34Ti0.39]O2). This work presents a sustainable and effective strategy for achieving high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.








Abstract
Binders play a pivotal role in the performance of sodium‐ion battery (SIB) cathodes, but traditional binders often struggle to balance broad compatibility, high ionic conductivity, superior binding strength, and environmental sustainability. In this study, a universal cellulose triacetate (TAC)‐based binder (TAC‐MMT) composed of TAC and natural montmorillonite (MMT) is designed to facilitate rapid Na+ transport pathways and establish a robust hydrogen‐bonding network. This innovative TAC‐MMT binder features a unique chemical structure that achieves high ionic conductivity through a self‐enrichment and fast‐transport mechanism, while its superior binding strength is attributed to hydrogen‐bonding crosslinks between proton acceptors (C═O) in TAC and proton donors (−OH) in MMT. More importantly, the outstanding solubility and film‐forming properties of TAC‐MMT contribute to stable electrode protection and broad compatibility with high‐voltage SIB cathodes. Benefiting from these advantages, the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) electrodes with the TAC‐MMT binder demonstrate exceptional performance, including a high capacity retention of 95.2% over 500 cycles at 5C and a rapid rate response of up to 15C. The versatility of the TAC‐MMT binder is further confirmed with high‐voltage NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 and Na0.61[Mn0.27Fe0.34Ti0.39]O2 cathodes. This study highlights the potential of biomass‐based binders as a sustainable and effective solution for advancing high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of engineering modification strategies for ruthenium (Ru)‐based catalysts, highlighting their critical role in optimizing electronic structures and surface properties to enhance electrocatalytic conversion. Furthermore, it emphasizes the integration of multiple engineering strategies aimed at improving catalytic performance, while also addressing key commercialization challenges.








Abstract
Electrochemical conversion has been regarded as an ideal technology for achieving clean and sustainable energy, showing significant promise in addressing the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution. Ru‐containing electrocatalysts (RUCE) outperform other precious metals due to elevated intrinsic activity and superior cost‐effectiveness, developing into a promising candidate for electrochemical conversion reactions. A significant challenge in the field of catalyst discovery lies in its heavy reliance on empirical methods, rather than approaches that are rooted in rational design principles. This review first concentrates on the catalytically active sites and critical factors governing catalytic activity and performance durability. Then, a comprehensive summary of multifunctional modification strategies ranging from nanoscale to atomic scale is explored to control the structure and improve the performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A Bi‐based catalyst is developed via the electrochemical transformation of bismuth‐oxide composites, inducing enhanced lattice strain to optimize catalytic performance. At an applied potential of −0.76 V versus RHE, the catalyst exhibits outstanding efficiency in glycine electrosynthesis, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 79.1% and a record‐high glycine concentration of 0.17 m, significantly outperforming conventional Bi‐based systems. Moreover, the introduction of glycolaldehyde and hydroxylamine as reactants further elevate the glycine FE to 91.3%, with an impressive production rate of 2433.3 µmol h−1 under identical conditions.








Abstract
Glycine plays a crucial role in various industrial and daily applications. However, traditional synthesis methods are often associated with high toxicity, energy intensity, and inefficiency. This study introduces an efficient and eco‐friendly method for synthesizing glycine via the reductive coupling of oxalic acid and nitrate using a Bi metal catalyst, enhanced by lattice strain from Bi and oxide composites undergoing electrochemical transformation. At an applied potential of −0.76 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the Bi catalyst achieves an impressive glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 79.1%, yielding a record concentration of 0.17 m, substantially higher than conventional Bi‐based systems. Furthermore, the introduction of glycolaldehyde and hydroxylamine as reactants raise the glycine FE to 91.3% with a production rate of 2433.3 µmol h−1 under identical conditions. Electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations demonstrate that lattice expansion notably boosts glycine synthesis by facilitating NH2OH formation and promoting the efficient reduction of oxime intermediates. These results underscore the significance of lattice engineering in enhancing active site performance and accelerating reaction kinetics, offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional glycine synthesis methods.

<title>Simultaneous Heavy‐Metal Ion Adsorption and Electricity Generation From Wastewater via “Heavy‐Metal Removal Batteries”</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202503776?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A heavy‐metal removal battery is designed, which displays the capacity of simultaneous heavy‐metal ion adsorption and electricity generation. In such battery, the heavy‐metal ion adsorption is driven by the potential difference between adsorption electrodes and metal electrodes. Furthermore, a chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy‐metal ions from adsorption electrodes, achieving the recycling of the electrodes.








Abstract
The heavy‐metal ion in wastewater is a great threat to the health of both humans and ecosystems. The common heavy‐metal ion removal strategies usually suffer from energy consumption and poor recyclability. Herein, a heavy‐metal removal battery is designed by constructing a two‐chamber configuration. Such battery displays the capacity of simultaneous heavy‐metal ion adsorption and electricity output, where heavy‐metal ion adsorption is driven by the potential difference between adsorption electrodes and metal electrodes, and electricity is generated continuously during the adsorption process. Significantly, various heavy‐metal ions (e.g., Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cr3+ and Pb2+ ions) can be removed due to the large lattice spacing of active materials in adsorption electrodes, displaying the universality of adsorbing heavy‐metal ions from wastewater. In addition, an environmental‐friendly chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy‐metal ions from adsorption electrodes, which not only produces high‐quality metal salts, but also reduces the toxicity of sludge in the case of secondary pollution. Impressively, these heavy‐metal removal batteries can be easily scaled up and integrated to extend the heavy‐metal ion adsorption ability and voltage/current output. This work proves a creative approach for simultaneous heavy‐metal ion removal and electricity generation from wastewater.

The TOC illustrates Cs₃Cu₂Br₅, Cs₃Cu₂Cl₅, and double perovskite suspensions, the 3D‐printed “MIZZOU” text under 325 nm laser excitation, the corresponding emission spectra of the color conversion layer, and the CIE 1976 (u', v') color space of the fabricated white LED.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites and their derivatives have emerged as highly promising materials for next‐generation optoelectronic devices, owing to their intrinsic defect tolerance and exceptional electrical and optical properties. Among these, lead‐free copper(I)‐based halide perovskite derivatives, Cs₃Cu₂X₅ (X = Cl, Br, I) (CHPs), have garnered significant attention as environmentally friendly and stable alternatives to lead‐based perovskites. In this study, a cost‐effective and sustainable synthesis route for Cs₃Cu₂Cl₅ and Cs₃Cu₂Br₅ powders is developed, which exhibit strong green (≈526 nm) and blue (≈458 nm) emissions, and achieve remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 100% and 92%, respectively. Cs₃Cu₂X₅ (X = Cl, Br) powders are incorporated into 3D‐printed structures, exhibiting excellent transparency and color stability. Furthermore, white LEDs are fabricated by using the green‐emitting Cs₃Cu₂Cl₅ and blue‐emitting Cs₃Cu₂Br₅ and a yellow‐emitting double perovskite (PLQY≈ 73%), resulting in devices with an exceptionally high color rendering index (CRI) of up to 98 and tunable correlated color temperatures (CCTs) ranging from 3864 to 9677 K, closely mimicking natural white light. Beyond solid‐state lighting, the superior optical performance and stability of Cs₃Cu₂X₅ (X = Cl, Br) powders open new avenues for their application in photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices.

<title>Enabling High Performance in a Positive Potential of Nitrate‐to‐Ammonia Electrocatalysis Over Mesoporous Core@Shell Cu2O/Cu@PdCu Nanozyme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Mesoporous core@shell Cu2O/Cu@PdCu nanozymes are demonstrated as efficient tandem electrocatalyst for highly selective NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3− at fairly positive potentials. Meanwhile, this enzyme‐like electrocatalyst performs perfectly in the two‐electrode coupling system for cathode NO3−‐to‐NH3 and anode ethanol oxidation in a more energy‐efficient manner.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic tandem nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3−‐to‐NH3) offers a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. Although considerable efforts have been presented to modulate the reaction pathways for enhanced NO3−‐to‐NH3 electrocatalysis, these advances often require relatively high overpotentials to balance yield rate and selectivity of NH3, resulting in a remarkable energy inefficiency. Inspired by enzyme catalysis in nature, herein a tandem enzyme‐like electrocatalyst is designed consisting of a core of Cu2O/Cu heterojunction surrounded by mesoporous PdCu shell (Cu2O/Cu@mesoPdCu) that accelerated NO3−‐to‐NH3 electrocatalysis in positive potentials. Impressively, Cu2O/Cu@mesoPdCu nanozymes hold superior performance for robust NH3 electrosynthesis in a fairly positive potential of 0.10 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode), having Faraday efficiency of 96.2%, yield rate of 13.3 mg h−1 mg−1, and half‐cell energy efficiency of 46.0%. Kinetic studies, in situ spectra and density functional theory calculations revealed that Cu2O/Cu core preferentially adsorbed NO3− and further reduced to *NO2, while active hydrogen radicals enriched on PdCu shell promoted multistep hydrodeoxygenation of *NO2 to NH3 within “semi‐closed” mesoporous microenvironment, both of which synergistically enabled tandem electrocatalysis in positive potentials. Moreover, this enzyme‐like electrocatalyst disclosed better NO3−‐to‐NH3 performance in a more energy‐efficient manner when coupling with more thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation reaction.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Residue‐free 2D materials with exceptional cleanliness and high quality are achieved using van der Waals interaction‐based fabrication and manipulation techniques, completely free from polymers and solvents. Precise manipulation enables the construction of vdW heterostructures with controlled alignment, expanding the potential of 2D materials for next‐generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
2D materials have garnered considerable attention due to their distinctive properties, prompting diverse applications across various domains. Beyond their inherent qualities, the significance of 2D materials extends into the fabrication processes that can lead to the degradation of intrinsic performance through undesirable mechanical defects and surface contaminations. Herein, a novel fabrication technique to achieve residue‐free 2D materials using van der Waals (vdW) interactions, primarily employing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is proposed. Optical and electrical characterizations confirm the absence of residues, mechanical defects, oxidation, and strain, along with a prominent field‐effect mobility of up to 60 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of ≈108. Furthermore, the utilization of residue‐free material as a stamp enables various manipulations of flakes transferred on substrates in advance, including pick‐up and release, stacking, exfoliation, wiping‐out, flipping, and smoothing‐out processes. Additionally, the manipulation techniques also facilitate the fabrication of vdW heterostructures with precise positioning and the desired stacking order. In this regard, the feasibility of applying this method to hexagonal boron nitride and graphite is demonstrated. It is expected that this method will offer a versatile and effective approach to enhancing the qualities of 2D material‐based electronic and optoelectronic devices.

<title>Electric Field‐Induced Dual‐Gradient Heterojunction Diodes Toward Ultrasensitive Self‐Powered Ionic Skin</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A universal strategy for constructing ultrasensitive self‐powered sensing materials with dual‐gradient heterojunctions is developed through the induction of anionic and cationic polymer gradient distribution under direct current electric field.








Abstract
The hydrogel ionic diode is regarded as a promising self‐powered sensor, capable of harvesting energy from low‐frequency stimuli human motions and converting it into electrical signals. However, the sensitivity of the reported conventional bilayer hydrogel ionic diodes are relatively low, due to the single heterojunction interface and high interface resistance, making it challenging to meet the demands of high‐precision sensing. Here, a universal method for fabricating dual‐gradient hydrogel ionic diodes without bilayer structure through the induction of anionic and cationic polymer gradient distribution via a direct current electric field is developed. Due to the dual‐gradient distribution, numerous heterogeneous microstructures (i.e., microdiodes) with low interface resistance are formed in the bulk phase of hydrogel, and these series‐connected microdiodes demonstrate a significantly increase in open circuit voltage in response to mechanical pressure. The dual‐gradient hydrogel ionic diode exhibits ultra‐high sensitivity (1247.3 mV/MPa) and ultralow detection limit (0.8 Pa), enabling the smart prosthetic hand to non‐destructive grasp ultrasoft tofu. This work is expected to pave the way for novel high‐precision self‐powered sensors in intelligent wearable electronics.

Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium‐ion (NH₄⁺)—including cost‐effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics—aqueous NH₄⁺ batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic‐inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting‐edge aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium‐ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next‐generation large‐scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost‐effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH4+ diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH4+ exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li+, Na+, and K+. Therefore, unlocking the NH4+‐ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high‐performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting‐edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium‐ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH4+ ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic‐inorganic hybrids in AAIBs. Lastly, the review addresses the key challenges and future perspectives of organic‐material‐based AAIBs, aiming to push the boundaries of cutting‐edge aqueous energy storage systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Liquid‐phase transmission electron microscopy enables visualization of nanoscale processes involving liquid media. Yet, it suffers from beam effects, such as radiolysis of the liquid, sample heating, and membrane charging. This review summarizes beam effect fundamentals, describes modeling and assessment, and illustrates handling strategies. The findings are transferable to other ionizing radiation techniques using, for example, γ‐ or X‐rays.








Abstract
The ionizing radiation harnessed in electron microscopes or synchrotrons enables unique insights into nanoscale dynamics. In liquid‐phase transmission electron microscopy (LP‐TEM), irradiating a liquid sample with electrons offers access to real space information at an unmatched combination of temporal and spatial resolution. However, employing ionizing radiation for imaging can alter the Gibbs free energy landscape during the experiment. This is mainly due to radiolysis and the corresponding shift in chemical potential; however, experiments can also be affected by irradiation‐induced charging and heating. In this review, the state of the art in describing beam effects is summarized, theoretical and experimental assessment guidelines are provided, and strategies to obtain quantitative information under such conditions are discussed. While this review showcases these effects on LP‐TEM, the concepts that are discussed here can also be applied to other types of ionizing radiation used to probe liquid samples, such as synchrotron X‐rays.

<title>Eliminating Radioresistance With a Magnetic Ion‐Generator by Simultaneously Augmenting DNA Damage and Diminishing Immunosuppression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Traditional medicine has encountered certain bottlenecks in dealing with radioresistance. To address this, a “three birds with one stone” strategy based on the constructed radioresistance model is developed. This innovative magnetic ion‐generator can not only release Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions to induce ferroptosis and activate the STING pathway, enhancing DNA damage synergistically with radiotherapy, but it can also modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment effectively, thereby reversing radioresistance.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) hinges on DNA damage‐induced cancer cell death and the subsequent anti‐tumor immunity. However, the efficacy of RT is curtailed by cell cycle heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which foster radioresistance. Here an ion generator‐based RT enhancement strategy is demonstrated in a mouse model of the radioresistant tumor. The ion generator is degraded in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in iron‐triggered ferroptosis that enhanced immunogenic cell death and a manganese‐activated stimulator of interferon gene that reversed the immunosuppressive environment. As a result, the proposed strategy promotes dendritic cells maturity, augmentes CD8+ T cell infiltration of tumors, suppresses intratumoral myeloid‐derived suppressor cells, and limits the M2 macrophages polarization, indicating the formation of an immunoreactive microenvironment. Significantly, this approach impedes the growth of not just primary, but also distal metastatic tumors. It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.

Hybrid MXenes (h‐MXenes) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides with amino surface groups that exhibit interesting optical properties. The sensitivity of the organic material under high‐energy electron beams complicates conventional TEM analysis. Using cryogenic STEM, we show h‐MXenes are stable until a critical dose threshold. Beyond that threshold, the in situ generation of ripplocations is observed.









Abstract
Inorganic–organic hybrid MXenes (h‐MXenes) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides functionalized with alkylimido and alkylamido surface groups. Using cryogenic and room temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy‐loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is shown that ripplocations, a form of a fundamental defect in 2D and layered structures, are abundant in this family of materials. Furthermore, detailed studies of electron probe sample interactions, focusing on structural deformations caused by the electron beam are presented. The findings indicate that at cryogenic temperatures (≈100 K) and below a specific dose threshold, the structure of h‐MXenes remains largely intact. However, exceeding this threshold leads to electron beam‐induced deformation through ripplocations. Interestingly, the deformation behavior, required dose, and resultant structure are highly dependent on temperature. At 100 K, it is demonstrated that the electron beam can induce ripplocations in situ with a high degree of precision.

Polyamines have tantalized cancer researchers as a potential means to rein in the rampant growth of cancer cells. However, clinical trials in recent decades have disappointed in delivering notable progress. Herein, a microfluidic‐assisted synthetic hydrogen‐bond organic framework (HOF) as a polyamine‐depleting nanoplatforms designed to unleash the vigor of both dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells for precision cancer immunotherapy is reported. Upon internalization by tumor cells, the loaded plasma amine oxidase (PAO) in HOF efficiently depletes polyamines, remolding the tumor microenvironment and alleviating T‐cell immunosuppression. This process also generates acrolein and H2O2, triggering CRISPR‐assisted neoantigen generation. Specifically, Acrolein induces carbonyl stress, increasing mutational burdens. Simultaneously, HOF leverages the energy from the bis[2,4,5‐trichloro‐6‐(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO)‐H2O2 reaction for CRET‐triggered singlet oxygen production, leading to thioether bond cleavage and release CRISPR‐Cas9. Once released, CRISPR‐Cas9 knocks out the DNA mismatch repair (MMR)‐related MLH1 gene, further elevating mutational burdens and generating neoantigens, ideal targets for DCs. This dual‐action strategy not only corrects T‐cell immunosuppression but also enhances DC efficacy, presenting a powerful approach for tumor immunotherapy.

A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior Q factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.








Abstract
In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3 THz frequency with a record‐high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high‐dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes. The screening of up to 15 cancer cells is experimentally reported, with very high detecting accuracy of 93.33% and with attractive quantitative concentration sensitivity up to 1320 kHz cell mL−1. This hyperspectral metachips are low‐cost, highly compact, and label‐free for fast, high‐throughput and high‐sensitivity detections and evaluation of human cancer cells. This technology does not require clinical experience, representing an accessible technology for early diagnosis of cancer.

<title>An Integrated Virtual Screening Platform to Identify Potent Co‐Assembled Nanodrugs for Cancer Treatment</title>

This work uses ligand‐based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct a high‐throughput screening platform, which can be used to identify small molecule combinations with potential co‐assembly ability.








Abstract
Co‐assembled nanodrugs provide significant advantages in cancer treatment and drug delivery, yet effective screening methods to identify molecular combinations for co‐assembly are lacking. This study presents a screening strategy integrating ligand‐based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore new molecular combinations with co‐assembly capabilities. The accuracy of this screening was validated by synthesizing various co‐assembled nanodrugs under mild conditions. Vinpocetine (Vin) and lenvatinib (Len) are representative co‐assembly combinations that can directly co‐assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and π‐π interactions. These NPs were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in PEG‐L/V NPs that exhibited enhanced stability and biocompatibility. In addition, PEG‐L/V NPs can respond to acidic conditions and release Vin and Len, working synergistically to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro while also inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) analysis revealed that the co‐assembled nanodrugs exhibited mechanisms that are distinct from those of single drugs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a computational approach combining LBVS and DFT to identify small molecules with co‐assembly capabilities, leading to innovative anticancer strategies.

<title>Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.








Abstract
Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field. The theoretical and experimental results for electric conduction can directly be transferred to thermal conduction or particle diffusion and may enable remote sensing applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Efficient storage and retrieval of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) data while maintaining scalability and stability remain challenges in the field of molecular data storage. This study introduces Engineered Living Memory Microspheroids (ELMMs), which combine genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) with matrix materials for DNA storage. The ELMM system improves random access and reduces data encapsulation time, offering scalable, closed‐loop storage and reuse.








Abstract
Given its exceptional durability and high information density, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has the potential to meet the escalating global demand for data storage if it can be stored efficiently and accessed randomly in exabyte‐to‐yottabyte‐scale databases. Here, this work introduces the Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid (ELMM) as a novel material for DNA data storage, retrieval, and management. This work engineers a plasmid library and devises a random access strategy pairing plasmid function with DNA data in a key‐value format. Each DNA segment is integrated with its corresponding plasmid, introduced into bacteria, and encapsulated within matrix material via droplet microfluidics within 5 min. ELMMs can be stored at room temperature following lyophilization and, upon rehydration, each type of ELMM exhibits specific functions expressed by the plasmids, allowing for physical differentiation based on these characteristics. This work demonstrates fluorescent expression as the plasmid function and employs fluorescence‐based sorting access image files in a prototype database. By utilizing N optical channels, to retrieve 2N file types, each with a minimum of 10 copies. ELMM offers a digital‐to‐biological information solution, ensuring the preservation, access, replication, and management of files within large‐scale DNA databases.

<title>Organic Gradient Homojunction via D‐A Engineering Enables Photoelectric/Photothermal Dual‐Assisted Catalysis Toward Full Spectrum Light‐Coupled Low‐Temperature Seawater Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An organic gradient homojunction design via rational donor–acceptor engineering is proposed to establish a new class of full‐spectrum responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode for solar‐coupled seawater‐electrolyte‐based metal‐air flow batteries with improved solar utilization and device energy efficiency even at lower temperatures, by exploring photoelectric/photothermal dual‐assisted bidirectional oxygen catalysis.








Abstract
Coupling solar into metal‐air batteries represents an appealing paradigm for storing intermittent solar energy and boosting device energy efficiency. Current solar‐coupled metal‐air systems rely on UV or visible light harvesting and suffer from inferior charge separation ability and limited solar utilization. Additionally, sunlight action behavior/mechanism in some useful scenarios (seawater electrolytes, low‐temperature) is underexplored. Herein, through gradient homojunction design via donor‐acceptor (D‐A) engineering, it exploits a novel full‐spectrum‐responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode (PGH) for sunlight‐coupled seawater‐electrolyte‐based Zn/Na‐air batteries (Zn‐SWAB/Na‐SWAB) with boosted sunlight utilization and energy efficiency at lower temperatures. By stacking three pre‐designed analogous [A1‐D1]m‐[A1‐D2]n copolymers with gradient energy‐levels and rich heterocycles, PGH integrates separate metal‐free active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), efficient photothermal effect with full‐spectrum‐absorption, and superior photoelectric effect with high charge‐separation efficiency. Thus, PGH under simulated‐sunlight produces remarkably‐enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near‐neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight‐coupled PGH‐enabled Zn‐SWAB and Na‐SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25 V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43 V at 0 °C – both of which surpass most reported room‐temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0 °C even approach their room‐temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual‐promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.

<title>Lab‐in‐Cell: A Covalent Photosensitizer Reverses Hypoxia and Evokes Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti‐Tumor Immunity</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The covalent warhead alkynamide is incorporated into an aggregation‐induced emission photosensitizer, developing a redox systems‐targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP‐PA. It is aimed at disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system, alleviating hypoxia, and evoking ferroptosis‐ and pyroptosis‐mediated immunotherapy by thiol‐yne click reactions. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP‐PA‐NPs at the tumor led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non‐invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor‐associated antigens and damage‐associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP‐PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis‐ and pyroptosis‐mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol‐yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non‐covalent photosensitizer MBTP‐A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti‐tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP‐PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol‐yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.

<title>Generating Self‐Adjuvated Nanofiber Vaccines by Coating Bacterial Flagella with Antigens</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Coating bacterial flagella with antigens is used as a versatile platform for developing self‐adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. The resulting flagellum‐based subunit vaccines with appealing features in prolonging tumor retention, recruiting adequate immune cells, and promoting cellular uptake of antigens and subsequent activation of antigen‐presenting cells provide a unique paradigm for effective vaccination.








Abstract
Bacteria‐based vaccines have received increasing attention given the ability to induce strong systemic immune responses. However, the application of bacteria as therapeutic agents inevitably suffers from infection‐associated side effects due to the living characteristics. Here, the use of bacteria‐derived flagella is described to construct self‐adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. With the help of charge‐reversal mediated by decoration with cationic polymers, the flagella can be coated with negatively charged antigens through electrostatic interaction. By virtue of the large aspect ratio, the resulting nanofiber vaccines show prolonged retention at the injection site and increased uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. Thanks to the innate immunogenicity, self‐adjuvated flagella robustly promote dendritic cell maturation and macrophage polarization, resulting in the elicitation of antigen‐specific T‐cell and B‐cell immune responses. In ovalbumin‐overexpressing melanoma‐bearing mice, immunization with ovalbumin‐carried vaccines not only exhibits a favorable tolerance, but also displays superior inhibition efficacies on tumor growth and metastasis separately under the therapeutic and prophylactic settings. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated for vaccine fabrication by coating with the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein S1 subunit. Bacterial flagella‐based self‐adjuvated nanofiber platform proposes a versatile strategy to develop various vaccines for disease prevention and treatment.

<title>Giant and Anisotropic Enhancement of Spin‐Charge Conversion in Graphene‐Based Quantum System</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
New magnetic Fe/Graphene/Pt double Rashba interface displays record spin‐charge current interconversion efficiency at room temperature. The effect, which is anisotropic along the Γ‐K and Γ‐M directions, arises from the Direct and Inverse Edelstein mechanism in this new quantum epitaxial heterostructure.








Abstract
The ever‐increasing demand for efficient data storage and processing has fueled the search for novel memory devices. By exploiting the spin‐to‐charge conversion phenomena, spintronics promises faster and low power solutions alternative to conventional electronics. In this work, a remarkable 34‐fold increase in spin‐to‐charge current conversion is demonstrated when incorporating a 2D epitaxial graphene monolayer between iron and platinum layers by exploring spin‐pumping on‐chip devices. Furthermore, it is found that the spin conversion is also anisotropic. This enhancement and anisotropy is attributed to the asymmetric Rashba contributions driven by an unbalanced spin accumulation at the differently hybridized top and bottom graphene interfaces, as highlighted by ad‐hoc first‐principles theory. The improvement in spin‐to‐charge conversion as well as its anisotropy reveals the importance of interfaces in hybrid 2D‐thin film systems, opening up new possibilities for engineering spin conversion in 2D materials, leading to potential advances in memory, logic applications, or unconventional computing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A grid‐like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist‐induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g−1 at 1 A g−1). It enables the as‐assembled supercapacitor with an ultra‐high energy density of 675 Wh kg−1 in KI‐mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine‐containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid‐like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist‐induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as‐fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g−1 at 1 A g−1) and enables the as‐assembled supercapacitor with an ultra‐high energy density of 675 Wh kg−1 in redox‐active electrolyte (KI‐mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro‐activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox‐active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application‐inspired cutting‐edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

<title>Self‐Manipulating Sodium Ion Gradient‐Based Endogenic Electrical Stimulation Dressing for Wound Repair</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self‐manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non‐invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self‐manipulating sodium ion gradient‐based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig‐EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non‐invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig‐EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig‐EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+‐ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig‐EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury‐associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig‐EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

A material‐device‐algorithm co‐design strategy integrates an OFET array with in‐sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e‐noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material‐device‐algorithm co‐design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field‐effect transistor (OFET) array with in‐sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k‐nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs—among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e‐noses.

Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80 cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

<title>A PD‐L1 siRNA‐Loaded Boron Nanoparticle for Targeted Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A PD‐L1 siRNA‐loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD‐L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD‐L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD‐L1 inhibits intracellular PD‐L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT‐induced DNA damage but also maximizing T‐cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT‐immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B‐containing polymer that self‐assembled with PD‐L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD‐L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT‐immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD‐L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD‐L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T‐cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT‐induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD‐L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

<title>2D Biomimetic Membranes Constructed by Charge Assembly and Hydrogen Bonding for Precise Ion Separation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well‐ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long‐term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer‐by‐layer self‐assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl‐binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high‐affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of ≈140 and ≈40, respectively, while maintaining long‐term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high‐performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low‐cost self‐accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent‐free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self‐healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self‐accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low‐cost, and large‐scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent‐free, vacuum‐free, and low‐temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self‐accelerated synthesis is driven by the self‐generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self‐healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o‐substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol‐functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as‐prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self‐accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low‐cost, and large‐scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial‐scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post‐treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high‐value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA‐K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high‐performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403 mA cm⁻2 at 1.40 V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA‐K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA‐K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial‐scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320 g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H₂, yielding 1200 g of AA‐K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A comprehensive system‐level neural network‐assisted end‐to‐end design framework of meta‐optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual‐polarization multi‐wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi‐wavelength‐depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non‐orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized‐spectral multi‐information processing.








Abstract
Meta‐optics, with unique light‐matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi‐parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano‐structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high‐performance full‐light field control. Here, a neural network‐assisted end‐to‐end design framework that facilitates global, gradient‐based optimization of multifunctional meta‐optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi‐wavelength‐polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., ≈6 × structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full‐parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri‐polarization multi‐wavelength‐depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non‐orthogonal polarizations (>3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized‐spectral multi‐information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta‐optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next‐generation intelligent optical technologies.

<title>Diluted Ternary Heterojunctions to Suppress Charge Recombination for Organic Solar Cells with 21% Efficiency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Diluted heterojunctions are employed to increase the structure order in the layer‐by‐layer fabricated solar cells and polymeric diluent is found superior that the small molecular diluent, creating OSC having dual fibrils with significantly increased absorption and reduced charge recombination to realize an efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%).








Abstract
As an exitonic photovoltaic device, organic solar cells (OSCs) consist of electron donating and accepting components in their photoactive layer, in which the molecular interactions between donor and acceptor can significantly affect the nanoscale morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. In this work, by diluting electron donor with electron acceptor having opposite electrostatic potentials to promote the structural order via strengthened intermolecular interactions, this study shows that polymeric diluent is more effective due to its long‐ranged conjugated backbone compared with small molecular diluent. The ternary heterojunction made of C5‐16:L8‐BO binary acceptors diluted with D18 shows the strongest structural order, benefiting from the strong interactions between L8‐BO and C5‐16. The enhanced structural order within the photoactive layer prepared by layer‐by‐layer deposition of the diluted p‐type and n‐type heterojunctions contributes to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transport, and inhibited charge recombination. As the result, OSC based on D18 (PY‐IT diluted)/L8‐BO:C5‐16 (D18 diluted) having donor and acceptor dual fibrils obtains an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%), which is one of the highest certified PCE up to date.

<title>Stochastically Broken Inversion Symmetry of Van der Waals Topological Insulator for Nanoscale Physically Unclonable Functions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
vdW Janus topological insulator is presented with stochastic inversion asymmetry via penetrative single‐step plasma sulfurization, which enables the large‐scale synthesis, one‐step process, and low‐temperature condition with back‐end‐of‐line process compatibility. Sulfur dominance and its corresponding spatial OOP domain distribution are spatially observed using piezoelectric force microscopy hysteresis mapping, cross‐sectional transmission electron microscopy, top‐view scanning electroc microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and force‐distance curve mapping. This provides an extendable synthetic solution for stochastic and size‐controllable challenge‐response pairs generation for PUFs application, which can overcome the conventional limitations of encryption technology.








Abstract
Owing to the exotic state of quantum matter, topological insulators have emerged as a significant platform for new‐generation functional devices. Among these topological insulators, tetradymites have received significant attention because of their van der Waals (vdW) structures and inversion symmetries. Although this inversion symmetry completely blocks exotic quantum phenomena, it should be broken down to facilitate versatile topological functionalities. Recently, a Janus structure is suggested for asymmetric out‐of‐plane lattice structures, terminating the heterogeneous atoms at two sides of the vdW structure. However, the synthesis of Janus structures has not been achieved commercially because of the imprecise control of the layer‐by‐layer growth, high‐temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, plasma sulfurization of vdW topological insulators has been presented, enabling stochastic inversion asymmetry. To take practical advantage of the random lattice distortion, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been suggested as applications of vdW Janus topological insulators. The sulfur dominance is experimentally demonstrated via X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hysteresis variation, cross‐sectional transmission electron microscopy, and adhesion energy variation. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the vdW Janus topological insulators can provide an extendable encryption platform for randomized lattice distortion, offering on‐demand stochastic inversion asymmetry via a single‐step plasma sulfurization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance‐area product by integrating chemically vapor‐deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin‐orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy‐efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high‐performance spintronics but also paves the way for next‐generation low‐power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin‐orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field‐free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT‐memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor‐deposited two‐dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non‐volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect, achieving a low resistance‐area product (RA) of 15.5 kΩ·µm2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low‐power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti‐parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT‐memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT‐memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT‐memory with PMA field‐free switching.

Ultrathin‐conjugated MOFs nanosheets with single‐crystalline characteristics are prepared by surfactant‐assisted solution synthesis strategy. The π–π stacked MOF/graphene van der Waals heterostructure can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode‐locking with femtosecond pulse duration and high‐order harmonic mode‐locking with GHz repetition frequency. This preferable stacking exhibits superior π‐conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their outstanding characteristics. However, due to the strong interlayer π–π stacking interactions, the preparation of high‐quality and atomic‐scale single‐crystalline conjugated MOF structures continues to pose a significant challenge. The investigation of its nonlinear optical (NLO) property and application for ultrafast photonics is still rare. Herein, the ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 and Ni3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11‐hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single‐crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant‐assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the π–π stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG‐VHS and NiNsG‐VHS) are achieved by ultrasound‐assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior π‐conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third‐order NLO polarizability of CuNsG‐VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near‐infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG‐VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode‐locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high‐order harmonic mode‐locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Full‐color carbon dots (FCDs) with emission wavelengths ranging from 434 to 703 nm are synthesized using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the sole precursor. The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and gain performance of the FCDs are enhanced due to cross‐linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Tunable liquid‐state laser emissions in green, yellow, red, and NIR regions are achieved with lower laser thresholds compared to RhB, demonstrating superior laser stability. Additionally, these FCDs are validated as excellent laser sources. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirmed that FCDs exhibit significantly lower toxicity and superior staining effects compared to RhB.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) serve as a novel, non‐toxic, cost‐effective, and highly‐stable solution‐processable nanolaser material. However, compared to commonly used commercial laser dyes, CDs exhibit lower photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), radiation transition rates, and gain coefficients. Consequently, this leads to higher laser thresholds that significantly impede the expansion of practical applications for CDs. Therefore, enhancing the gain performance of CDs is crucial in guiding the design of CD gain materials and promoting their practical applications. Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full‐color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B‐CDs, G‐CDs, Y‐CDs, R‐CDs, and NIR‐CDs) fluorescence through cross‐linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703 nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross‐linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.

Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in‐sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire‐induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two‐order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization‐based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in‐sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In‐sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in‐sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric‐reconfigurable polarization‐sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in‐sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non‐volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state‐of‐the‐art polarization‐sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road‐scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work reveals for the first time the underlying mechanism of vacancies in TOMEs and uncovers the effect of atomic‐scale polarization on the redox reaction mechanism through in situ Raman and operando ATR‐SEIRAS. Further, the stability of cation/anion vacancies is explored in long‐term cycling. The findings standardize the fundamentals governing the utility and evolution of vacancies, thereby opening new avenues for a variety of sustainable energy storage schemes.








Abstract
Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts (TMOEs) are poised to revive grid‐scale all‐vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) due to their low‐cost and unique electronic properties, while often inescapably harboring surface vacancies. The role of local vacancy‐induced physicochemical properties on vanadium‐redox electrochemistry (VRE), encompassing kinetics, and stability, remains profoundly unveiled. Herein, for the first time, it is revealed that vacancies induce atomic‐scale polarization in TMOEs and elucidate its mechanism in VRE. Attributable to local polarization, particularly by cation vacancy, the activated nearest‐coordinated Mn sites prominently augment the adsorption competence of the V2+/V3+ couple and expedite its round‐tripping by forming an intermediate *Mn–O–V bridge. It is also affirmed that the anion vacancies are vulnerable to microstructure reconfiguration by feeble hydroxyl adsorption and thus performance degradation over long‐term cycling, in contrast to cation vacancies. Accordingly, the VRFB employing cation‐vacancy‐functionalized electrode delivers an energy efficiency of 80.8% and a reliable 1000‐cycle lifespan with a negligible decay of 0.57% per cycle at 300 mA cm−2, outclassing others. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in TMOEs, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A geometric isomerization strategy is reported to modulate the electron and energy states of metal‐free COF‐based catalysts via introducing bithiophene units featuring diverse substitutions. The asymmetric 2,3‐substitution COFs with enhanced dipole moment and non‐uniform charge distribution show high electrocatalytic activity, with the pentacyclic‐carbon (thiophene β‐position) far from sulfur atoms emerging as active sites.








Abstract
Embedding isomer entities onto crystalline frameworks with precisely defined spatial distributions represents a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, accurately constructing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate energy state effectively remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative geometric isomerization strategy aimed at minimizing the rotational barrier energy (ΔE), average local ionization energy (ALIE), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for ORR within COFs is proposed. Based on this strategy, isomeric Py‐COF‐αα with 2,2‐substitution, Py‐COF‐ββ with 3,3‐substitution, and Py‐COF‐αβ with 2,3‐substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, Py‐COF‐αβ with lower ΔE between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half‐wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal‐free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non‐uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic‐carbon (thiophene β‐position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An etchless bound‐state‐in‐the‐continuum polymer cavity is designed on a 2D InSe flake, achieving an impressive photoluminescence enhancement of 218 times. The exciton‐exciton scattering in InSe is intensively amplified on cavity, which is unobservable off‐cavity. Second harmonic generation in InSe can also be significantly enhanced by 404 times. The etchless cavity concept can be extended to other nanostructures beyond grating.








Abstract
Recently, fervent research interest is sparked to indium selenide (γ‐InSe) due to its dazzling optical and electronic properties. The direct bandgap in the near‐infrared (NIR) range ensures efficient carrier recombination in InSe, promoting impressive competency for lavish NIR applications. Nevertheless, the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of InSe is significantly limited by out‐of‐plane (OP) excitons, adverse to practical devices. Herein, a facile and effective solution is proposed by introducing photonic bound‐states‐in‐the‐continuum (BIC) modes to enhance excitons in InSe through strengthened exciton‐photon coupling. This cavity is constructed simply by patterning a polymer grating onto the InSe flake without an etching process, achieving an impressive PL enhancement of over 200 times. By adjusting the cavity resonance wavelength, it can selectively amplify the exciton emission or the exciton‐exciton scattering process, which is not observable off‐cavity at room temperature. Additionally, the second harmonic generation (SHG) process in InSe can also be largely enhanced by over 400 times on the cavity. Notably, the etchless cavity design can be further extended to other nanostructures beyond grating. This research presents a feasible and efficient approach to enhancing the optical performance of OP excitons, paving a prospective avenue for advanced linear and nonlinear photonic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A type of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) has been developed, demonstrating the loading of mitochondria and self‐enclosure processes to ensure the protection of mitochondrial transport via the bloodstream. The treatment with ACs effectively transplanted mitochondria around the lesion, thereby improving neurological recovery by supporting microglia immunological homeostasis after intracerebral hemorrhage.








Abstract
The immune‐inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro‐inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain. Here, a novel strategy for mitochondrial transplantation via intravenous injection of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) are proposed. ACs can protect the loaded mitochondria and selectively accumulate around the lesion under an external magnetic field (EMF). In this study, mitochondria released from ACs can effectively improve microglial mitochondrial function, attenuate their pro‐inflammatory attributes, and elevate the proportion of immunosuppressive microglia. In this way, microglia immune homeostasis in the brain is reestablished, and inflammation is attenuated, ultimately promoting functional recovery. This study presents an effective approach to transplant mitochondria into the brain, offering a promising alternative to modulate the immune‐inflammatory cascade in the brain following ICH.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hydrogen spillover is considered to play a major role in ubiquitous technologies involving hydrogen. However, its application in Earth‐abundant widely‐used non‐reducible oxides is severely limited by much shorter migration distances of atomic hydrogen compared to those in reducible oxides. This study presents a surface hydroxyl modulation strategy to enhance hydrogen migration over nonreducible oxides, promoting electrocatalytic hydrogenation for water purification.








Abstract
The migration of atomic hydrogen species over heterogeneous catalysts is deemed essential for hydrogenation reactions, a process closely related to the catalyst's functionalities. While surface hydroxyls‐assisted hydrogen spillover is well documented on reducible oxide supports, its effect on widely‐used nonreducible supports, especially in electrocatalytic reactions with water as the hydrogen source, remains a subject of debate. Herein, a nonreducible oxide‐anchored copper single‐atom catalyst (Cu1/SiO2) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO2 can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu1/SiO2 catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu1/SiO2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen‐species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.

Abstract
Osteoporosis is a widespread condition that induces an inflammatory microenvironment, limiting the effectiveness of conventional therapies and presenting significant challenges for bone defect repair. To address these issues, a high‐strength gelatin hydrogel scaffold loaded with roxadustat is developed, specifically designed to remodel the inflammatory microenvironment and enhance osteoporotic bone regeneration. By incorporating minimal methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) into an o‐nitrobenzyl functionalized gelatin (GelNB) matrix, a gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength of 10 MPa is achieved, providing exceptional structural stability and enabling precise scaffold fabrication through digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Validated through cell experiments and animal studies, the hydrogel scaffold supports cell adhesion and migration, offers excellent tissue compatibility, and is fully degradable, meeting the requirements of a therapeutic scaffold. Including roxadustat further enhances the scaffold's functionality by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment via hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α) signaling, significantly improving bone defect repair in osteoporotic models. This drug‐loaded scaffold effectively addresses inflammation‐induced limitations and enhances the regenerative capacity of the affected area, paving the way for improved therapeutic outcomes in osteoporotic bone repair.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Metal‐covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) are novel porous materials that exhibit the advantages of covalent and metal‐organic frameworks. However, it is extremely difficult to resolve their atomic structure and better understand their structure‐properties relation. This work utilizes a synergistic combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods to unravel the atomic mapping of a photoactive ruthenium‐MCOF.








Abstract
Covalent and metal‐organic frameworks (COFs and MOFs) have shown great promise in light‐driven processes mainly due to their ligand‐to‐metal charge‐separation properties, as well as having access to a diverse range of photoactive metalloligands and organic linkers. However, both frameworks present individual drawbacks that can potentially be avoided by combining both systems (metal and covalent) to produce metal‐covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), exhibiting the advantages of both material types. Yet, due to their poor crystallinity, the understanding of the structure‐properties relation of MCOFs remains unclear. Herein, we report photoactive linkers in the form of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (tpy: 2,2′,6,2″‐terpyridine) complex which covalently binds to a luminescent pyrene core to yield a new, photoactive Schiff‐base MCOF. The structure, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of this novel material have been exhaustively characterized by a wide range of microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods. This combined experimental and computational work represents a significant step toward the fundamental understanding of the photoactive units within the framework, their hierarchical arrangement and interactions with substrates, which is essential for the future design of efficient photocatalytic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated chromium(III)‐telluride‐coated liquid metal droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, nonadhesion to surfaces, and cost‐effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magnetointeractive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Magnetic liquid metal droplets, featured by unique fluidity, metallic conductivity, and magnetic reactivity, are of growing significance for next‐generation flexible electronics. Conventional fabrication routes, which typically incorporate magnetic nanoparticles into liquid metals, otherwise encounter the pitfall pertaining to surface adhesivity and corrosivity over device modules. Here, an innovative approach of synergizing liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials is presented, accordingly creating chromium(III)‐telluride‐coated liquid metal (CT–LM) droplets via a simple self‐assembly process. The CT–LM droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, demonstrate nonadherence to various surfaces, and enable cost‐effective recycling of components. The functionality of CT–LM droplets is validated through their use in magnetointeractive memory devices to enable sensing/storing 64 magnetic paths and in wearable sensors as the flexible vibrator for dynamic gesture recognition with machine learning assistance. This work opens new avenues for the functional droplet design and broadens the horizons of flexible electronics.

<title>Hydrogen‐Bonded Organic Framework Nanoscintillators for X‐Ray‐Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators (BPT‐HOF@PEG) is designed and engineered to enhance X‐PDT for unresectable HCC treatment. Precise tumor localization capability of SRT and effective X‐ray energy absorbing and transferring capability of BPT‐HOF@PEG endowing BPT‐HOF@PEG‐mediated X‐PDT approach with significant HCC therapeutic potential. Therefore, phosphorescent HOF‐based X‐PDT is an ideal alternative therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.








Abstract
X‐ray induced photodynamic therapy (X‐PDT) leverages penetrating X‐ray to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for treating deep‐seated tumors. However, conventional X‐PDT typically relies on heavy metal inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to produce 1O2, which presents challenges related to toxicity and energy conversion efficiency. In this study, highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent nanoscintillators based on hydrogen‐bonded organic frameworks (HOF) are designed and engineered, termed BPT‐HOF@PEG, to enhance X‐PDT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. BPT‐HOF@PEG functions simultaneously as both scintillator and photosensitizer, effectively absorbing and transferring X‐ray energy to generate abundant 1O2. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that internalized BPT‐HOF@PEG efficiently produces significant quantities of 1O2 upon X‐ray irradiation. Additionally, X‐ray exposure directly inflicts DNA damage, and the synergistic effects of these mechanisms result in pronounced cell death and substantial tumor growth inhibition, with a significant inhibition rate of up to 90.4% in vivo assessments. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that X‐PDT induces apoptosis in Hepa1‐6 cells while inhibiting cell proliferation, culminating in tumor cell death. Therefore, this work highlights the considerable potential of efficient phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators‐based X‐PDT as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC, providing a highly effective alternative with negligible toxicity for patients with unresectable tumors.

<title>Two Material Properties from One Wavelength‐Orthogonal Photoresin Enabled by a Monochromatic Laser Integrated Stereolithographic Apparatus (Mono LISA)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A single object with dual properties – degradable and non‐degradable – is fabricated in a single print simply by switching the printing colors. The advanced multi‐material printing is enabled by the combination of a fully wavelength‐orthogonal photoresin and a monochromatic tunable laser printer, paving the way for precise multi‐material differentiation within a single print.









Abstract
Multi‐material printing has experienced critical advances in recent years, yet material property differentiation capabilities remain limited both with regard to the accessible properties – typically hard versus soft – and the achievable magnitude of differentiation. To enhance multi‐material printing capabilities, precise photochemical control during 3D printing is essential. Wavelength‐differentiation is a particularly intriguing concept yet challenging to implement. Notably, dual‐wavelength printing to fabricate hard and soft sections within one object has emerged, where one curing process is insensitive to visible light, while UV irradiation inevitably activates the entire resin, limiting true spatio‐temporal control of the material properties. Until now, pathway‐independent wavelength‐orthogonal printing has not been realized, where each wavelength exclusively triggers only one of two possible reactions, independent of the order in which the wavelengths are applied. Herein, a multi‐wavelength printing technique is introduced employing a tunable laser to monochromatically deliver light to the printing platform loaded with a fully wavelength‐orthogonal resin. Guided by photochemical action plots, two distinct wavelengths – each highly selective toward a specific photocycloaddtion reaction – are utilized to generate distinct networks within the photoresin. Ultimately, together with the printing technique, this orthogonally addressable photoresin allows fabricating multi‐material objects with degradable and non‐degradable properties, in a single fabrication step.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dual‐gradient silk‐based hydrogel is developed via an electric‐field‐driven method to enhance osteochondral regeneration. By integrating biomechanical and biochemical gradients, the hydrogel mimics native tissue architecture, directing site‐specific cell differentiation. Encapsulated TGF‐β1 nanocapsules ensure sustained release, promoting cartilage formation and subchondral bone remodeling, demonstrating its potential for regenerative medicine and targeted therapies.








Abstract
Contemporary clinical interventions for cartilage injuries focus on symptom management through pharmaceuticals and surgical procedures. Recent research has aimed at developing innovative scaffolds with biochemical elements, yet challenges like inadequate targeted delivery and reduced load‐bearing capacity hinder their adoption. Inspired by the spatial gradients of biophysical and biochemical cues in native osteochondral tissues, a silk‐based hydrogel that facilitates spontaneous dual‐gradient formation, including mechanical gradients and growth factor gradients, for tissue regeneration, is presented. Driven by an electrical field, the hydrogel transitions from stiff to soft along the anode‐to‐cathode direction, mimicking the anisotropic structure of natural tissues. Simultaneously, incorporated growth factors encapsulated by charged monomers migrate to the cathode region, creating another parallel gradient that enables their sustained release. This design maintains bioactivity and enhances programmable growth factor concentration in the defect environment. In a rabbit model with full‐thickness osteochondral defects, the dual‐gradient hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for promoting osteochondral regeneration, offering a promising tool for clinical translation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Highly cycle‐stable photo‐assisted all‐solid‐state sodium‐metal batteries are successfully designed and constructed based on computational screening of catalytic active fillers and mechanical reinforcement from natural lignocellulose fillers, combined with the coupling mechanism of light‐driven and photoelectrochemical storage. These innovations enable the flexible photo‐assisted pouch battery to achieve a high discharge capacity of 117 mAh g−1, while maintaining 89.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The advancement of photo‐assisted rechargeable sodium‐metal batteries with high energy efficiency, lightweight structure, and simplified design is crucial for the growing demand in portable electronics. However, addressing the intrinsic safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and the sluggish reaction kinetics in existing photoelectrochemical storage cathodes (PSCs) remains a significant challenge. In this work, functionalized light‐driven composite solid electrolyte (CSE) fillers are systematically screened, and optimized PSC materials are employed to construct advanced photo‐assisted solid‐state sodium‐metal battery (PSSMB). To further enhance the mechanical properties and poly(ethylene oxide) compatibility of the CSE, natural lignocellulose is incorporated, enabling the fabrication of flexible PSSMBs. In situ tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that the light‐driven electric field facilitated sodium salt dissociation, reduced interfacial resistance, and improved ionic conductivity (0.1 mS cm−1). Meanwhile, energy‐level matching of the PSC maximized the utilization of photogenerated carriers, accelerating reaction kinetics and enhancing interface compatibility between the electrolyte and cathode. The resulting flexible pouch‐type PSSMB demonstrates a remarkable discharge capacity of 117 mAh g−1 and outstanding long‐term cycling stability, retaining 89.1% of its capacity and achieving an energy storage efficiency of 96.8% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study highlights a versatile strategy for advancing safe, high‐performance solid‐state batteries.

The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics. The implementation of valley‐based devices remains challenging in practice. Utilizing the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the long‐desired valley devices, such as filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported.

Abstract
The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics and offered the prospect for new devices based on valleys. However, the implementation of valley‐based devices remains challenging in practice. Here, by taking advantage of the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the realizations of valley devices, or filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. All the devices are configured as the structures of input and output ports bridged by channels. The phononic crystals serving as ports allow the propagation of both valley polarizations, whereas the phononic crystals serving as channels, as they are narrow, only allow the propagation of single polarizations. For valley filters that achieve valley‐polarized currents, the bridge channel is simply a straight single phononic crystal, but for valley valves that can turn off the valley‐polarized currents, the channel consists of two parts, allowing the propagation of opposite valley polarizations. The valley diverters have one input port, and two output ports, and thus a branched channel, and the three parts in the channel allow the propagation of the same valley polarizations, so that the energy flow can be partitioned. The results may serve as a basis for developing advanced acoustic valley devices.

<title>Doping Mo Triggers Charge Distribution Optimization and P Vacancy of Ni2P@Ni12P5 Heterojunction for Industrial Electrocatalytic Production of Adipic Acid and H2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A robust Mo‐dopedNi2P@Ni12P5 heterojunction with rich P vacancies on Ni foam is proposed for accomplishing simultaneous electrooxidation of CHA to AA and HER at large current density with 85.7% yield of AA and 100% Faradaic efficiency of H2 production at 232 mA cm−2. Synergistic charge optimization and P vacancy by Mo Doping endows the enhanced bifunctional performances.








Abstract
Synchronous electrosynthesis of value‐added adipic acid (AA) and H2 is extremely crucial for carbon neutrality. However, accomplishing the preparation of AA and H2 at large current density with high selectivity is still challenging. Herein, a robust Mo‐doped Ni2P@Ni12P5 heterojunction with more P vacancies on Ni foam is proposed for accomplishing simultaneous electrooxidation of cyclohexanol (CHAOR) to AA and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at large current density. Combined X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X‐ray absorption fine structure, and electron spin resonance confirm that Mo incorporation induces the charge redistribution of Ni2P@Ni12P5, where Mo adjusts electrons from Ni to P, and triggers more P vacancies. Further experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the d‐band center is upshifted, optimizing adsorption energies of water and hydrogen on electron‐rich P site for boosting HER activity. Besides, more Ni3+ generated from electron‐deficient Ni induced by Mo, alongside more OH* triggered from more P vacancies concurrently promote CHA dehydrogenation and C─C bond cleavage, decreasing energy barrier of CHAOR. Consequently, a two‐electrode flow electrolyzer achieves industrial current density (>230 mA cm−2) with 85.7% AA yield, 100% Faradaic efficiency of H2 production. This study showcases an industrial bifunctional electrocatalyst for AA and H2 production with high productivity.

<title>Nanosized Multistate Configurations of Relaxor‐Like Antiferroelectric Revealed by Atomic‐Scale In Situ Electron Microscopy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Atomic‐scale in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy of the (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti)O3 materials reveals the origin of characteristic hysteresis behavior of relaxor‐like antiferroelectric. The nanosized multistate configurations which encompass antiferroelectric, quasi‐paraelectric, and ferroelectric nanoregions are responsible for the slim double hysteresis loops of relaxor‐like antiferroelectric. Such nanosized multistate configurations break the common belief of single‐phase antiferroelectric nanodomains.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric materials have garnered significant attention for their potential applications in high‐power capacitors. Among the four technically important types of ferroelectric states‐classical ferroelectric, relaxor ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and relaxor antiferroelectric‐the first three have well‐defined physical pictures, while the fourth remains contentious. Here, atomic‐scale in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy is demonstrated to provide a clear resolution to this long‐standing issue. The temperature‐dependent configurational evolution during the transition from room‐temperature classical antiferroelectric to high‐temperature relaxor‐like antiferroelectric in (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti)O3 materials is directly observed. The nanosized multistate configurations formed during transformation, which encompass antiferroelectric, quasi‐paraelectric, and ferroelectric nanoregions, are responsible for the slim double hysteresis loops characteristic of relaxor‐like antiferroelectric. These findings offer new guidelines for validating the physical models essential for the development of high‐performance relaxor‐like antiferroelectrics.

<title>A Bioinspired Micro‐Grooved Structure for Low Snow Adhesion and Effective Snow‐Shedding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A bioinspired micro‐groove structure is developed to address the challenges of snow and ice accumulation. By minimizing capillary effects, and reducing mechanical interlocking, this multifunctional design highlights two key metrics for snow prevention surfaces: adhesion reduction and shedding efficiency, paving the way for applications in energy systems and architecture.








Abstract
Many outdoor devices require effective snow prevention solutions, yet existing passive anti‐icing technologies are inadequate for snow repellency due to the variability of snow properties. This study addresses this gap by proposing a bioinspired micro‐grooved anti‐snow structure that minimizes van der Waals forces through reduced contact area and mitigates capillary effects via a V‐shaped design, facilitating the separation of liquid water at the interface. Snow‐shedding performance is shown to be highly sensitive to surface roughness, with the periodic smoothness of micro‐grooves significantly reducing mechanical interlocking with snow. In contrast, hierarchical superhydrophobic structures strongly interlock with ice grains, preventing spontaneous snow‐shedding even at extremely low adhesion forces. By embedding superhydrophobic nanoparticles into the micro‐groove structure, this study presents a multifunctional design that integrates anti‐icing, anti‐snow, and water‐repellent properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the structure effectively balances adhesion reduction and snow‐shedding performance, showing promising potential for photovoltaic solar power systems and large‐scale architectural applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To address off‐target organ enrichment and low endosomal escape during mRNA delivery, the study learns from the technology of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and integrate cholesterol moieties and zwitterionic species into branched poly(β‐amino ester)s (hPAEs) to obtain “four‐in‐one” LNP‐like hPAEs (O‐LhPAEs), which have spleen‐targeted delivery and have potential for the treatment of silicosis by nebulization.








Abstract
mRNA therapeutics hold tremendous promise for disease prevention and treatment. Development of high‐performance mRNA delivery systems with enhanced transfection efficiency and a safety profile will further fulfill their therapeutic potential and expedite their translation. The synthesis of “four‐in‐one” highly branched poly(β‐amino ester)s (O‐LhPAEs) is reported by integrating the essential components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for spleen‐selective mRNA enrichment and nebulization treatment of silicosis. 60 O‐LhPAEs with distinct branched structure and chemical composition, including tertiary/quaternary amines, cholesterol moieties, zwitterionic species, and hydrophobic alkyl tails, are synthesized using sequential Michael addition, ring‐opening, and nucleophilic substitution reactions. The unique topological structure and chemical composition collectively enhanced O‐LhPAEs/mRNA polyplex serum resistance, cellular uptake, and endosomal escape. The optimal O‐LhPAE, 20%b‐3C‐2P12, exhibits up to 93.1% mRNA transfection across 11 different cell types, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, cancer cells, stem cells, neurological cells, and astrocytes. Biodistribution study reveals that 20%b‐3C‐2P12/mRNA polyplexes are mainly enriched in the spleen following systemic administration. Through nebulization, 20%b‐3C‐2P12 mediated high Tbx2 mRNA expression in the lungs of silicosis mice, effectively restoring lung functions. This study not only establishes a strategy for development of LNP‐like O‐LhPAEs but also provides promising candidates for highly safe, efficient, and spleen‐selective mRNA delivery and nebulization treatment of silicosis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Long‐lived circularly polarized organic long persistent luminescence (CP‐OLPL) is achieved by constructing a chiral exciplex system, with green CP‐OLPL emission lasting over 1.5 hours and exhibiting an asymmetry factor of 4.5 × 10−3. Additionally, by incorporating a fluorophore emitter and utilizing synergistic singlet‐singlet and chirality energy transfer, an orange‐red CP‐OLPL with a duration exceeding 1 hour is realized, showcasing its potential for applications in afterglow display and lighting, and multi‐level information encryption.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic long persistent luminescence (CP‐OLPL) has garnered significant attention due to its distinctive properties. However, achieving CP‐OLPL materials with ultralong durations remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed to obtain long‐lived CP‐OLPL by constructing a self‐designed chiral donor for developing a host–guest chiral exciplex system. The gradual recombination of long‐lived charge‐separated states enables a green CP‐OLPL emission to persist for over 1.5 hours with an asymmetry factor (|glum|) of 4.5 × 10−3. More intriguingly, doping with rubrene fluorophore yields an orange‐red CP‐OLPL system, exhibiting a duration over 1 hour and |glum| of 2.3 × 10−3 through synergistic singlet‐singlet and chirality energy transfer. These properties render the development of chiral afterglow display, multi‐level information encryption, and afterglow lighting. This work not only represents a significant advancement in the design of chiral donors for ultralong CP‐OLPL exciplex system with durations but also provides valuable insights into exciton dynamics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ubiquitous defects predominately account for photo‐instability and open‐circuit voltage losses in wide‐bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). This review comprehensively presents the underlying impact mechanisms, summarizes the advanced optimization strategies across various functional layers and their interfaces to develop efficient and stable WBG PSCs, and evaluates their performance in semitransparent solar cells, tandem solar cells, and indoor photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Wide‐bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top‐cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect‐mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self‐accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi‐Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross‐sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.

This study demonstrates a p‐type cuprous sulfide lattice connectedly capping over Cs3Cu2I5 to form lattice‐matched core/shell nanocrystals by controlling the reactivity of sulfur precursor in the synthesis. The resulting pure white PeLEDs achieved by combining with yellow emission CsCu2I3 exhibit a recorded EQE of 3.45% and a high CRI of 91.








Abstract
The copper‐based (Cu‐based) halide perovskite possesses eco‐friendly features, bright self‐trapped‐exciton (broadband) emission, and a high color‐rendering index (CRI) for achieving white emission. However, the limited hole injection (HI) of Cu‐based perovskites has been bottle‐necking the efficiency of white electroluminescence and thus their application in white perovskite light‐emitting diodes (W‐PeLEDs). In this study, we demonstrate a p‐type cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) lattice‐connectedly capping over Cs3Cu2I5 to form lattice‐matched core/shell nanocrystals (NCs) by controlling the reactivity of sulfur (S) precursor in the synthesis. Interestingly, the resultant Cs3Cu2I5/Cu2S NCs significantly enhance the hole mobility compared to Cs3Cu2I5 NCs. Besides, the photoluminescence quantum yield of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs increases from 26.8% to 70.6% after the Cu2S lattice‐connected capping. Consequently, by establishing the structure of CsCu2I3/Cs3Cu2I5/Cu2S in W‐PeLEDs, an external quantum efficiency of 3.45% and a CRI of 91 is realized, representing the highest reported electroluminescent performance in lead‐free Cu‐based W‐PeLEDs. These findings contribute to establishing guidelines and effective strategies for designing broadband electroluminescent materials and device structures of PeLEDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Real‐space nanoimaging of unidirectional hybridized exciton‐polariton (EPs). The resolution to observe near‐field SOC can be very high (down to 10 nm) and the contrast can be clearly distinguished at the real‐space. The work provides an alternative but more direct approach to uncover the underlying physics of optical SOC and EP properties.








Abstract
Unidirectional excitation of highly confined guided modes is essential for nanoscale energy transport, photonic integrated devices, and quantum information processing. Among various feasible approaches, the mechanism based on optical spin–orbit coupling is investigated for unidirectional routing of surface plasmons and valley exciton‐polaritons, without needing the use of complicated magneto‐optical effects and parity symmetry breaking. So far, the direct near‐field nanoimaging of such exotic polaritonic modes based on optical spin–orbit coupling has remained elusive. Here, the real‐space nanoimaging of unidirectional polaritons in van der Waals semiconductors are reported. Specifically, photonic spins are coupled into the tip of a scattering‐type scanning near‐field optical microscopy for circular dipolar excitations of spin–orbit interactions, thus enabling the unidirectional waveguide exciton‐polariton propagation with remarkable unidirectionality (ratio of spectrum amplitudes under opposite circularly polarized illumination) R = 0.291 for TM mode. Via switching to the opposite helicities, the reversed opposite directions are observed. The work offers a promising avenue for detecting and processing spin information for future communication technology at the nanoscale.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The large‐pore MSNs with a high specific surface area serve as a platform for covalent PMB grafting and bactericidal CQD loading. CQD@lMSN‐PMB exhibits efficient antibacterial activity alongside synchronous endotoxin neutralization. In Gram‐negative bacterial keratitis, CQD@lMSN‐PMB effectively and comprehensively suppresses the immune‐inflammatory response, preserving corneal integrity and transparency.








Abstract
In the treatment of infectious keratitis, therapeutic strategies often prioritize enhancing bactericidal efficacy. However, endotoxins released from Gram‐negative bacteria cause inflammatory reaction, leading to corneal structural damage and scar formation. Given that polymyxin B (PMB) can bind and neutralize lipopolysaccharide (LPS), this study employs large‐pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (lMSNs) grafted with PMB as carriers for cationic antibacterial carbon quantum dots (CQDs) to prepare CQD@lMSN‐PMB, which enables synchronous sterilization and endotoxin neutralization. In the acidic infectious microenvironment, the accelerated release of CQDs eliminates 99.88% bacteria within 2 h, effectively substituting immune mediated sterilization. Notably, CQD@lMSN‐PMB exhibits exceptional LPS neutralization performance (2.22 µg LPS/mg CQD@lMSN‐PMB) due to its high specific surface area. In an infectious keratitis model, inflammation subsides significantly within the first day of CQD@lMSN‐PMB intervention and is completely resolved by day 3. By day 2, interleukin‐1β, interleukin‐6 and tumor necrosis factor‐α in CQD@lMSN‐PMB group decrease by 86.99%, 91.15%, and 77.56%, respectively, compared to the CQDs‐only sterilization group. Ultimately, corneal integrity and transparency are preserved, with suppressed expressions of fibrosis‐related factors including matrix metalloproteinase 9, transforming growth factor‐β and α‐smooth muscle actin. Therefore, this synchronous sterilization and endotoxin neutralization strategy outperforms monotherapy strategies focused solely on sterilization or endotoxin neutralization.

<title>High‐Performance Hybrid Organic‐Inorganic Lanthanide Halide Glass Scintillators Enabled by Dehydration for Efficient X‐Ray Imaging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents an effective strategy for developing high‐performance hybrid organic‐inorganic lanthanide halide glass scintillators for X‐ray imaging through the dehydration of crystalline precursors. This process not only effectively suppresses melt crystallization but also enhances radioluminescence by improving X‐ray‐to‐visible photon conversion efficiency. Thus, it enables the fabrication of large, transparent scintillators suitable for high‐resolution X‐ray imaging.








Abstract
Although glass scintillators hold great promise for high‐resolution X‐ray imaging, the practical application is often limited by thermodynamic instability, leading to uncontrolled glass‐to‐crystal transformations that degrade imaging resolution. Herein, a novel strategy is presented to synthesize (methyl(triphenyl)phosphonium)3EuCl6 ((MTP)3EuCl6) glass scintillators through the dehydration of their crystalline precursors. The findings reveal that the dehydration process significantly enhances the stability of the glass scintillators by confining the constituent ions within a rigid, highly viscous matrix. This confinement effectively restricts ion mobility and prevents the reorganization required for crystal nucleation. Moreover, the dehydration reduces the trapping of in situ generated charge carriers and increases the photoluminescence quantum yield, leading to enhanced radioluminescence performance. The resulting (MTP)3EuCl6 glass scintillators demonstrate an X‐ray detection limit as low as 95.8 nGyair s⁻¹ and achieve a spatial imaging resolution of 14.3 lp mm−1 at a dose rate of 5 mGyair s⁻¹. This work provides valuable insights into designing glass scintillators that integrate long‐term thermodynamic stability with optimized scintillation performance, offering significant potential for advanced X‐ray imaging applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A strategy is implemented to embed dermal fibroblasts in collagen in contact with anisotropic hydrogel fibers. Fibroblasts generate traction forces and remodel the collagen matrix, following the alignment cues of the hydrogel template. The orientational order is transferred to the fibroblasts, inducing collective alignment. Cell alignment generates internally driven, oriented forces that ultimately lead to programmed 2D and 3D shape changes of the cell‐laden collagen matrices, such as transforming from square to diamond, or from flat to dome. This approach provides insights into the role of topological defects in morphogenesis and advances new techniques for developing shape‐morphing materials with programmable forces.








Abstract
During morphogenesis, cells collectively execute directional forces that drive the programmed folding and growth of the layers, forming tissues and organs. The ability to recapitulate aspects of these processes in  vitro will constitute a significant leap forward in the field of tissue engineering. Free‐standing, self‐organizing, cell‐laden matrices are fabricated using a sequential deposition approach that uses liquid crystal‐templated hydrogel fibers to direct cell arrangements. The orientation of hydrogel fibers is controlled using flow or boundary cues, while their microstructures are controlled by depletion interaction and probed by scattering and microscopy. These fibers effectively direct cells embedded in a collagen matrix, creating multilayer structures through contact guidance and by leveraging steric interactions amongst the cells. In uniformly aligned cell matrices, oriented cells exert traction forces that can induce preferential contraction of the matrix. Simultaneously, the matrix densifies and develops anisotropy through cell remodeling. Such an approach can be extended to create cell arrangements with arbitrary in‐plane patterns, allowing for coordinated cell forces and pre‐programmed, macroscopic shape changes. This work reveals a fundamentally new path for controlled force generation, emphasizing the role of a carefully designed initial orientational field for manipulating shape transformations of reconstituted matrices.

An organic BTHG agent called OTBP with prominent crystallinity is developed. The resonant absorption at 433 nm and prominent crystallinity of OTBP enhance its BTHG efficiency when excited by a 1300 nm femtosecond laser. Tuning the size of OTBP nanocrystals based on Mie scattering theory successfully enables them to achieve high‐contrast muti‐organ angiography with ultra‐low pulse energy (100 pJ) and thereby negligible photodamage risk.








Abstract
Organic materials featuring third harmonic generation (THG) hold great promise for deep‐tissue bioimaging due to their good biocompatibility and second near‐infrared excitation. However, minimizing photodamage from the incident light necessitates significant improvements in the third‐order nonlinear susceptibility. Herein, an organic luminogen called OTBP is developed as a backward THG (BTHG) contrast agent for second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) angiography. OTBP's intense absorption at 433 nm resonantly enhances its BTHG efficiency when excited by a 1300 nm femtosecond laser. In the aggregate state, the robust intermolecular interactions among OTBP molecules realize excellent crystallinity and the facile preparation of nanocrystals (NCs) with a high refractive index of 1.78. By leveraging Mie scattering theory, the best size of OTBP NCs for BTHG collection is attained. These integrated properties result in a high BTHG efficiency of OTBP NCs. Encapsulating the NCs with F‐127 enables ultralow‐power but high‐contrast 3D vasculature imaging with negligible photodamage and background interference. Further elevating the laser power to 60 mW enables the visualization of microvessels at 500 µm with a high SNR of 143. This study offers insights into material design strategies toward efficient organic BTHG contrast agents and paves the way for the materials‐oriented non‐linear optics.

<title>Charge Polarization Tunable Interfaces for Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel interfacial chemical tuning strategy is proposed involving proton transfer between the amine of pyridoxamine (PM) and the phosphonic acid of Me‐4PACz. This process enhances charge delocalization via electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged molecules, yielding a Me‐4PACz‐PM charge polarization interface that improves NiOx p‐type conductivity, facilitates band alignment, and supports high‐quality perovskite films, showcasing its commercial potential.








Abstract
Interfacial localized charges and interfacial losses from incompatible underlayers are critical factors limiting the efficiency improvement and market‐integration of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a novel interfacial chemical tuning strategy is proposed involving proton transfer between the amine head of pyridoxamine (PM) and the phosphonic acid anchoring group of [4‐(3,6‐dimethyl‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me‐4PACz), with simultaneous enhancement of charge delocalization through electrostatic attraction between opposite charged molecules. The Me‐4PACz‐PM charge polarization interface modulates the nickel oxide (NiOx) charge states and the coordination environment at buried interfaces, consequently enhancing p‐type conductivity and obtaining a more compatible band arrangement. The high‐coverage and wettability of the NiOx/Me‐4PACz‐PM underlayer also facilitate the deposition of high‐quality perovskite films, releasing lattice strain and mitigating trap‐assisted non‐radiative recombination. Attributing to the implementation of charge polarization tunable interfaces, small‐area devices and modules with an aperture area of 69 cm2 achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.34% (certified 25.48%) and 21.94% (certified 20.50%), respectively, and unencapsulated devices maintained their initial PCEs ≈90% after aging for 2000 h (ISOS‐L‐1) and 1500 h (ISOS‐D‐1). The broad applicability of charge polarization tunable interfaces and the successful scaling of large‐area modules provide a reference for expanding PSCs applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In this work, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all‐iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.








Abstract
Aqueous all‐iron redox flow batteries are an attractive and economic technology for grid‐scale energy storage owing to their use of abundant and environmentally benign iron as the redox active material and water as solvent. However, the battery operation is challenged by the plating/stripping reactions of iron and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode, which hinder performance and durability. Here, the reaction selectivity of the negative electrode is tailored by introducing conductive polymer coatings onto porous carbonaceous electrodes. Two conductive polymers, poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(pyrrole) (PPy) are conformally coated with the dopant poly(4‐styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and the resulting electrochemistry is studied on model electroanalytical platforms and redox flow batteries. Both polymers decrease the hydrogen evolution current on rotating disc electrodes, with PPy/PSS strongly inhibiting the reaction at high overpotentials. In full all‐iron redox flow cells, PPy/PSS coating extends cyclability and significantly reduces hydrogen evolution, while PEDOT/PSS coating improves the round‐trip efficiency, possibly acting as a redox shuttle for the iron stripping reaction. These findings motivate broader investigation and implementation of conductive polymers to engineer reaction selectivity for flow batteries and other electrochemical technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This research proposes a multistage competitive coordination chromogenic mechanism between metal‐polyphenols and amines. Based on this, a metal‐polyphenol network colorimetric sensor array (MPN‐CSA) for real‐time monitoring of meat freshness has been developed, achieving a detection rate of 99.83% through convolutional neural network technology. This sensitive, accurate, stable, eco‐friendly, and economical solution can enhance food safety and reduce food waste.








Abstract
A low‐cost, high‐precision, and secure real‐time system for monitoring food freshness can significantly improve spoilage issues, yet traditional colorimetric sensor arrays often suffer from chemical dyes’ high toxicity and limited color changes. Here, a metal‐polyphenol network colorimetric sensor array (MPN‐CSA) is built for detecting total volatile base nitrogen (TVB‐N) markers of meat freshness. The multi‐level competitive coordination process between the metal‐polyphenol system and amine substances endows the system with color changes far beyond those of traditional dyes (reaching a detection limit of 300 ppb). By integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) technology, an online platform is developed for monitoring meat freshness, achieving an overall detection accuracy rate of 99.83%. This environmentally friendly, economically viable MPN‐CSA that monitors the freshness of meat in complex storage environments can be incorporated into food packaging boxes, enabling consumers and suppliers to assess the freshness of meat in real‐time, thus helping to reduce food waste and prevent foodborne illnesses.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, a 3D superionic transport skeleton Na3P is in situ constructed within the sodium anode, which successfully enhances the ion diffusion coefficient of the anode from 2.54 × 10‒8 to 1.33 × 10‒7 cm2 s‒1. Thanks to the ultrafast ion transport and excellent interfacial stability, the solid‐state sodium‐metal battery can be stably cycled for more than 15 000‐cycle at 3C.








Abstract
Solid‐state sodium‐metal batteries (SSSMBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next‐generation energy storage systems due to their natural abundance, cost‐effectiveness, and high safety. However, the intrinsically low ionic conductivity of sodium anode (SA) and poor wettability to solid‐state electrolyte (SSE) severely hinder the development of SSSMBs. In this study, a 3D superionic transport skeleton Na3P is in situ constructed within the sodium anode by simply melting inexpensive and low‐density red phosphorus with sodium, which successfully enhances the ion diffusion rate from 2.54 × 10‒8 to 1.33 × 10‒7 cm2 s‒1. Moreover, Na3P in the composite sodium anode (CSA) effectively induces the uniform deposition of Na on the surface of SSE, significantly reducing the interface impedance of symmetric cells from the initial value of 749.15 to 14.97 Ω cm2. Enabled by the integrated 3D superionic transport skeleton, the symmetric cell achieves exceptional cycle stability of over 7000 h at 0.1 mA cm‒2 and 4000 h at 0.3 mA cm‒2. Furthermore, SSSMBs incorporating CSA demonstrate an ultralong lifespan of over 15 000 cycles at 3C while maintaining a high‐loading operation capability, significantly outperforming previously reported studies. This study highlights the crucial role of cost‐effective CSA design with enhanced ion transport in advancing high‐performance SSSMBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The interface in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells is regulated via the flexible molecule of dodecaethylene glycol (DEG) with abundant polar oxygen atoms. The regulation modulated the wetting sequence of the scaffold, promoted perovskite crystallization in the scaffold, and relaxed interface stress. The device with interface regulation successfully achieved an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.27% and demonstrated good stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have achieved remarkable progress in photovoltaic performance, driven by advancements in interface engineering. The buried interface between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer is particularly critical, as it governs both perovskite crystallization and the formation of residual strain. In this study, the buried interface in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p‐MPSCs) based on a triple‐mesoporous scaffold of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon is reconstructed by employing dodecaethylene glycol (DEG), a long chain molecule rich in polar oxygen atoms, to enhance device performance. Treating the scaffold with DEG optimizes the wettability sequence across the three layers by improving the TiO2 surface's wettability, facilitating the preferential crystallization of perovskite in the underlying TiO2 layer. Moreover, the DEG layer effectively buffers residual strain and suppresses detrimental defects at the interface. As a result, p‐MPSCs with the optimized interface achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.27% and retain over 92% of their initial PCE after 500 h of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking.

This study reports an effective strategy, OSPLIT (optothermal‐stimulated persistent luminescence imaging and therapy), which enables high‐contrast imaging and the thermal ablation of lymph node metastases. The rational design of these nanomaterials is detailed and mechanistic insights are provided, demonstrating the advantages of optothermal‐stimulated NIR‐II persistent luminescence in lanthanide‐doped nanoparticles over conventional NIR‐II fluorescence imaging.








Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanomaterials have significantly advanced in vivo bioimaging and biosensing by emitting photons after excitation ceases, effectively minimizing tissue autofluorescence. However, their application in biomedical fields such as tumor theranostics is limited by low brightness and rapid signal decay. To address these issues, OSPLIT (optothermal‐stimulated persistent luminescence imaging therapy), a dual‐function strategy for imaging and treatment is introduced. The OSPLIT approach enhances the release of charge carriers from deep traps in lanthanide‐doped nanoparticles, resulting in a 73 fold increase in persistent luminescence within the second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) window. In living mice, it enables high‐contrast imaging of lymph node metastases, with a signal‐to‐background ratio 11.8 times greater than conventional NIR‐II fluorescence. Optothermal‐boosted nanoparticles are effective in ablating lymph node metastasis and preventing tumor spread. These findings highlight the potential of optothermal stimulation to enhance persistent luminescence for both imaging and therapeutic applications.

A novel method for detecting cancer cells and monitoring apoptosis employs electron‐sink‐enhanced surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Gold (Au) shells coated with electroactive liposome membranes amplify the SERS signal through active electron transfer. This technique enables real‐time and highly sensitive detection of cancer cells by measuring apoptosis‐associated electron flow, offering a powerful approach for distinguishing cancerous from normal cells.








Abstract
A novel method is presented for detecting cancer cells and assessing apoptosis using electron‐sink‐enhanced surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) via active electron transfer. By coating gold (Au) shells with electroactive liposome membranes (ELMs) derived from Shewanella oneidensis MR‐1, the SERS signal is enhanced through chemical mechanism (CM) enhancement driven by electron transfer. The ELMs first donate electrons to the Au shells, which, upon laser excitation, amplify the local electromagnetic field, resulting in stronger Raman signals from the attached probing molecules. Additionally, the electron flow from cancer cells into the Au shells correlates with apoptosis, producing a strong SERS signal, while normal cells exhibit weaker signals. This method enables real‐time monitoring of cancer cell apoptosis, distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells based on the enhanced Raman signal linked to electron flow. This approach marks a breakthrough in CM‐based SERS applications, offering a sensitive method for cancer detection through the measurement of electron flow.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Isomeric graphdiyne frameworks with ThSi2 topology are synthesized from 2,2′‐binaphthalene and 6,6′‐biazulene‐based isomeric monomers. The biazulene‐based graphdiyne framework shows narrow bandgap of down to 1.15 eV and can act as new platform for loading single metal atoms for high‐performance electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Graphdiynes (GDYs), synthesized via direct coupling of arylacetylenes, have attracted great attention due to their unique electronic properties and structural diversity, typically forming 2D layered frameworks. However, crystalline GDY‐like frameworks with 3D topology remain challenging to synthesize. Here, the study reports two highly crystalline, isomeric GDY‐like frameworks with ThSi2 topology, constructed from 2,2′‐binaphthalene and 6,6′‐biazulene‐based monomers. The azulene‐based framework, due to its large dipole moment, exhibits a narrow bandgap of 1.15 eV, significantly lower than its naphthalene counterpart (2.33 eV). As ruthenium (Ru) single‐atom supports, these frameworks enable strong Ru‐diyne interactions, achieving an ammonia yield rate of 188.7 ± 1.6 µg h−1 mgcat−1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 37.4 ± 0.6%. Such bicontinuous channels and tunable electronic structures offer electrocatalysis field new opportunities. Moreover, the azulene‐based framework, featuring a higher highest occupied molecular orbital  and lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital  energy level, ensures superior electron mobility. These 3D crystalline frameworks introduce a new covalent organic framework (COF) family with diyne linkages and pure carbon skeletons, broadening the scope of COF materials. Their well‐defined structures provide an ideal platform for tuning optoelectronic properties, enabling fundamental studies on structure‐property relationships and opening new opportunities for catalytic and electronic applications.

Diabetic wound repair remains hindered by persistent inflammation, infection risks, and microenvironment dysregulation. Electromagnetic biomaterials offer transformative solutions for intelligent wound monitoring and pathological microenvironment modulation.

Abstract
The diabetic tissue repair process is frequently hindered by persistent inflammation, infection risks, and a compromised tissue microenvironment, which lead to delayed wound healing and significantly impact the quality of life for diabetic patients. Electromagnetic biomaterials offer a promising solution by enabling the intelligent detection of diabetic wounds through electric and magnetic effects, while simultaneously improving the pathological microenvironment by reducing oxidative stress, modulating immune responses, and exhibiting antibacterial action. Additionally, these materials inherently promote tissue regeneration by regulating cellular behavior and facilitating vascular and neural repair. Compared to traditional biomaterials, electromagnetic biomaterials provide advantages such as noninvasiveness, deep tissue penetration, intelligent responsiveness, and multi‐stimuli synergy, demonstrating significant potential to overcome the challenges of diabetic tissue repair. This review comprehensively examines the superiority of electromagnetic biomaterials in diabetic tissue repair, elucidates the underlying biological mechanisms, and discusses specific design strategies and applications tailored to the pathological characteristics of diabetic wounds, with a focus on skin wound healing and bone defect repair. By addressing current limitations and pursuing multi‐faceted strategies, electromagnetic biomaterials hold significant potential to improve clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life for diabetic patients.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, AGEs derived is found from glycated ECM significantly promote tumor growth and VM formation through the RAGE‐HMGB1‐SNAI2 axis. However, carbon dots (egCDs) derived from glycated ECM can competitively bind to RAGE, promoting its lysosomal degradation and inhibiting this process. This finding reveals the transformation of pathogenic substances into therapeutic targeting carriers after carbonization, reversing disease‐driving factors.








Abstract
This study investigates the role of advanced glycation end‐products (AGEs) in tumor vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Using high‐sugar diet animal models and glycated extracellular matrix (ECM) ex vivo models, AGEs derived is demonstrated from glycated ECM significantly enhanced tumor growth and VM formation. However, carbon dots (egCDs) derived from glycated ECM effectively inhibit tumor growth and VM formation in this glycated microenvironment. Mechanistic studies show that AGEs from glycated ECM bind to the Receptor of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) receptors on tumor cells, promoting RAGE nuclear translocation and binding with high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which increases the transcription of Snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), thereby driving VM formation. However, egCDs competitively bind to RAGE, promoting its lysosomal degradation and blocking VM formation induced by the RAGE‐HMGB1‐SNAI2 axis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that egCDs can target RAGE and promote its lysosomal degradation to block VM formation induced by glycated ECM. This finding not only reveals the transformation of glycated ECM from a pro‐VM factor to an anti‐VM therapeutic agent after carbonization, but also provides a theoretical basis for the innovative strategy of “reconstructing pathogenic substances into carbon dots to reverse disease‐driving factors into therapeutic targeting carriers”.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A nacre‐mimetic ceramic‐polymer structural material is developed by a dual‐oxide interface design strategy, achieving high mechanical properties, tunable colors and superior EM wave‐transparent performance. These characteristics make it hold great potential as a protective material for radar and communication equipment.








Abstract
Ceramic materials are widely used in various protective equipment owing to their excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability, while their applications are limited by monotonous color and poor toughness. Inspired by the colorful and tough natural shells, nacre‐mimetic alumina (Al2O3)‐based (NMA) composites are fabricated by proposing a dual‐oxide interface design strategy inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The NMA composites achieve color regulation, providing possibilities for their application in camouflage protective armor. The fracture toughness of the optimal NMA composite is more than three times that of commercial Al2O3 ceramic. Simultaneously, the NMA composites have obvious advantages in terms of impact resistance compared with Al2O3 ceramic and polymer polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Additionally, the hierarchical structure of the NMA composites provides favorable structural conditions for transmission of electromagnetic (EM) waves at the frequency band of 18–26.5 GHz. These characteristics make the NMA composites potential protective materials for radar and communication equipment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A modified chemical vapor transport method incorporating a feedback‐regulated strategy provides closed‐loop control of the growth temperature of MnBi2nTe3n+1 family within ± 0.1 °C, which reveals rich magnetic tunability, such as varying antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4 and inducing magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10.








Abstract
MnBi2nTe3n+1 is a representative family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, in which numerous exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect are expected. The high‐quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback‐regulated strategy is developed, which provides the closed‐loop control of growth temperature within ± 0.1 °C. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold‐end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state can be easily replicated. These results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MnBi2nTe3n+1 family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.

Robust 2D Ruddlesden–Popper lead‐tin perovskites demonstrate exceptional resistive switching memory performance after cesium carbonate deposition, achieving a high accuracy of 90.1% in MNIST pattern recognition. Additionally, a novel energy‐efficient content‐addressable memory architecture, based on perovskite memristive devices, is proposed for neuromorphic applications, demonstrating ultralow energy consumption of ≈0.025 fJ bit−1 per cell.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have drawn great attention for neuromorphic electronic devices in recent years, however, the toxicity of lead as well as the variability and energy consumption of operational devices still pose great challenges for further consideration of this material in neuromorphic computing applications. Here, a 2D Ruddlesden‐Popper (RP) metal halides system of formulation BA2Pb0.5Sn0.5I4 (BA = n‐butylammonium) is prepared that exhibits outstanding resistive switching memory performance after cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) deposition. In particular, the device exhibits excellent switching characteristics (endurance of 5 × 105 cycles, ON/OFF ratio ≈105) and achieves 90.1% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. More importantly, a novel energy‐efficient content addressable memory (CAM) architecture building on perovskite memristive devices for neuromorphic applications, called nCAM, is proposed, which has a minimum energy consumption of ≈0.025 fJ bit/cell. A mechanism involving the manipulation of trapping states through Cs2CO3 deposition is proposed to explain the resistive switching behavior of the memristive device.

Post‐synthesis surface engineering and doping control significantly improve the performance of Ag₂Te CQD photodiodes, achieving a low dark current of 450 nA cm−2 at −0.5 V, an LDR exceeding 150 dB, and a rapid response speed of ≈25 ns.

Abstract
Shortwave infrared (SWIR) light, characterized as the “eye‐safe” window, is considered extremely promising in various technological fields and particularly valuable for imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications. Silver telluride (Ag2Te) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), featuring RoHS‐compliance, solution‐processability, and CMOS compatibility, emerge as a potential contender for SWIR optoelectronics. Yet, further improvements in dark current, response speed, and linear dynamic range (LDR) are essential for meeting the rigorous demands of sensing and LiDAR applications. Here, it is shown that post‐synthesis surface engineering and doping control significantly improve the dark current, response speed, and LDR of Ag₂Te CQD photodiodes, achieving a low dark current of 450 nA cm−2 at −0.5 V, an LDR exceeding 150 dB, and a rapid response speed of ≈25 ns. A proof‐of‐concept LiDAR demonstration in the SWIR using a practical nanosecond diode laser achieves decimetre‐level resolution at a distance exceeding 10 m. This work represents a key step in advancing SWIR CQDs toward consumer electronics and automotive markets.

<title>Proton Reservoir in Covalent Organic Framework Compensating Oxygen Reduction Reaction Enhances Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The incorporation of hydroxyl groups (─OH) as a proton reservoir into the covalent organic framework (COF) can compensate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and achieve a 3.3 times higher H2O2 photosynthetic activity than that of COF without ─OH, which elucidates the favorability mechanisms of regulating the internal proton transfer of COF with proton reservoir in the accelerated ORR progress.









Abstract
The water oxidation reaction (WOR) with sluggish kinetics usually fails to adequately furnish protons to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which ultimately constrains the overall efficiency of photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2, particularly in the absence of sacrificial agents. Herein, a class of hydroxyl groups (─OH) functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) is reported as a proton reservoir to compensate ORR for greatly improving the efficiency of H2O2 photosynthesis. It has been demonstrated that the incorporation of ─OH into the TFBP‐DHBD (TFBP: 1,2,4,5‐tetrakis‐(4‐formylphenyl)benzene, DHBD: 3,3′‐dihydroxybenzidine) COF can achieve a 3.3 times higher H2O2 photosynthetic activity than that of TFBP‐BD (BD: benzidine) COF without ─OH groups. Isotope labeling experiments and in situ infrared spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the proton reservoir can donate protons for ORR and subsequently regain the released protons from WOR. Theoretical calculations further confirm that the ─OH functionalized COF provides the protons for the formation of *OOH intermediate and reduces its energy barrier, thereby facilitating the photosynthesis of H2O2. A novel COF loaded with Al2O3 spheres‐based streamlined microreactor is built that can simultaneously achieve production of H2O2 and elimination of bacteria over 1.3 × 104 CFU mL−1, superior to the reported continuous flow photocatalytic reactors.

<title>Boosting Leaching of Spent Ternary Cathode via Strong Van Der Waals Force Beyond Hydrogen Bonding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, a novel design strategy is proposed by strengthening the van der Waals forces in the nanostructure of DESs, which significantly enhances the reducibility of DESs components. Benefiting from this, the leaching kinetics of metals is greatly improved, resulting in an excellent leaching performance that far exceeds previous reports.








Abstract
Promoting the green and efficient recycling of critical metals in spent ternary batteries represents a crucial step in driving the reduce of resource dependence in the electric vehicle industry. However, the leaching progress of metals from spent cathodes generally requires high reaction temperatures and large usage of solvents. Herein, a strategy is proposed to strengthen the van der Waals forces between solvent components by constructing affinity interactions between functional groups (e.g., ‐OH and ‐COOH), which can significantly enhance the leaching kinetics of metals at a high solid‐liquid ratio and low temperature (30 °C). The results demonstrate that the strong van der Waals force between ascorbic acid with ‐OH group and betaine ions with ‐COOH group can strengthen the nucleophilicity of the carbon atoms and reduce the specific C─C bond energy, thus enhancing the redox capability of the DESs. Encouragingly, the designed solvent shows an impressive leaching performance at a super high S/L ratio (1: 3) without external heating for the actual black mass under a scaled‐up experiment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites are exploited as a new material library of electrode additives for lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), which simultaneously boost lithium‐ion conduction within electrodes and deliver step‐change electrochemical performances. Such a cost‐effectiveness MOF additive approach illuminates a new avenue toward advancing industry‐relevant LIBs.








Abstract
Performances of lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) are dictated by processes of electron‐ion separation, transfers, and combination. While carbon additives are routinely used to ensure electronic conductivity, additives capable of simultaneously boosting ion conduction and delivering step‐change performance remain elusive. Herein, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites are exploited as a new material library of electrode additives. The MOFs imbue infused electrolytes with an expanded electrochemical stability window (0 to 5 V vs Li/Li⁺) and enhanced Li⁺ transport efficiency. Mechanistically, strong interactions between Zr4+ sites and Li+ solvation sheaths result in trimmed, anion‐fixed, and solvent‐separated ion pairs, mitigating electrostatic coupling and enabling efficient Li⁺ translocation in the porous nanospace. Concomitantly, these solvation structural modulations foster interfacial and electrochemical stabilities. When implemented at 1.7 wt.% in graphite and sub‐Ah full cell, the MOF additives significantly improved Li+ diffusional kinetic, rate capability beyond 2C, and cycling longevity doubling lifespan. This work offers a straightforward yet effective route to remedy the bottlenecks of industrial LIBs.

A facile and scalable dual‐solvent strategy is developed to fabricate dendritic ZIF‐67‐D with tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. The reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron‐donating capability lead to significantly improved performance in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis, highlighting the multifunctional potential of ZIF‐67‐D.









Abstract
Metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly versatile materials with tunable chemical and structural properties, making them promising for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis. However, achieving precise control over MOF coordination structures to optimize facet‐dependent properties remains challenging. Here, a facile and scalable dual‐solvent synthesis strategy is presented to fabricate dendrite Co‐2‐methylimidazole MOF (ZIF‐67‐D), enabling tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and synchrotron‐based X‐ray absorption spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that ZIF‐67‐D, enriched with (112) facets, features a reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron‐donating ability compared to the conventionally (011) facet‐dominated rhombic dodecahedron ZIF‐67 (ZIF‐67‐R). This facet engineering boosts TENG charge density by 2.4‐fold, OER current density by 9.9‐fold (@1.65 V), and HER current density by 1.9‐fold (@‐0.3 V). The (112)/(011) facet ratio can be also tuned to precisely alter TENG output. Moreover, the optimized ZIF‐67‐D shows excellent stability, maintaining electrolyzer performance for 72 h and enabling TENG devices even in high humidity. Consequently, ZIF‐67‐D‐based TENG (D‐TENG) devices exhibit robust energy generation and power ZIF‐67‐D||ZIF‐67‐D electrolyzers for continuous hydrogen (H2) production. These findings introduce a new paradigm for converting mechanical energy into sustainable chemical energy, offering insights into facet engineering for high‐performance energy harvesting systems.

A novel 3D template‐catalyzed growth (3D‐TCG) method is developed for kilogram‐scale production of few‐layered 2D nanosheet powders with high efficiency. The template‐catalyzed growth mechanism of this approach enables the high‐quality and controllable lateral sizes from 100 nm to 10 µm of the products, demonstrating promising viability for large‐scale practical applications.








Abstract
Bulk availability of 2D material powders presents broad opportunities for various industrial applications. Particle size and morphology control are critical factors that govern their properties, and in particular, large‐scale size‐controlled production of 2D materials nanosheets remains extremely challenging. Herein, a novel 3D template‐catalyzed growth (3D‐TCG) method is demonstrated that allows the mass production of size‐tunable 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h‐BN) nanosheet powders, a key material in the 2D materials family. Rather than limiting the nanosheet growth on 2D substrate surfaces, this method provides large numbers of active sites distributed in 3D space, leading to the feasibility of scale‐up production with excellent product homogeneity and high efficiency. Ultrathin h‐BN nanosheets are synthesized with high throughput (kilogram quantities) and lateral sizes that can be tuned from 100 nm to 10 µm with thicknesses of few layers. Their practical application is demonstrated in lithium metal batteries, where the obtained nanosheet powders are processed and roll‐to‐roll coated on commercial separators (>10 m2). The prototype pouch cell delivers high energy density (501.8 Wh kg−1) and improved cycling stability. The template‐based large‐scale production strategy can be used to generically produce various types of bulk pristine 2D nanopowders with potential for many large‐scale applications.

Selective C‐H activation is a crucial step in organic molecule transformation. Photocatalytic radicals‐driven C‐H activation is considered a promising approach but suffers from simultaneously utilizing electron/hole pairs which are limited to broad‐band gap semiconductors. A half‐photocathodic reaction strategy is reported for the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde using a narrow‐bandgap porous CuBi2O4 photocathode. The intrinsic Cu+/Cu2+ redox of porous CuBi2O4 catalyzes the photocathodic oxygen reduction, generating H2O2‐derived ·OH radicals that activate the C(sp3)‐H bond, followed by ·O2‐‐mediated oxidation to yield benzaldehyde.








Abstract
Selective C‐H activation is the most important step for organic molecule transformation. Photocatalytic radicals driven C‐H activation is considered a promising route but suffers from simultaneously utilizing electron/hole pairs which are limited to broad‐band gap semiconductors. Herein, a half‐photocathodic reaction strategy is demonstrated to activate and oxygenate C(sp3)‐H bonds of toluene toward selective benzaldehyde production using a narrow‐bandgap CuBi2O4 (CBO) porous photocathode. The intrinsic Cu+/Cu2+ redox of porous CBO photocathode catalyzes the photocathodic oxygen reductive H2O2 to generate ·OH capable of oxidation which activates the C(sp3)‐H bond that is further oxygenated via ·O2− formed of the photocathodic oxygen reduction. As a result, the benzaldehyde selectivity is up to 90%. Impressively, the narrow‐band gap of CBO enables record‐high light‐driven benzaldehyde yields of 111.93 mmol m−2 h−1 with stability of over 20 h. This work opens a green and efficient light‐driven C(sp3)‐H bond oxidation strategy by using a narrow‐bandgap photocathode.

An electron‐rich ɛ‐Keggin cluster CuMo16 is synthesized and can act as an active material is introduced into a hydrogel system for intelligent electronics. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that integrating CuMo16 significantly enhances the intelligent storage performance of flexible electronics, and molecular regulation of CuMo16 content provides an effective strategy for optimizing flexible electronic devices.








Abstract
The fabrication of molecular cluster‐based intelligent energy storage systems remains a significant challenge due to the intricacies of multifunctional integration at the molecular level. In this work, low‐valent metal atoms are successfully encapsulated within ɛ‐type Keggin structures, yielding a novel cluster denoted as CuMo16. This unique structure displayed the characteristic “molybdenum red” coloration, with a high degree of reduction (76.47%), which played a pivotal role in enhancing its electrochemical properties. The specialized configuration significantly enhanced multi‐proton‐coupled electron transfer kinetics, enabling efficient and rapid electron storage and release, with up to thirteen electrons per molecule. To construct an intelligent energy storage device, CuMo16 is employed as a proton‐coupled electron‐active material and embedded within a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, resulting in the flexible, wearable, rechargeable devices. The flexible electronics not only demonstrate real‐time human motion detection but also exhibit remarkable energy storage performance, reaching a peak capacity of 194.19 mAh g−1 and maintaining 68.2% capacity retention after 2500 cycles. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that integrating CuMo16 significantly enhances the intelligent storage performance of flexible electronics, and molecular regulation of CuMo16 content provides an effective strategy for optimizing flexible electronic devices. This study lays the foundation for the development of cluster‐based intelligent energy storage systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work introduces a salt‐segregation strategy for solid polymer electrolytes, which decouples surface and bulk salt distribution to form an ion‐enriched surface layer. The design dramatically enhances the lithium deposition kinetics and suppresses parasitic reactions, empowering Li||LiFePO4 solid‐state batteries with exceptional cycling over 20 000 cycles at high‐rate of 1.12 A g−1.








Abstract
Solid‐polymer electrolytes (SPEs) demonstrate great potential for solid‐state lithium batteries (SSLBs), however, interfacial instability and sluggish ion transport at the interface critically hinder their high‐rate capability and long‐term stability. Here, a novel salt‐segregation methodology with spatial salt grade for SPEs is introduced. This approach leverages the differential solubility of lithium salts and PVDF matrix in a commercially available fluoroethylene carbonate during fabrication, which drives the formation of an ion‐enriched surface layer. The strategy simultaneously enhances interfacial and bulk ionic conductivity while effectively mitigating parasitic reactions. These advancements optimize Li+ flux at the lithium metal interphase, promoting a spherical Li growth with minimized surface area and leading to dense lithium deposition. Consequently, the engineered SPE achieves a remarkable cycling of 500 h in Li||Li cells at 2 mA cm−2. Solid‐state Li||LiFePO4 cells exhibit a record stability for 20 000 cycles at 1.12 A g−1 (2 mg cm−2 LiFePO4 cathode), and a high capacity of 147 mAh g−1 over 300 cycles at 0.84 mA cm−2 under a high‐loading 2 mAh cm−2 cathode. The strategy addresses interfacial limitations in SPEs and further introduces a paradigm shift by emphasizing the critical role of spatial salt‐graded engineering at the surface over uniform ion distribution for stabilizing high‐rate SSLBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel dual‐modification approach, ─NH₂ groups modification and Cu ions coordination, is first imposed on MIL‐125, which greatly improved carrier separation due to the enhanced piezoelectricity of MOFs caused by polarity alteration, leading to exceptional high piezo‐photocatalytic hydrogen production.








Abstract
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) face significant challenges in photocatalysis due to severe carrier recombination. Here, a novel approach is presented that incorporates ─NH2 groups and Cu ions onto MOFs with a MIL‐125 skeleton, forming NH2‐MIL‐125 and Cu‐NH2‐MIL‐125. This modification effectively enhances the polarity of MOFs, evidenced by significantly increased d33 values (from 1.69 to 26.21 pm/V) and notable higher dipole moments (from 6.60 to 25.99 D). Notably, it's the first demonstration of boosting MOFs piezoelectricity via a dual modulation strategy. Moreover, the polarity can be further amplified by ultrasonic vibration based on the positive piezoelectric effect, which is justified by in situ Raman spectra, COMSOL simulations, and DFT calculations, by taking into account the applied pressure. The positive impact of introduced piezoelectric effect in facilitating charge separation and transfer of Cu‐NH2‐MIL‐125, proved by enhanced current response. Consequently, through coupling piezocatalysis and photocatalysis, the H2 production rate of Cu‐NH2‐MIL‐125 can be significantly enhanced to ≈2884.2 µmol·g−1·h−1, 2.76 and 9.92 times higher than that of NH2‐MIL‐125 and MIL‐125, respectively, ranking first in all reported MOF‐based piezo‐photocatalysts. This research demonstrates the prospective opportunity for alleviating the severe carriers recombination problem for MOFs through the implantation of piezoelectric field driving force.

Robust and antioxidative quasi‐solid‐state polymer electrolytes are successfully fabricated with diblock polymer brushes as multifunctional supporting films. On this basis, practical long‐cycling lithium metal batteries are achieved under high areal capacities and high‐voltage conditions.








Abstract
Quasi‐solid‐state polymer electrolytes (QSPEs) have been considered as one of the most promising electrolytes for high‐safety high‐energy‐density lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, their inadequate mechanical properties and instability under high voltages pose significant challenges for practical applications. Herein, robust and antioxidative QSPEs are developed based on a polymer‐brush‐based rigid supporting film (BC‐g‐PLiMTFSI‐b‐PPFEMA, BC: bacterial cellulose, PLiMTFSI: poly(lithium (3‐methacryloyloxypropylsulfonyl) (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide), PPFEMA: poly(2‐(perfluorohexyl)ethyl methacrylate)). The robust BC nanofibril backbone can produce a highly porous supporting structure with outstanding mechanical strength. More importantly, the PLiMTFSI‐b‐PPFEMA side‐chains can not only obviously increase the conversion ratio of easily oxidized monomers in QSPEs, but also possess strong interaction with unstable electrolyte components. With such QSPEs as solid‐state electrolytes, the Li/LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full cell with a high cathode loading (20.3 mg cm−2) exhibits a specific discharge capacity of 200.7 mAh g−1 at 0.5 C and demonstrates a long lifespan of 137 cycles with a highly retained capacity of 170.7 mAh g−1 under a cut‐off voltage of 4.5 V. More importantly, under a high cut‐off voltage of 4.6 V, a high specific capacity of 147.0 mAh g−1 after 187 cycles can be retained for solid‐state Li/LiCoO2 cells. This work provides a feasible development strategy of QSPEs for practical long‐cycling high‐voltage LMBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a breakthrough in overcoming the limitation of slow heat transfer by producing a novel Ni─Mn─In/In composite. The heat transfer property is significantly enhanced due to not only the high thermal conductivity of In metal but also the dense structure reducing phonon scattering. This innovation leads to a substantial increase in thermal conductivity and thermomagnetic generation performance, positioning our composite as a promising candidate for efficient waste heat harvesting.








Abstract
Thermomagnetic generation (TMG) is a potential technology for harvesting low‐grade waste heat. However, the limited heat transfer of TMG materials constrains their practical performance. In this study, low‐melting point metal indium (In) with high thermal conductivity is introduced into a Ni─Mn─In Heusler alloy to fabricate Ni─Mn─In/In TMG composites. The thermal conductivity increased significantly from 14.86 W m−1 K−1 for the Ni─Mn─In alloy to 65.2 W m−1 K−1 for the Ni─Mn─In/In composite. The composite containing 40 wt.% In (In40) exhibits superior TMG performance, with an average voltage of 2.38 mV g−1, a maximum power density of 0.433 µW g−1, and a cost index of 0.116 µW per CNY, which are 3.8, 2.4, and 1.1 times higher than those of the Ni─Mn─In alloy. By further changing the geometry, a 2 mm thick In40 with 7 holes achieves a thermal conductivity 15 times higher and a power generation index 8 orders of magnitude greater than those of other reported TMG materials. The combination of enhanced TMG performance and improved heat transfer, along with zero thermal hysteresis, good machinability, high corrosion resistance, and long‐term cycle stability, makes this composite a strong candidate for low‐grade waste heat recovery applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An AI‐guided design platform (AMP‐hydrogel‐Designer) is developed to design antibacterial biomaterials by integrating thiol‐modified AMPs, hydrogels, and Cu‐BTO. The AI‐designed hydrogel exhibits potent bactericidal efficacy against MRSA and E. coli, promotes angiogenesis via mechano‐electrical signals, and accelerates healing in infected wounds.








Abstract
Traditional biomaterial development lacks systematicity and predictability, posing significant challenges in addressing the intricate engineering issues related to infections with drug‐resistant bacteria. The unprecedented ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to manage complex systems offers a novel paradigm for materials development. However, no AI model currently guides the development of antibacterial biomaterials based on an in‐depth understanding of the interplay between biomaterials and bacteria. In this study, an AI‐guided design platform (AMP‐hydrogel‐Designer) is developed to generate antibacterial biomaterials. This platform utilizes generative design and multi‐objective constrained optimization to generate a novel thiol‐containing high‐efficiency antimicrobial peptide (AMP), that is functionally coupled with hydrogel to form a complex network structure. Additionally, Cu‐modified barium titanate (Cu‐BTO) is incorporated to facilitate further complex cross–linking via Cu2+/SH coordination to produce an AI‐AMP‐hydrogel. In vitro, the AI‐AMP‐hydrogel exhibits > 99.99% bactericidal efficacy against Methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, Cu‐BTO converts mechanical stimulation into electrical signals, thereby promoting the expression of growth factors and angiogenesis. In a rat model with dynamic wounds, the AI‐AMP hydrogel significantly reduces the MRSA load and markedly accelerates wound healing. Therefore, the AI‐guided biomaterial development strategy offers an innovative solution to precisely treat drug‐resistant bacterial infections.

<title>High‐Entropy Doped P'2 Mn‐Based Layered Oxide with Superior Stability and High Capacity for Sodium‐Ion Batteries</title>

High‐entropy doped P'2‐Na0.59Mn0.90Ti0.02Cu0.02Ni0.02Co0.02Fe0.02O1.95F0.05 layered oxide cathode material associated with P'2‐OP4 bi‐phase transition yields superior cyclability (97.8% over 100 cycles) in sodium‐ion batteries. The high‐entropy doping can effectively regulate the energy level splitting of the eg* orbital and crystal fields, thus mitigating the Jahn‐Teller distortion while maintaining the TMO6 octahedra anisotropy.








Abstract
P'2‐NaxMnO2 (NMO) features an ultra‐high specific capacity in sodium‐ion batteries, which, however, suffers from a fast capacity decay. To improve the stability, a high‐entropy doped P'2‐Na0.59Mn0.90Ti0.02Cu0.02Ni0.02Co0.02Fe0.02O1.95F0.05 (NMHE0.1OF) is developed to lessen the Jahn‐Teller distortion and address the multiple phase transition issue. Physicochemical characterizations reveal that the NMHE0.1OF yields a lower anisotropy in the Mn─O bond than does the undoped NMO. Theoretical calculations indicate that the cation doping enhances the coordination ability of oxygen and the F doping breaks the electronic symmetry of Mn. The in situ X‐ray diffraction result reveals that the NMO experiences a more abrupt and irreversible OP4‐P'2‐P″2 tri‐phase transition; and the NMHE0.1OF features a mild and reversible OP4‐P'2 bi‐phase transition, which originates from the alleviation in the contraction/expansion of the transition metal slabs evidenced by ex situ extended X‐ray absorption fine structure. The bi‐phase transition favors the compatibility between the NMHE0.1OF and the ether‐based electrolyte at high voltages. As a result, the NMHE0.1OF yields a superior cyclability (97.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1) with a notable specific capacity of 224 mAh g−1 at 10 mA g−1. This work provides an effective strategy for the rational design of cathode materials with high capacity and superior stability.

This study develops a synthetic membrane with sodium ionophores integrated into a covalent organic framework, mimicking the permselectivity and cation discrimination of biological ion channels. The membrane exhibits high Na+ selectivity, achieving Na+/K+ and Na+/Li+ selectivities of 3.6 and 103, respectively, and improves power density by a 4.6‐fold in the presence of high‐valent cation salts, enhancing energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Biological ion channels achieve remarkable permselectivity and cation discrimination through the synergy of their intricate architectures and specialized ionophores within confined nanospaces, enabling efficient energy conversion. Emulating such selectivity in synthetic nanochannels, however, remains a persistent challenge. To address this, a novel host‐guest assembly membrane is developed by incorporating sodium‐selective ionophores into a β‐ketoenamine‐linked covalent organic framework (COF). This design confers exceptional permselectivity and Na+ selectivity, achieving Na+/K+ and Na+/Li+ selectivity ratios of 3.6 and 103, respectively, along with near‐perfect Na+/Cl− selectivity under a 0.5 M || 0.01 M salinity gradient. Notably, the membrane dynamically switches its permselectivity to favor anion transport in the presence of high‐valent cations (e.g., Ca2+), overcoming limitations such as uphill cation diffusion and back currents observed in conventional cation‐selective membranes. This adaptive behavior yields a 4.6‐fold increase in output power density in Ca2+‐rich environments. These findings advance the design of biomimetic nanochannels with unparalleled ion selectivity and enhanced energy conversion efficiency.

This work presents a new metalgel that immobilizes liquid metal continuum within waterborne polyurethane networks through electrostatic interactions. The polymer network, enriched with dynamic reversible structures, provides a durable structure for repeated stretching. Simultaneously, the electrostatic interactions enable synchronous deformations of both polymer networks and liquid metal. Benefiting from this design, this durable metalgel exhibits a high and stable conductivity of 3 × 106 S∙m−1 even after 1 000 000 stretching cycles. This work overcomes the performance limitations of current conductive elastomers and unlocks new opportunities for cutting‐edge applications.








Abstract
Conductive elastomers are in high demand for emerging fields such as wearable electronics and soft robotics. However, it remains unavailable to realize the desired metal‐level conductivity after extensive stretching cycles, which is a necessity for the above promising application. Here, a new material is presented that employs an elastic, homogeneous, and dense waterborne polyurethane network to immobilize the liquid metal continuum via electrostatic interactions. This new design enables the liquid metal continuum to deform synchronously and reversibly with the polymer network, preserving its conductive structure and significantly enhancing durability. The resulting durable metalgel exhibits conductivity of 3 × 106 S∙m−1, which remains stable after 1 000 000 stretching cycles. This work overcomes the performance limitations of current conductive elastomers and unlocks new opportunities for cutting‐edge applications in wearable technology and robotics.

An effective strategy is presented to fabricate the chiral superstructure elastomers (CSEs) that display selective reflection colors, dynamically tunable CP‐OURTP with robust glum values, full‐color afterglow emissions, and superior processability within a single system.








Abstract
Developing full‐color circularly polarized organic ultralong room‐temperature phosphorescence (CP‐OURTP) materials with high dissymmetry factor (glum) holds significant promise for diverse optoelectronic applications. Controlling glum values is crucial for enhancing the performance and functionality of these materials, as it directly influences their chiroptical properties and potential utilities in advanced technologies. However, achieving reversible and dynamic manipulation of glum in CP‐OURTP materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an effective strategy is presented to fabricate the chiral superstructure elastomers (CSEs) that display selective reflection colors, dynamically tunable CP‐OURTP with robust glum values, full‐color afterglow emissions, and superior processability within a single system. By integrating room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers into the CSEs, CSEs are produced demonstrating tunable CP‐OURTP with glum values switching between 0.8 and 0.15 by mechanical deformation. More importantly, these mechanochromic, programmable, and full‐color CP‐OURTP films enable the development of flexible and dynamic information encryption and decryption. The work provides new insights into the development of novel RTP materials and advances in their potential applications.

<title>Visual Engineering Achieved with Electronegative Carbon Dots for Highly Efficient Ion Flux Regulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The research introduces a novel “visual engineering” strategy using electronegative CDs for dual‐functional separator modification. The CDs enable real‐time UV monitoring of coating uniformity and regulate Li‐ion flux, enhancing battery performance by suppressing dendrite growth and polysulfide shuttling in both lithium‐metal and lithium–sulfur batteries. This innovative approach bridges optics and electrochemistry, offering a versatile solution for advanced energy storage systems.








Abstract
Various modification methods for lithium‐metal battery separators have been well explored in the past decades, among which the most common process is to coat modified slurries onto the separators by blade‐coating method. However, the distribution of the slurries is often non‐uniform in this process, while the uniformity usually needs to be detected by electron microscope, which is time and cost‐consuming. To solve this long‐standing technical issue, it focuses on the “visualization” of modification effect with negatively charged carbon dots under UV light, and deeply investigates the ion transport problem caused by the non‐uniform material modification. With this unique “visual engineering” strategy, uniform separator can be easily detected, which further allows for the construction of a uniform negative shielding layer and cation channels. It accelerates the ion transport process, realizes a stable Li stripping and deposition process, and avoids dendrite growth. To this end, in symmetric batteries with different electrolyte compositions, stable operation of 1200 h can be achieved. In addition, negatively charged polysulfide shuttles can be greatly suppressed, thus avoiding the infamous “shuttle effect” in lithium–sulfur batteries. This work provides a new avenue for screening well‐modified separators through “visual engineering”, further accelerating the practical application of series of rechargeable batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Organic photodiodes (OPDs) with low dark current and stable detectivity under light irradiation, air exposure, and heating are realized using a nanoparticle‐based Zn‐chelated PEIE (PEI‐Zn NP) electron transport layer. This formulation effectively suppresses photocurrent degradation and dark current increase, ensuring enhanced environmental stability and maintained performance after 5000 cycles of device bending.








Abstract
Flexible organic photodiodes (OPDs) are used to detect light in system‐scale demonstrations of skin‐conformable devices. However, the detectivity of OPDs deteriorates under various environmental conditions, such as light irradiation, air exposure, and heating. This decrease in detectivity is observed in OPDs with a widely used sol–gel ZnO (ZnO SG) electron transport layer (ETL), where the dark current at the reverse bias increased by several orders of magnitude. In this study, a low dark current and stable detectivity with respect to the aforementioned external changes are achieved. The enhanced stability stems from the suppression of the increase in dark current realized by using a mixture of an organic polymer, polyethyleneimine (PEIE), and inorganic crystals (ZnO nanoparticles) to create a nanoparticle‐based, Zn‐chelated PEIE (PEI‐Zn NP) as the ETL of the OPDs. The detectivities of OPDs with PEI‐Zn NP are 89%, 84%, and 93% of their original values after light irradiation, air storage, and thermal heating, respectively. In contrast, their ZnO SG counterparts exhibited stabilities of only 9.9%, 55%, and 2.6%, respectively, in the same tests. Furthermore, the use of PEI‐Zn NP ETL in ultraflexible OPDs is demonstrated by the maintained detectivity after 5000 cycles of device bending.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A vanadium‐cobalt (VCo) diatomic catalyst with strong electronic interactions is successfully integrated into vacancy‐rich nitrogen‐doped MXene for room temperature sodium–sulfur (RT/Na─S) batteries. This catalyst exhibits a unique electron spillover effect during sodium polysulfide redox reaction, enhancing polysulfide conversion kinetics and significantly improving cycling stability.









Abstract
Room‐temperature sodium─sulfur (RT/Na─S) batteries, with a theoretical capacity of 1672 mAh g⁻1, face challenges such as the insulating nature of sulfur and slow redox kinetics, particularly during complex liquid–solid (Na2S4→Na2S2) and solid–solid (Na2S2→Na2S) conversions. Herein, vanadium‐cobalt (VCo) diatomic sites implanted in vacancy‐rich N‐doped MXene (VCo DACs/N‐MXene) are introduced to address these issues. The N‐bridged VCo diatomic pairs are demonstrated and their strong electronic interactions are also validated through experimental and theoretical analyses. The RT/Na─S battery with optimized VCo DACs/N‐MXene delivers an average capacity of 1255.3 mAh g⁻1 at 0.1 C and remarkable cycling stability, with only ≈0.001% capacity decay per cycle over 1500 cycles at 1 C. DFT calculations reveal that VCo diatomic sites enhance reaction kinetics by reducing the Gibbs free energy for polysulfide conversions, notably reducing the solid–solid conversion energy barriers from 1.17/0.96 eV for V/Co SACs/N‐MXene to 0.53 eV for VCo DACs/N‐MXene. XANES and DFT analyses attribute this improvement to a unique electron spillover effect, facilitating efficient electron transport during charge and discharge. This work highlights the potential of optimizing electronic configurations and coordinating environments to activate bidirectional kinetics with improved capacity and longevity of RT/Na─S batteries.

Intrinsic, deep defective and surface states are proved in CDs. Hydrogen bonding (HB) is found to be detrimental to surface state emission of CDs through non‐radiative decay pathway, while polarization promoted the surface state emission in a single decay pathway. By eliminating HB and promoting polarization‐induced charge transfer, engineered CDs with fluorescence QY up to 98.1% are synthesized and applied for various applications.








Abstract
Improving the fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of carbon dots (CDs) is essential for expanding their applications. Understanding the photoluminescence mechanism of CDs can provide valuable insights for QY improvement. In this study, it is demonstrated that polarization facilitated the surface state emission of CDs through a single decay pathway, while hydrogen bonding (HB) is identified as a factor that hindered the surface state emission of CDs through non‐radiative decay. Following an in‐depth evaluation of these mechanisms, the QY of CDs is markedly enhanced by engineering molecules onto their surfaces. This strategy not only eliminated HB but also promoted polarization‐induced charge transfer. Notably, the QY of the yellow‐emitting CD is elevated to 98.1%. Capitalizing on their long‐term stability, excellent water solubility, two‐photon excitation capacity, and non‐toxicity, the engineered CDs are successfully applied in dual‐color super‐resolution fluorescence imaging in living cells, two‐photon imaging of zebrafish, and optogenetic regulation in the deep brain of freely‐moving animals.

A unique metal–organic framework (Cr‐TBA), featuring chromium metal sites coordinated with tetrabromoterephthalic acid with a distinctive paper‐clip‐like shape, is successfully synthesized. The enhanced Lewis acidity of Cr‐TBA promotes the accumulation of OH− ions on the catalyst surface. By effectively regulating the local reaction microenvironment, the H2O2 electrosynthesis performances of Cr‐TBA in neutral electrolytes are significantly improved, achieving remarkable Faradaic efficiencies and an excellent H₂O₂ production rate.








Abstract
The electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide represents a promising alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process, aiming for zero pollution. However, achieving efficient electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide in neutral electrolytes is challenging due to the sluggish kinetics of the two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction. To address this issue, a unique metal–organic framework (MOF) featuring Cr metal sites coordinated with tetrabromoterephthalic acid (Cr‐TBA) is synthesized. This specially designed MOF exhibits a distinctive paper‐clip‐like structure and remarkably enhanced Lewis acidity. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained structure can facilitate the attraction of OH− ions in solution, promoting their accumulation on the catalyst surface. This enhancement leads to excellent performances of Cr‐TBA in neutral electrolytes, achieving Faradaic efficiencies of 96–98% and a production rate of 13.4 mol gcat−1 h−1 at the current density of 150 mA cm−2. Operando spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicate that this modified microenvironment effectively facilitates the conversion of the *OOH intermediates to H2O2 on the catalyst surface.

This study investigates the high‐field breakdown and energy dissipation of multilayer PdSe2 FETs, with a focus on the interfacial thermal transport at the PdSe2/SiO2 interface. The research proposes optimization strategies to enhance device performance and improve the thermal management, paving the way for the more efficient next‐generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The continuous miniaturization of 2D electronic circuits results in increased power density during device operation, leading to heat localization and placing higher demands on their performance thresholds. The risk to thermal breakdown and subsequent damage, due to the energy dissipation in the 2D semiconductor field‐effect transistors (FETs) supported on the bulk substrates, represents a significant challenge in maintaining their optimal performance. Herein, this study investigates energy dissipation behavior in multilayer PdSe2 FETs for the first time. The high‐field breakdown behavior is firstly studied in multilayer PdSe2 FETs on SiO2/Si substrates, where a maximum current density of ≈2.74 MA cm−2 is observed, which is comparable to that of multilayer black phosphorus FET and significantly higher—by about five times—than that of multilayer MoS2 FET. Additionally, the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of PdSe2/SiO2 interface is measured at room temperature using Raman thermometry. The TBC is found to be ≈12–13 MW m−2 K−1, which is relatively low compared to the other known solid–solid interfaces, indicating that enhancing the performance of PdSe2 FETs can be possible by optimizing the TBC at the PdSe2/SiO2 interface. These findings provide valuable insights for design of high‐quality and high‐performance PdSe2 electronic and optoelectronic devices.

An in situ multifunctional polymer interface layer with high‐efficiency Zn2+ transport is prepared through the pre‐established ion transport pathways of an innovative electrolyte initiator. This layer promotes rapid Zn2+ desolvation and uniform Zn2+ deposition, effectively suppressing interfacial side reactions and dendrite growths, thereby significantly extending the cycle life of aqueous zinc‐metal batteries.









Abstract
Achieving stable zinc‐metal anodes is pivotal to realizing high‐performance aqueous zinc‐metal batteries (AZMBs). The construction of a functional polymer interface layer on the zinc‐metal anode surface is confirmed as an effective strategy for mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of zinc‐metal anode. However, polymers capable of withstanding electrolyte environments over the long term typically suffer from elevated interfacial impedance, which hinders Zn2+ transport. Here, a pioneering zinc‐metal anode enabled by a functional polymer interface layer with high‐efficiency ion transport is introduced. This polymer layer is polymerized in situ on the zinc‐metal anode surface through an innovative redox initiation system, where zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) salts function as both reductant and ion transport pre‐pathways, ensuring high‐efficiency ion transport. The resultant interface layer achieves an ideal balance of ionic conductivity, water resistance, adhesion, and mechanical properties, effectively suppressing dendrite growth and side reactions. Symmetric cells assembled with this interface layer deliver an impressive lifespan of 8800 and 1600 h under 1 and 5 mA cm−2, respectively. This interface layer further demonstrates exceptional feasibility and versatility in Zn‐NVO and Zn‐PANI batteries. This work provides groundbreaking insights into the strategic design of high‐performance polymer interface layers for AZMBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multiple resonances thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter is developed by synergizing multiple charge‐transfer excited states, exhibiting excellent photoluminescence properties with a narrowband emission of 21 nm, rapid reverse intersystem crossing rate of 7.8 × 105 s−1 and suppressed concentration quenching, and electroluminescence performances with high maximum external quantum efficiencies and low‐efficiency roll‐offs in wide doping concentrations ranges of 3–50 wt.%.








Abstract
The development of multiple resonances thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR‐TADF) emitters exhibiting high efficiency, narrowband emission, rapid reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC), and suppressed concentration quenching simultaneously is of great significance yet a formidable challenge. Herein, an effective strategy is presented to realize the above target by synergizing multiple charge‐transfer excited states, including short‐range charge transfer (SRCT), through‐bond charge transfer (TBCT), and through‐space charge transfer (TSCT). The proof‐of‐concept emitter 4tCz2B exhibits a bright green emission with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 21 nm (0.10 eV) in solution, high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, fast kRISC of 7.8 × 105 s−1 and significantly suppressed concentration quenching in film state. As a result, the sensitizer‐free organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) achieve maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmaxS) of over 34.5% together with an unaltered emission peak at 508 nm and FWHM of 26 nm at doping concentrations ranging from 3 to 20 wt.%. Even at a doping ratio of 50 wt.%, EQEmax is still as high as 25.5%. More importantly, the non‐sensitized devices exhibit significantly reduced efficiency roll‐offs, with a minimum value of 13.4% at a brightness of 1000 cd m−2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An alcogel‐based vertical thermal diode smart wall with interfacial evaporation for ambient thermal energy harvesting and spontaneous cooling/heating supply to the built environment. Owing to the vertical thermal diode structure design, the evaporation‐condensation‐based smart wall (ECSW) features flexible climate‐adaptative heat transfer characteristics with a heat transfer coefficient from 3.33 to ≈30 W m−2 K−1 and building energy savings at 66.47% in Kunming.








Abstract
Traditional building envelopes with constant thermophysical properties constrain their capabilities in temperature regulation. Whether it is possible to achieve single‐direction heat transfer along building envelopes with climate‐adaptative thermophysical properties to enhance passive heat gain in winter and thermal dissipation in summer? In this work, through the capillary effect in interfacial evaporation and thermal diode structure, single‐direction heat transfer with passively adjustable thermal properties in a vertical building envelope is practically achieved. An evaporation‐condensation‐based smart wall (ECSW) is manufactured for spontaneous and continuous cooling/heating supply to the built environment. The ECSW features climate‐adaptative heat transfer characteristics with heat transfer coefficient transiting from 3.33 to ≈30 W m−2 K−1. Additionally, coupling with radiant cooling and photothermal capabilities, ECSW shows excellent thermal performances, i.e., a heat transfer at 5.44 W m−2 by radiant cooling with a 5 °C cooler surface, and a heat transfer at 387.68 W m−2 under solar illumination at 1000 W m−2. Simulation results show that the ECSW enables building energy savings at 66.47% in Kunming. This study first reports vertical thermal diode building envelopes utilizing natural heating/cooling sources through interfacial evaporation for passive temperature regulation with low costs, performance stability and energy‐saving potentials for smart and sustainable buildings.

<title>Modulating the Spatio‐Temporal Sequence of Lithium Plating and Stripping via a 3D Host for Solid State Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A mixed ionic‐electronic conducting 3D host is employed in solid‐state batteries to modulate lithium plating and stripping behaviors, which can occur away from the interface to tackle dendrite and void formation issues. In situ electron microscopies and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the Li transport pathways in carbon‐based Li metal anodes, which enable faster Li diffusion and high stripping capacity.








Abstract
Solid‐state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are now under intensive research for their high energy density and excellent safety. However, the Li transport limitation in Li metal anode (LMA) leads to mass/stress accumulation, dendrite initiation and void formation at the interface, which seriously hinders the development of SSLMBs. Herein, it is demonstrated through in situ electron microscopies that a mixed ionic‐electronic conducting (MIEC) 3D host can promote the Li transport in LMA by increasing the diffusion pathways along the carbonaceous framework, carbon/Li interface and Li metal surface, enabling a fast and long‐distance (nearly 100 µm) diffusion of Li atoms in LMA. Consequently, the spatio‐temporal sequence of Li plating/stripping can be fundamentally changed. Specifically, both deposition and dissolution can occur far away from the interface, thereby mitigating the dendrite and void issues. Impressively, the resulting cells with carbonaceous hosts can achieve excellent cyclability and the highest capacity (28.8 mAh cm−2) so far. This work provides valuable insight for understanding Li transport and deposition/dissolution mechanisms in MIEC host‐based LMAs, and a feasible solution for tackling the interface issues without involving stack pressure in SSLMBs.

<title>Heterogeneous Nanopore Arrays – Selective Modification of Nanopores Embedded in a Membrane</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Biological processes rely on the concerted action of channels with different functionalities embedded in the same membrane. Inspired by nature, heterogeneous nanopore arrays are prepared where two nanopores are connected in parallel and function as two different elements of an ionic circuit: a diode and a resistor. The results provide the basis to design ionic circuits that mimic physiological processes and communication.








Abstract
Much effort in the field of nanopore research has been directed toward reproducing the efficient transport phenomena of biological ion channels. For synthetic nanopores to replicate channel function on the scale of a cellular membrane, it is necessary to consider the modes of crosstalk between channels as well as to develop approaches to prepare nanopore arrays consisting of pores with different transport properties, akin to a membrane in an axon. In this manuscript, first ion concentration polarization (ICP) is identified as the primary means of the crosstalk, and subsequently, the extent and degree of ICP is tuned via targeted chemical modification of the pore walls’ functional groups. Next, two fabrication methods of a model two‐nanopore array are presented in a silicon nitride membrane in which one nanopore contains a bipolar ionic junction and functions as an ionic diode, while the other one is a homogeneously charged ionic resistor. The targeted chemical modification of a thin gold layer at the opening of one pore in an array that leaves the other pore located a few tens of nm away, unmodified, is utilized. These results provide an important framework for designing abiotic ionic circuits that can mimic physiological multichannel ion transport and communication.

<title>Surface Engineering of PtSe2 Crystal for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D PtSe2 has been demonstrated as high‐performance catalyst for electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation. Plasma treatment engineers the surface of single‐crystalline PtSe2 by removing Se atoms, resulting in the exposure of PtSe2 (101) facet. Excellent EOR activity and poison‐resistance are demonstrated, which is rationalized by in situ electrical transport measurement and theoretical calculations.









Abstract

The development of efficient electrocatalysts for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) is crucial for the potential commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, yet it faces significant challenges between catalytic performance and cost‐effectiveness. 2D materials have recently emerged as a promising group of electrocatalysts due to their large surface area, efficient charge transport, tunable band structures, and excellent catalytic activity. In this study, the novel 2D layered noble‐metal dichalcogenide, PtSe2, is explored for efficient ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis from a microscopic perspective based on an on‐chip microelectrochemical platform. While pristine PtSe2 demonstrates similar EOR activities to Pt, argon plasma treatment significantly enhances the performance on EOR activity, If/Ib ratio, onset and peak potentials, and durability. Detail investigations reveal that plasma treatment results in the exposure of PtSe2 surface, which is responsible for significantly enhanced EOR activity and poison‐resistance as also confirmed by theoretical calculations. In situ electrical transport measurements for monitoring the catalyst surface intermediates, elucidate that both optimized OHads coverage and appropriate ethanol molecular adsorption on PtSe2 are the key for the high performance. This work demonstrates noble‐metal dichalcogenides as promising EOR electrocatalysts, and establishes on‐chip electrocatalytic microdevice as a promising probing platform for diverse electrocatalytic measurements.

<title>Modulating Active Center Microenvironment in Phthalocyanine‐Based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 to CH3OH</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The catalytic cage with carboxyl groups in PEH‐COF stabilized the [K(H2O)n]+ ions, which enhanced the PCET kinetics of the conversion for intermediates to methanol, and ultimately allows the PEH‐COF to exhibit stable operation at a jCH3OH$\mathrm{j}_{{CH}_3OH}$ of ≈100 mA cm−2.








Abstract
Developing catalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 to CH3OH still faces great challenge due to the involvement of multiple proton‐coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes. Molecular phthalocyanine electrocatalysts on carbon nanotubes have achieved production of methanol as the sole liquid‐phase product but with the activity and stability far from meeting industrial demands. Herein, phthalocyaninato cobalt is fabricated into covalent organic frameworks PE‐COF via polymerization with ellagic acid. Subsequent hydrolyzation of the ester groups in this framework affords COOH/OH‐containing PEH‐COF, resulting in the successful modulation over the local microenvironment of Co as electrochemical active center and in turn rendering the production of CH3OH with high yield and durability. Experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that construction of the COOH group and H2O participated catalytic cages in PEH‐COF can effectively fix hydrated potassium ions, which efficiently enhances the PCET kinetics and lowers the energy barriers for the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. The partial current density (j) and Faraday efficiency of methanol for PEH‐COF could reach 100.9 mA cm−2 and 38.5%, respectively. Moreover, the jCH3OH$\mathrm{j}_{{CH}_3OH}$ of PEH‐COF can be maintained at 100.4 mA cm−2 after 9 h of electrocatalysis, superior to the thus far reported catalysts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Disorder in a crystal is rarely randomly distributed but instead can involve extra chemical order. This could offer a new degree of freedom that is essential to designing materials with emergent properties. This research achieves the continuous regulation of vacancy order from long‐range order to short‐range order in cation‐deficient half‐Heusler crystals. Engagingly, various functionalities present significant changes accompanying the evolution of vacancy order.









Abstract
Extra chemical order within periodic crystalline lattices offers a promising approach for designing materials with emergent functionalities. However, achieving tunable extra chemical order in crystalline materials remains challenging. Here, it is found that the vacancy order in cation‐deficient half‐Heusler crystals V1‐

δ
CoSb can be tuned from long‐range order (LRO) to short‐range order (SRO), or vice versa. The vacancy LRO and SRO configurations are uncovered by scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Remarkably, the evolution of vacancy order induces profound changes in electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties, as well as hydrogen storage characteristics. In particular, the electronic density of state effective mass exhibits a nearly threefold increase, while ferromagnetism emerges from infancy when tuning the vacancy order from LRO to SRO. These results elucidate the local chemical order‐property relationship and highlight the great potential of achieving desirable functionalities by designing extra chemical order in crystalline solids.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High‐efficiency narrowband emissive themally activated delayed flurescence (TADF) polymers are realized by incorporating silicon─carbon σ‐bond saturated spacers between multiresonance TADF units and polycarbazole backbone. The polymers exhibit a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 97% and external quantum efficiency of up to 30.2% with a narrow full width at half maximum of 42 nm in organic light‐emitting diodes.








Abstract
Achieving both high‐efficiency and narrowband emission in thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) polymers remains a formidable challenge. In this work, a proof of concept for narrowband‐emissive TADF polymers with a partially conjugated structure is proposed by embedding a silicon─carbon σ‐bond saturated spacer between the multiresonance (MR) TADF unit and the polycarbazole backbone. A series of TADF polymers PSix (x = 1, 3, and 6) is then prepared and characterized. All the polymers show narrowband emission with full width at half maximum (FWHM) values of 28–30 nm in a toluene solution. Impressively, polymer PSi3 has the highest photoluminescence quantum yield, reaching 97%, in the doped films due to the efficient reverse intersystem crossing process. The solution‐processed devices based on PSi3 exhibit the best performance with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 28.8% and an FWHM of 42 nm. By employing the TADF molecule 5Cz‐TRZ as the sensitizer, enhanced device performance with an EQEmax of 30.2% is achieved, which is in the first tier among the MR‐TADF polymers reported to date. This work provides an effective strategy for achieving highly efficient and narrowband‐emissive TADF polymers by controlling the σ‐bond saturated spacer between the MR‐TADF chromophore and the polymer backbone.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A noninvasive second near‐infrared long‐wavelength nanosensor (C8R‐DSNP) for real‐time monitoring of immune cell‐tumor interactions in vivo is reported. The sensor detects caspase‐8 activation during natural killer cells‐induced apoptosis in tumor cells, providing dynamic, early‐stage imaging within 4.5 h of treatment. This approach offers valuable insights for optimizing immunocytotherapy strategies with rapid, in vivo feedback.








Abstract
Immunocytotherapy holds significant promise as a novel cancer treatment, but its effectiveness is often hindered by delayed responses, requiring evaluations every 2–3 weeks based on current diagnostic methods. Early assessment of immune cell‐tumor cell interactions could provide more timely insights into therapeutic efficacy, enabling adjustments to treatment plans. In this study, a noninvasive nanosensor (C8R‐DSNP) for real‐time monitoring of in vivo immune cell activities in the second near‐infrared long‐wavelength (NIR‐II‐L) window (1500–1900 nm), which offers deep tissue transparency, is reported. The C8R‐DSNP responds rapidly to caspase‐8, a key apoptotic signaling molecule generated during interactions between natural killer (NK‐92) cells and tumor cells. Using ratiometric NIR‐II‐L fluorescence imaging, dynamic in vivo observations of NK‐92 cells' engagement with tumor cells in a mouse model are captured. These results demonstrate tumor cells apoptosis that happens as early as 4.5 h after NK‐92 cells infusion. Additionally, in vitro urine imaging confirmed the initiation of apoptosis via cleaved fluorescent small molecules, while single‐cell tracking within blood vessels and tumors further elucidated immune cell dynamics. This real‐time NIR‐II‐L monitoring approach offers valuable insights for optimizing immunocytotherapy strategies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents a novel composite solid‐state polymer electrolyte incorporated dielectric BaTiO3 nanofillers (PDB) for advanced high‐voltage all‐solid‐state lithium batteries. The design achieves a tailored coordination structure, diminished space charge layer, improved ion transport, and enhanced oxidative stability, making this approach a promising strategy for practical long‐cycling all‐solid‐state lithium batteries.








Abstract
The poor structural stability of polymer electrolytes and sluggish ion transport kinetics of interfaces with cathode limit the fundamental performance improvements of polymer all‐solid‐state lithium metal batteries under high voltages. Herein, it is revealed that by introducing dielectric BaTiO3 in an in‐situ polymerized composite solid‐state electrolyte, the generated interaction between the ether group of polymer electrolyte and dielectric material could effectively regulate the lithium‐ion (Li+) coordination structure to achieve an oxidative potential higher than 5.2 V. The dielectric BaTiO3 with spontaneous polarization also weakens the space charge layer effect between the cathode and electrolyte, facilitating fast Li+ transport kinetics across the cathode/electrolyte interfaces. The all‐solid‐state LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li batteries with the dielectric composite solid‐state electrolyte exhibit an ultra‐long cycling life of 1800 and 1300 cycles at room temperature under high cut‐off voltages of 4.6 and 4.7 V, respectively. This work highlights the critical role of dielectric materials in high‐performance solid‐state electrolytes and provides a promising strategy to realize high‐voltage long‐life all‐solid‐state lithium metal batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A Li plating regulation strategy that transforms dead Li plating into reversible active Li plating is proposed by using a lithium dendrite inhibitor to realize safe and long‐lifespan LIBs. Remarkably, only 1 wt.% single‐atom manganese (SAMn) in the Gr anode (Gr‐SAMn) is sufficient to achieve a significant improvement, and the amount of dead Li on the Gr anode can be reduced by 90%.








Abstract
Under harsh conditions, such as high‐rate and low‐temperature charging, part of Li ions cannot intercalate into the graphite (Gr) particles and will form dendrite‐like Li plating, causing capacity fading and serious safety hazards in commercial lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs). Herein, instead of eliminating the Li plating, a Li plating regulation strategy that transforms dead Li plating into reversible active Li plating is proposed by using a lithium dendrite inhibitor to realize safe and long‐lifespan LIBs. Remarkably, only 1 wt.% single‐atom manganese (SAMn) in the Gr anode (Gr‐SAMn) is sufficient to achieve a significant improvement, thus both the volumetric and mass‐energy density remain roughly unaffected. The amount of dead Li on the Gr anode can be reduced by 90%, thereby enabling much‐improved pouch cell performance at high rates and low temperatures. The capacity retention of the Gr‐SAMn||NCM811 pouch cell is 86.2% (23.0% higher than that of the pristine Gr||NCM811 pouch) for 1500 cycles at 2 C, and the cell can even be cycled at 5C charge. Even cycling at −20 °C, the average coulombic efficiency (CE) can be improved from 97.95% to 99.94% by using SAMn additive. Hence, this promising strategy provides a novel alternative to solve the Li plating issue.

<title>Regulating Carrier Transport Behavior for Capacitive Energy Storage of Polymer Dielectrics in Harsh Environments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The carrier transport behavior is regulated rather than the previously oversimplified limitation strategy to reduce losses and enhance energy storage efficiency. It is expected to offer a novel and effective theoretical basis for the design and fabrication of advanced polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy storage level at harsh environments.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy‐storage levels in harsh environments have become key components in electrostatic capacitors. However, excessive losses in polymer dielectrics caused by high carrier densities at high temperatures and strong electric fields often result in low energy storage efficiency, which is the most challenging problem that urgently needs to be solved. In existing studies, the losses are mainly suppressed by limiting carrier formation; however, it is very challenging to completely limit carrier formation, especially at high temperatures and strong electric fields. Therefore, this perspective proposes to regulate the carrier transport behavior through “guiding/constraining/blocking” forms rather than the previously oversimplified carrier limitation strategy, which further clarifies dominant structure factors that inhibit carrier transport to reduce losses and enhance energy storage efficiency. Meanwhile, the influence of different structural designs on carrier transport behavior, individually or collaboratively, must be systematically studied to determine the specific mode of carrier transport behavior, thereby establishing a relationship between carrier transport behavior and energy storage efficiency. The presented perspective is expected to offer a novel and effective theoretical basis for the design and fabrication of advanced polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy storage levels in harsh environments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The degradable additive couple is developed to enable pure and preferential‐oriented α‐FAPbI3 perovskite with a bandgap of 1.489 eV and robustness against light, heat, and moisture over 1000 h, without the additive residue. The resultant perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.20% with a short current density of 26.40 mA cm−2 and long‐term operational stability of over 1000 h.








Abstract
Pure black‐phase FAPbI3 has always been pursued because of its ideal bandgap (Eg) and high thermal stability. Here, a pair of sacrificial agents containing diethylamine hydrochloride (DEACl) and formamide (Fo) is reported, which can induce the oriented growth of black‐phase FAPbI3 along (111) and will disappear by the aminolysis reaction during perovskite annealing, retaining the Eg of FAPbI3 as 1.49 eV. In addition, the tensile strain of the target FAPbI3 is found to be mitigated with a stabilized black phase due to the tilt of FA+. The devices based on the pure and stable black‐phase (111)‐FAPbI3 achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.2% and 24.2% (certified 23.51%) with an aperture area of 0.09 and 1.04 cm2, respectively. After 1080 h of operation at the maximum power point under 1‐sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), the devices maintained 91.68 ± 0.72% of the initial efficiencies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A versatile assembly method is developed to uniformly assemble 2D single‐crystal copper nanosheets (Cu NS) onto substrates with complex shapes via ultrasonication process. This technique leverages cavitation effects to deposit monolayer Cu NS films with minimal overlap. The assembly is optimized by tuning solvent polarity and substrate surface energy. Demonstrated applications include a resistive heater, highlighting the potential in flexible electronics.








Abstract
Scalable and cost‐effective fabrication of conductive films on substrates with complex geometries is crucial for industrial applications in electronics. Herein, an ultrasonic‐driven omni‐directional and selective assembly technique is introduced for the uniform deposition of 2D single‐crystalline copper nanosheets (Cu NS) onto various substrates. This method leverages cavitation‐induced forces to propel Cu NS onto hydrophilic surfaces, enabling the formation of monolayer films with largely monolayer films with some degree of nanosheet overlap. The assembly process is influenced by solvent polarity, nanosheet concentration, and ultrasonic parameters, with non‐polar solvents significantly enhancing Cu NS adsorption onto hydrophilic substrates. Furthermore, selective assembly is achieved by patterning hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions on the substrate, ensuring precise localization of Cu NS films. The practical potential of this approach is demonstrated by fabricating a Cu NS‐coated capillary tube heater, which exhibits excellent heating performance at low operating voltages. This ultrasonic‐driven and selective assembly method offers a scalable and versatile solution for producing conductive films with tailored geometries, unlocking new possibilities for applications in flexible electronics, energy storage, and wearable devices with complex structural requirements.

This study introduce a novel approach to enhancing cathode‐SPE compatibility by utilizing the same poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)‐based material in both the SPE and the cathode binder. A modified biomass‐based PolyIL substrate, enriched with highly negatively charged C═O and ─OH groups, is incorporated into the SPE to improve Li+ migration and strengthen its mechanical properties. The Li||LiFePO₄ cell, assembled via in situ photopolymerization, demonstrate stable cycling for over 1100 cycles, while the Li||NCM811 cell operated reliably at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.8 V for 100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer higher energy density and enhance safety compared to the Li‐ion batteries that use a graphite anode and organic electrolytes. However, achieving long cycle life for LMBs while enabling the use of high‐voltage cathodes required the compatibility between cathode‐SPE, rather than focusing solely on the individual components. This study presente a dual‐functional poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)‐based material that simultaneously serves as an SPE matrix and a cathode binder, constructing a cathode‐SPE interface with exceptional (electro)chemical compatibility owing to the high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. Additionally, a modified cellulose acetate (CA)‐based PolyIL substrate, enriched with C═O and ─OH groups, is designed rationally and incorporated to assist the Li+ migration, leveraging their highly negative charge, and enhancing the mechanical strength of the SPE. Furthermore, an in situ polymerization approach is employed to assemble the cells, improving the physical compatibility at the cathode‐SPE interface. As a result, the Li||LFP cell demonstrate stable cycling beyond 1100 cycles, and the Li||NCM811 cell reliably operates at a high cut‐off voltage of up to 4.8 V.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Synthesis of topological semimetal TaAs2 nanowires in situ encapsulated with a thin SiO2 shell unravel a richness of intertwined topological phases manifested by their magnetotransport features: A near‐room‐temperature metal‐to‐insulator transition, strong expressions of topologically nontrivial surface transport, giant magnetoresistance with direction‐dependent sign reversal, chiral anomaly, and a unique double pattern of Aharonov–Bohm oscillations.








Abstract
Nanowires (NWs) of topological materials are emerging as an exciting platform to probe and engineer new quantum phenomena that are hard to access in bulk phase. Their quasi‐1D geometry and large surface‐to‐bulk ratio unlock new expressions of topology and highlight surface states. TaAs2, a compensated semimetal, is a topologically rich material harboring nodal‐line, weak topological insulator (WTI), C2‐protected topological crystalline insulator, and Zeeman field‐induced Weyl semimetal phases. We report the synthesis of TaAs2 NWs in situ encapsulated in a dielectric SiO2 shell, which enable to probe rich magnetotransport phenomena, including metal‐to‐insulator transition and strong signatures of topologically nontrivial transport at remarkably high temperatures, direction‐dependent giant positive, and negative magnetoresistance, and a double pattern of Aharonov–Bohm oscillations, demonstrating coherent surface transport consistent with the two Dirac cones of a WTI surface. The SiO2‐encapsulated TaAs2 NWs show room‐temperature conductivity up to 15 times higher than bulk TaAs2. The coexistence and susceptibility of topological phases to external stimuli have potential applications in spintronics and nanoscale quantum technology.

<title>Self‐Regulating the Local Conjugation of Tertiary Aniline toward Highly Stable Polymer Li Metal Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A thermo‐electrochemically compatible polymer electrolyte is proposed with a locally conjugated structure through self‐regulation of paired tertiary anilines coupled with in situ polymerization, which significantly reconstructs an improved Li+ solvation and enhances electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability of LMBs. This concept provides an important theoretical basis and technical means for achieving practical high energy/power density LMBs.








Abstract
Pursuing high energy/power density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with good safety and lifespan is essential for developing next‐generation energy‐storage devices. Nevertheless, the uncontrollable degradation of the electrolyte and the subsequent formation of inferior electrolyte/electrode interfaces present formidable challenges to this endeavor, especially when paring with transition metal oxide cathode. Herein, a fireproof polymeric matrix with a local conjugated structure is constructed by 4,4′‐methylenebis (N, N‐diglycidylaniline) (NDA) monomer via in situ polymerization, which promotes the use of ester‐based liquid electrolyte for highly stable LMBs. The conjugated tertiary anilines in this PNDA electrolyte effectively tune the Li+ solvation sheath and generate conformal protective layers on the electrode surfaces, resulting in excellent compatibility with both high‐voltage cathodes and Li‐metal anodes. Moreover, the accumulated electron density endows PNDA with a powerful capability to seize and eliminate the corrosive hydrofluoric acid, which strikingly mitigates the irreversible structure transformation of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC) particles. As a result, the PNDA‐based Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NMC cells reach excellent electrochemical and safety performance. This study provides a promising strategy for the macromolecular design of electrolytes and emphasizes the importance of “local conjugation” within the polymers for LMBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An efficient and safe circular‐RNA delivery system circSCMH1@LNP1 is developed for direct nose‐to‐brain delivery of circRNA SCMH1 to ischemic lesions. Experiments demonstrate that intranasally administrated circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly accumulates in the peri‐infarct region of PT stroke mice, thereby improving functional recovery by enhancing synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke represents one of the leading cerebrovascular diseases with a high rate of mortality and disability globally. To date, there are no effective clinical drugs available to improve long‐term outcomes for post‐stroke patients. A novel nucleic acid agent circSCMH1 which can promote sensorimotor function recovery in rodent and nonhuman primate animal stroke models has been found. However, there are still delivery challenges to overcome for its clinical implementation. Besides, its effects on post‐stroke cognitive functions remain unexplored. Herein, lipid nanoparticle circSCMH1@LNP1 is established to deliver circSCMH1 and explore its therapeutic efficacy comprehensively. Distribution experiments demonstrate that intranasal administration of circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly increases circSCMH1 distribution in the peri‐infarct region and reduces its non‐specific accumulation in other organs compared to intravenous injection. Therapeutic results indicate that circSCMH1@LNP1 promotes synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation, thereby achieving enhanced sensorimotor and cognitive function recovery in post‐stroke mice. In conclusion, this research presents a simple and effective LNP system for efficient delivery of circSCMH1 via intranasal administration to repair post‐stroke brain injury. It is envisioned that this study may bridge a crucial gap between basic research and translational application, paving the way for clinical implementation of novel circSCMH1 in post‐stroke patient management.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Super‐hard wood‐based composites (WBC) are designed and developed inspired by the mesoscale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth. This innovative hybrid structure is achieved by leveraging the infusion of low‐molecular‐weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi‐layer construction and high‐temperature compression.








Abstract
The growing demand for high‐strength, durable materials capable of enduring extreme environments presents a significant challenge, particularly in balancing performance with sustainability. Conventional materials such as alloys and ceramics are nonrenewable, expensive, and require energy‐intensive production processes. Here, super‐hard wood‐based composites (WBC) inspired by the meso‐scale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth are designed and developed. This hybrid structure is achieved innovatively by leveraging the infusion of low‐molecular‐weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi‐layer construction and high‐temperature compression. The resulting composite exhibits remarkable properties, including a Janka hardness of 24 382 N and a Brinell hardness of 40.7 HB, along with exceptional antipiercing performance. The created super‐hard, sustainable materials address the limitations of nonrenewable resources while providing enhanced protection, structural stability, and exceptional resilience. The WBC approach aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering extra values for improving personal safety and building integrity across various engineering applications.

<title>Hot‐Exciton‐Involved Dual‐Channel Stepwise Energy Transfer Enabling Efficient and Stable Blue OLEDs with Narrow Emission and High Luminance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A tailor‐made blue organic emitter with hot exciton and aggregation‐induced emission characteristics serves as a sensitizer in the innovative sensitizing system with a dual‐channel stepwise energy transfer feature. The established material and device approach enables efficient, stable blue organic light‐emitting diodes with narrow emission and low‐efficiency roll‐off at high luminance.








Abstract
Marching toward next‐generation ultrahigh‐definition and high‐resolution displays, the development of high‐performance blue organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrow emission and high luminance is essential and requires conceptual advancements in both molecular and device design. Herein, a blue organic emitter is reported that exhibits hot‐exciton and aggregation‐induced emission characteristics, and use it as a sensitizer in the proposed triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA)‐assisted hot‐exciton‐sensitized fluorescence (HSF) device, abbreviated THSF. Results show that through dual‐channel stepwise Förster and Dexter energy transfer processes, the THSF system can simultaneously enhance exciton utilization, accelerate exciton dynamics, and reduce the concentration of triplet excitons. The smooth management of excitons makes the overall performance of the THSF device superior to the control TTA fluorescence and HSF devices. Furthermore, a high‐performance narrowband blue (CIEx,y = 0.13, 0.12) OLED is achieved using a two‐unit tandem device design, providing an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency of 18.3%, a record‐high L90% (the luminance where the ƞext drops to 90% of its peak value) of ≈20 000 cd m−2, and a long half‐lifetime at 100 cd m−2 initial luminance of ≈13 256 h. These results showcase the great potential of the THSF strategy in realizing efficient and stable blue OLEDs with narrow emission and high luminance.

<title>LiC6@Li as a Promising Substitution of Li Metal Counter Electrode for Low‐Temperature Battery Evaluation</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419041?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419041?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work developed a LiC6@Li counter electrode, as an alternative to Li metal for more precisely evaluating the electrochemical behavior of electrode materials at low temperatures. The low interfacial resistances facilitate preferential de‐intercalation of Li+ from LiC6, resulting in a sharp decreased over‐potential at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the rapid replenishment of Li+ through the solid–solid‐connection reaction maintains stable LiC6@Li potential.








Abstract
Li metal, as a counter electrode, is widely used for electrode materials evaluation in coin type half‐cells. However, whether this configuration is suitable for different working conditions has often been neglected. Herein, the large resistance and high cathodic/anodic over‐potential of Li metal at low temperature are highlighted, revealing its incompetence as counter electrode on cryogenic condition. In view of this, a novel LiC6@Li composite electrode is developed as a promising substitution for electrode materials evaluation. In the LiC6@Li electrode, Li+ de‐intercalated from LiC6 preferentially due to the low interface resistance of LiC6, presenting a cathodic/anodic over‐potential of 0.05 V (67 µA cm−2) at −20 °C, which is ten times lower than that of Li metal. Moreover, the rapid lithium replenishment into LiC6 from Li metal enables a stable potential of LiC6@Li. Consequently, the LiC6@Li‐based half‐cells enabled more precise evaluation of the Li+ storage potential and specific capacities of a series of electrode materials at low temperature. As an extension, KC8@K is also successfully prepared as a superior counter electrode to K metal. This work proposes a suitable counter electrode for more accurately evaluating electrode materials at subfreezing scenarios, demonstrating the necessity of specialized electrode evaluation systems for particular operating conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The fabricated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O‐CN gels), via the synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training, achieve cartilage‐like structure and mechanical performances, as well as high‐water retention similar to cartilage. The resulting O‐CN gels has excellent prospects in load‐bearing cartilage engineering application.








Abstract
Cartilage, as a load‐bearing tissue with high‐water content, exhibits excellent elasticity and high strength. However, it is still a grand challenge to develop cartilage‐adaptive biomaterials for replacement or regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue. Herein, protein templating and mechanical training is integrated to fabricate crystal‐mediated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O‐CN gels) with similar mechanical properties and water content of cartilage. The O‐CN gels with an ≈74 wt% water content exhibit high tensile strength (≈15.4 MPa) and Young's modulus (≈24.1 MPa), as well as excellent biocompatibility, antiswelling properties, and antibacterial capabilities. When implanted in the box defect of rat's tails, the O‐CN gels seal the cartilage (annulus fibrosus) defect, maintain the intervertebral disc height and finally prevent the nucleus herniation. This synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training opens up a new possibility to design highly mechanical hydrogels, especially for the replacement and regeneration of load‐bearing tissues.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel composite proton exchange membrane (PEM) design that leverages carboxylic acid‐functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM‐1) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Harnessing Lewis acid‐base interactions enables the development of a synergistic microporous structure that confines phosphoric acid clusters, enhancing proton conductivity and durability. This work addresses critical challenges in PEM development, while proposing a solutionfor the design of next‐generation membranes.









Abstract
High‐temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT‐PEMFCs) is regarded as a promising energy conversion system owing to simplified water management and enhanced tolerance to fuel impurities. However, phosphoric acid (PA) leaching remains a critical issue, diminishing energy density and durability, posing significant obstacle to the commercial development of HT‐PEMFCs. To address this, composite membranes incorporating the carboxylic acid‐modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM‐1) are designed as framework polymer, blended with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for HT‐PEMFCs. The Lewis acid‐base interactions between cPIM‐1 and PVP created an extensive hydrogen‐bonding network, improving membrane compatibility. The optimized microporous structure and multiple anchoring sites gave rise to “domain‐limited” PA clusters, enhancing the capillary effect. Simultaneously, improved hydrophobicity synergistically optimizes catalytic interface, promoting continuous and stable proton transfer. The HT‐PEMFCs based on PVP/cPIM‐1 composite membrane achieved a peak power density of 1090.0 mW cm−2 at 160 °C, representing a 152% improvement compared to PVP/PES membrane. Additionally, it demonstrated excellent durability, with a voltage decay of 0.058 mV h−1 over 210 h of accelerated stress test corresponds to more than 5000 h of constant current density durability test. This study presents a promising strategy for the development of high‐performance and durable novel membranes in various energy conversion systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The first case of orthogonal integration of holographic and phosphorescent images is demonstrated, providing a novel paradigm for high‐security level information encryption and advanced anticounterfeiting.








Abstract
Organic room temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) polymer materials have sparked considerable research interests in recent years, but their optical function is still limited for multi‐mode optical imaging. Herein, a feasible and universal approach is proposed to endow ORTP polymer materials with periodic refractive index modulation functions by holographic patterning. The key to this approach is to design a two‐stage stepwise crosslinking. Stage‐1, with low crosslinking density (≤0.75 mol L−1), is phosphorescence‐silent but can provide greater free volume for monomer diffusion and thus facilitate the patterning of refractive index modulated holograms via photopolymerization‐induced phase separation. The dense crosslinking at stage‐2 can turn on phosphorescence with the intensity rising by 144% when the crosslinking density increases from 3.77 to 4.12 mol L−1. The enhanced phosphorescence is primarily ascribed to the increase of conformational distortion and spin‐orbit coupling of organic phosphors based on theoretical calculations. Eventually, the first example is demonstrated of holographic plastic with the unique capability of independently displaying holographic andphosphorescent images. This work not only provides a novel paradigm to impart added optical functions to ORTP polymer materials but also paves the way for the development of high‐security optical materials to combat counterfeiting.

Herein, an effective strategy is proposed to efficiently harvest waste heat by Zn‐ion battery under thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles. A record high temperature coefficient of 2.944 mV K−1 is obtained, leading to the high relative Carnot efficiency of 26.08% and energy efficiency of 104.11% when the battery is charged at 50 °C and discharged at 5 °C.








Abstract
Typical technologies that can convert waste heat into electricity include thermoelectrics, thermionic capacitors, thermo‐cells, thermal charge cells, and thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles. They have small thermal‐to‐electrical conversion efficiency or poor stability, severely hindering the efficient recovery of waste heat. Herein, a thermally regenerative electrochemical Zn‐ion battery to work under Carnot‐like mode to efficiently harvest waste heat into electricity is successfully developed. Through introducing Layered Double Hydroxides to modify the battery's anode reaction, a record absolute high temperature coefficient of 2.944 mV K−1 is achieved in NiHCF/Zn battery, leading to a high thermal‐to‐electrical conversion efficiency of 26.08% of the Carnot efficiency and an extraordinary energy efficiency of 104.11% when the battery is charged at 50 °C and discharged at 5 °C. This work demonstrates that thermally regenerative electrochemical batteries can effectively harvest waste heat to provide a powerful energy conversion technology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents an innovative solid additive approach to enhance J‐aggregation and exciton delocalization in NIR‐OPDs, improving their sensitivity and specific detectivity across 695–860 nm, advancing self‐powered organic photodetection applications.








Abstract
Near‐infrared organic photodetectors (NIR‐OPDs) have emerged as increasingly significant in optoelectronics, offering unparalleled advantages for applications in health monitoring and night vision. The development of self‐powered devices with low dark currents and enhanced NIR sensitivity involves complex engineering that requires careful material selection, defect state density control, and environmental consideration. In this study, an innovative approach is introduced that utilizes solid additive (DIB) to induce improvements in the J‐aggregation morphology and exciton delocalization in acceptor molecules. The goal is to broaden the response spectrum of the device and augment its detection capabilities. The key findings revealed that solid additive exhibit an electrostatic affinity for acceptors, which facilitates their orderly face‐to‐face stacking and controls the π–π stacking distance. These enhanced intermolecular interactions lead to the delocalization of electron–hole pairs, reduced exciton recombination, and increased charge separation efficiency. Consequently, the modified devices exhibited exceptional specific detectivity, exceeding 1014 Jones across the wavelength range of 695–860 nm, thereby establishing a new standard for NIR response in organic photodetection. Overall, this study successfully addressed the compatibility challenges associated with self‐powered NIR‐OPDs, thereby expanding their potential applications in various settings.

<title>Revealing the Coordination and Mediation Mechanism of Arylboronic Acids Toward Energy‐Dense Li‐S Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Arylboronic acids are explored for use in the electrolyte engineering of Li─S batteries. The theoretically and experimentally verified coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids can not only stabilize the anode interface but also accelerate the sluggish sulfur conversion. 3,5‐bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) is chosen as a suitable electrolyte modifier, significantly improving the electrochemical performance of Li─S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium‐sulfur (Li─S) batteries offer a promising avenue for the next generation of energy‐dense batteries. However, it is quite challenging to realize practical Li─S batteries under limited electrolytes and high sulfur loading, which may exacerbate problems of interface deterioration and low sulfur utilization. Herein, the coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids that enable energy‐dense and long‐term‐cycling Li─S batteries is proposed. The coordination chemistry between NO3− and arylboronic acids breaks the resonance configuration of NO3− and thermodynamically promotes its reduction on the anode, contributing to a mechanically robust interface. The mediation chemistry between lithium arylborate and polysulfides distorts S─S/Li─S bonds, alters the rate‐determining step from Li2S4→Li2S2 to Li2S6→Li2S4, and homogeneously accelerates the sulfur redox kinetics. Li─S batteries using 3,5‐bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) show excellent cycling stability (1000 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.033% per cycle) and a high energy density of 422 Wh kg−1 under aggressive chemical environments (high sulfur loading of 17.4 mg cm−2 and lean electrolyte operation of 3.6 mL gS−1). The basic mechanism of coordination and mediation chemistry can be extended to other arylboronic acids with different configurations and compositions, thus broadening the application prospect of arylboronic acids in the electrolyte engineering of Li─S batteries.

Abstract
Organohydrogels have significant applications in numerous fields. The current synthetic strategies generally rely on the intricate and complex design of lipophilic or hydrophilic polymers to achieve the goal of oil‐water interpenetration. Herein, sub‐nanowires organohydrogels with a dual‐phase structure are fabricated by simply mixing hydroxyapatite sub‐nanowires with organic solvent and aqueous phase. The sub‐nanowires in the oil phase provide structural support, while surfactants in the sub‐nanowires exist at the interface between oil and water, thus forming the water‐in‐oil structure. The organohydrogels possess commendable mechanical properties, an inherent self‐healing ability, and a specific temperature‐responsive behavior. Moreover, the organohydrogels are compatible with a variety of organic solvents and polymers, reserving the promise for wide‐range applications in the future.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of flexible organic solar cells. Herein, a fine‐grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small‐molecule acceptor films, thereby suppressing the non‐ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual‐enriched state. Thus, these provide the potential for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of robust and flexible organic solar cells (F‐OSCs), which are always influenced by mechanical strain and thermodynamic relaxation within the films. Nevertheless, the potential determinants of these properties and quantitative metrics modulating the overall performance of flexible devices have not been thoroughly defined. Herein, a fine‐grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small‐molecule acceptor films, the secondary thermal relaxation of side chains in polyethylene oxide (PEO) local motion restricts the free fluctuation volume through hydrogen‐bonding interactions, thereby suppressing the non‐ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual‐enriched state. These contribute to an increase in yield strength and a reduction in microcracks while enhancing the fracture energy at the donor/acceptor interface. Finally, the optimal F‐OSCs demonstrate champion PCEs of 19.12% (0.04 cm2) and 16.92% (1.00 cm2), and maintain 80% of their initial efficiency after heating at 85 °C for 2600 h. Besides, the flexibility and mechanical robustness of devices are also optimized, the elastic modulus and stiffness are decreased by 50.68% and 5.71%. This work provides interesting references for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in flexible organic photovoltaics.

Interfacial adsorption layers based on N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) are constructed to inhibit Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle by employing an electrolyte additive strategy. These layers stabilize Zn anode via creating a “H2O‐deficient” inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and buffering the interfacial pH, while hindering polyiodide migration at the I2 cathode through ion–dipole interactions. Attributing to these benefits, a long‐lasting aqueous Zn–I2 battery is realized.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc–iodine (Zn–I2) batteries are promising candidates for large‐scale energy storage due to the merits of low cost and high safety. However, their commercial application is hindered by Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle at I2 cathode. Herein, N,N‐bis(2‐hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) based interfacial adsorption layers are constructed to stabilize Zn anodes and mitigate polyiodide shuttle according to ion–dipole interactions, by using a strategy of electrolyte additive. The tertiary amine (N(CH2)3) and carboxyl (─COO−) groups in the deprotonated BHEG can reversibly capture H+ and dynamically neutralize OH− ions, efficiently buffering the interfacial pH of Zn metal anodes and suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions. Additionally, the BHEG adsorption layers can repel 39.3% of H2O molecules at the Zn interface, creating a “water‐deficient” inner Helmholtz plane and preventing Zn corrosion. Significantly, the N(CH2)3 groups in BHEG also inhibit polyiodide shuttle at the I2 cathode, which exhibits high adsorption energies of −0.88, −0.41, and −0.39 eV for I−, I2, and I3−, respectively. Attributing to these benefits, the Zn–I2 battery can achieve a high areal capacity of 2.99 mAh cm−2 and an extended cycling life of 2,000 cycles, even at a high mass loading of I2 cathode (≈21.5 mg cm−2).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Responsive molecules are essential for organic in‐sensor computing devices. This Review highlights recent advances in thedesign, synthesis, and incorporation of electrically, optically, and magnetically responsive molecules in multifunctional synaptic perception devices endowedwith both nonvolatile and volatile memory diversification. By exploiting the multifunctional nature of molecular switches, complex logic operations can be accomplished, bringing molecule‐based neuromorphic computing closer to become a real technology.








Abstract
In the brain, both the recording and decaying of memory information following external stimulus spikes are fundamental learning rules that determine human behaviors. The former is essential to acquire new knowledge and update the database, while the latter filters noise and autorefresh cache data to reduce energy consumption. To execute these functions, the brain relies on different neuromorphic transmitters possessing various memory kinetics, which can be classified as nonvolatile and volatile memory. Inspired by the human brain, nonvolatile and volatile memory electronic devices have been employed to realize artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks, respectively, which have emerged as essential tools in machine learning. Molecular switches, capable of responding to electrical, optical, electrochemical, and magnetic stimuli, display a disruptive potential for emulating information storage in memory devices. This Review highlights recent developments on responsive molecules, their interfacing with low‐dimensional nanostructures and nanomaterials, and their integration into electronic devices. By capitalizing on these concepts, a unique account of neurotransmitter‐transfer electronic devices based on responsive molecules with ad hoc memory kinetics is provided. Finally, future directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed on the use of these devices to engineer more complex logic operations and computing functions at the hardware level.

This study introduces a novel programmable encryption strategy with controllable DNA synthesis and sequential encoding. The proposed hairpin‐mediated primer exchange reaction (HAMER) system enables the dynamic generation of DNA sequences and the secure recording of information with user‐specific access. This approach enhances data security, positioning DNA as a high‐performance material to meet future confidentiality, integrity, and availability demands.









Abstract
DNA molecules, with highly variable sequences and inherent programmability, emerge as a promising material for next‐generation information storage and data encryption. However, due to the singular encryption method or limited randomness of the secret key, current encryptions remain vulnerable to brute‐force attacks and the need for enhanced information security persists. This study introduces a programmable encryption strategy based on long‐chain DNA synthesis and sequential encoding. The proposed hairpin‐mediated primer exchange reaction (HAMER) system enables the generation of DNA keys and the recording of encoded information. Ultimately, encrypted text and image data can be decoded and retrieved through sequencing with customized access based on user permissions. This approach positions DNA as a high‐performance information material and establishes a programmable encryption framework, offering strong potential to meet the confidentiality, integrity, and availability demands of future information security systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A fully synthetic active liquid crystal, energized by an acoustic field, is presented. This system exhibits active nematic behavior, tunable topological defect dynamics, and persistent hydrodynamic vortices at high activity levels. The material maintains stable properties while enabling precise activity control in a wide range.








Abstract
Active nematic materials combine orientational order with activity at the microscopic level. Current experimental realizations of active nematics include vibrating elongated particles, cell layers, suspensions of elongated bacteria, and a mixture of bio‐filaments with molecular motors. The majority of active nematics are of biological origin. The realization of a fully synthetic active liquid crystal comprised of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal energized by ultrasonic waves, is reported. This synthetic active liquid crystal is free from biological degradation and variability, exhibits phenomenology associated with active nematics, and enables precise and rapid activity control over a significantly extended range. It is demonstrated that the energy of the acoustic field is converted into microscopic extensile stresses disrupting long‐range nematic order and giving rise to an undulation instability and proliferation of topological defects. The emergence of unconventional free‐standing persistent vortices in the nematic director field at high activity levels is revealed. The results provide a foundation for the design of externally energized active liquid crystals with stable material properties and tunable topological defect dynamics crucial for the realization of reconfigurable microfluidic systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Implantable devices rely on batteries that demand surgical replacement, posing risks, and financial burdens. Ultrasound energy transfer (US‐ET) offers a revolutionary wireless alternative but struggles with efficiency. The presented dielectric‐ferroelectric‐boosted US‐TENG (US‐TENGDF‐B) is thin, flexible, and biocompatible that provides high‐efficiency and stable power delivery in curved positions, fostering a future of noninvasive and sustainable wireless energy transfer solutions for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Wireless powering of rechargeable‐implantable medical devices presents a challenge in developing reliable wireless energy transfer systems that meet medical safety and standards. Ultrasound‐driven triboelectric nanogenerators (US‐TENG) are investigated for various medical applications, including noninvasive percutaneous wireless battery powering to reduce the need for multiple surgeries for battery replacement. However, these devices often suffer from inefficiency due to limited output performance and rigidity. To address this issue, a dielectric‐ferroelectric boosted US‐TENG (US‐TENGDF‐B) capable of producing a high output charge with low‐intensity ultrasound and a long probe distance is developed, comparatively. The feasibility and output stability of this deformable and augmented device is confirmed under various bending conditions, making it suitable for use in the body's curved positions or with electronic implants. The device achieved an output of ≈26 V and ≈6.7 mW output for remote charging of a rechargeable battery at a 35 mm distance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the output‐augmented US‐TENG for deep short‐term wireless charging of implantable electronics with flexing conditions in curved devices such as future total artificial hearts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI‐LMS) inspired by the biomechanical properties of human fingertips. The AI‐LMS demonstrates superior performance in multidimensional pressure sensing, characterized by high linearity and stability. Potential applications encompass enhancing robotic tactile perception and facilitating precise 3D surface scanning, representing a significant milestone in the field of soft robotics technology.








Abstract
The advancement of robotic behavior and intelligence has led to an urgent demand for improving their sensitivity and interactive capabilities, which presents challenges in achieving multidimensional, wide‐ranging, and reliable tactile sensing. Here an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI‐LMS) is introduced inspired by the human fingertip, which inherently possesses the capability to detect spatially multi‐axis pressure with a wide sensing range, exceptional linearity, and signal stability. Additionally, it can detect very small pressures and responds swiftly to prescribed forces. Compared to resistive signals, inductive signals offer significant advantages. Further, integrated with a deep neural network model, the AI‐LMS can decouple multi‐axis pressures acting simultaneously upon it. Notably, the sensing range of Ecoflex and PDMS‐based AI‐LMS can be expanded by a factor of 4 and 9.5, respectively. For practical illustrations, a high‐precision surface scanning reconstruction system is developed capable of capturing intricate details of 3D surface profiles. The utilization of biomimetic AI‐LMS as robotic fingertips enables real‐time discrimination of diverse delicate grasping behaviors across different fingers. The innovations and unique features in sensing mechanisms and structural design are expected to bring transformative changes and find extensive applications in the field of soft robotics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study investigates the effects of nanoplastics on human immune cells using palladium‐doped polystyrene nanoplastics and mass cytometry. It reveals that nanoplastics accumulate in various immune cell subpopulations, reducing cell viability and impairing function. In vivo experiments in mice confirm their accumulation in several immune cells. This accumulation poses health risks, highlighting the potential dangers of nanoplastics to human health.








Abstract
The increasing exposure to nanoplastics (NPs) raises significant concerns for human health, primarily due to their potential bioaccumulative properties. While NPs have recently been detected in human blood, their interactions with specific immune cell subtypes and their impact on immune regulation remain unclear. In this proof‐of‐concept study, model palladium‐doped polystyrene NPs (PS‐Pd NPs) are utilized to enable single‐cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) detection. The size‐dependent impact of carboxylate polystyrene NPs (50–200 nm) is investigated across 15 primary immune cell subpopulations using CyTOF. By taking advantage of Pd‐doping for detecting PS‐Pd NPs, this work evaluates their impact on human immune‐cells at the single‐cell level following blood exposure. This work traces PS‐Pd NPs in 37 primary immune‐cell subpopulations from human blood, quantifying the palladium atom count per cell by CyTOF while simultaneously assessing the impact of PS‐Pd NPs on cell viability, functionality, and uptake. These results demonstrate that NPs can interact with, interfere with, and translocate into several immune cell subpopulations after exposure. In vivo distribution experiments in mice further confirmed their accumulation in immune cells within the liver, blood, and spleen, particularly in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. These findings provide valuable insights into the impact of NPs on human health.

First, the underlying mechanisms of tribovoltaic effect at the interface are elaborated, as well as some governing equations and key interface design concepts. Subsequently, diverse strategies for advanced interface design are highlighted, including modulating interfacial charge dynamics, multi‐energy coupling, reducing interface wear loss, and extending flexible/wearable application. At last, some assumptions about the future direction and prospects of advanced interface design in efficient, multifunctional TVNGs are presented.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This paper presents a comprehensive review of the synergistic integration of halide perovskite and rare‐earth ions toward photonics including structural features, optical properties, preparation methods, and photonic applications. Critical challenges and perspectives are introduced. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for perovskite and rare‐earth composites and their intriguing future application scenario.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs), emerging as a noteworthy class of semiconductors, hold great promise for an array of optoelectronic applications, including anti‐counterfeiting, light‐emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and photodetectors, primarily due to their large absorption cross section, high fluorescence efficiency, tunable emission spectrum within the visible region, and high tolerance for lattice defects, as well as their adaptability for solution‐based fabrication processes. Unlike luminescent HPs with band‐edge emission, trivalent rare‐earth (RE) ions typically emit low‐energy light through intra‐4f optical transitions, characterized by narrow emission spectra and long emission lifetimes. When fused, the cooperative interactions between HPs and REs endow the resulting binary composites not only with optoelectronic properties inherited from their parent materials but also introduce new attributes unattainable by either component alone. This review begins with the fundamental optoelectronic characteristics of HPs and REs, followed by a particular focus on the impact of REs on the electronic structures of HPs and the associated energy transfer processes. The advanced synthesis methods utilized to prepare HPs, RE‐doped compounds, and their binary composites are overviewed. Furthermore, potential applications are summarized across diverse domains, including high‐fidelity anticounterfeiting, bioimaging, LEDs, photovoltaics, photodetection, and photocatalysis, and conclude with remaining challenges and future research prospects.

This review summarizes recent advancements in the interface engineering of 2DMs for high‐temperature electronic devices. Initially, the limitations of conventional silicon‐based materials and WBG semiconductors, alongside the advantages offered by 2DMs, are examined. Subsequently, strategies for interface engineering to enhance the stability of 2DMs and the performance of their devices are detailed. Furthermore, various interface‐engineered 2D high‐temperature devices, including transistors, optoelectronic devices, sensors, memristors, and neuromorphic devices, are reviewed. Finally, a forward‐looking perspective on future 2D high‐temperature electronics is presented. This review offers valuable insights into emerging 2DMs and their applications in high‐temperature environments from both fundamental and practical perspectives.

<title>Ultrafast Charge Transfer on Ru‐Cu Atomic Units for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2O2 Production</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
[Ru(bpy)2]2+ photosensitive components are integrated into the Cu‐HHTP MOF, coordinating with the Cu‐O4 sites to assemble a bi‐functional unit, thereby facilitating efficient local electron migration. Compared to the dissociative photosensitizer system, this newly constructed configuration exhibits a significant increase in the efficiency of photoinduced charge carrier transfer, resulting in a 37.2‐fold enhancement in the photosynthesis of H2O2.








Abstract
Photosensitizer‐assisted photocatalytic systems offer a solution to overcome the limitations of inherent light harvesting capabilities in catalysts. However, achieving efficient charge transfer between the dissociative photosensitizer and catalyst poses a significant challenge. Incorporating photosensitive components into reactive centers to establish well‐defined charge transfer channels is expected to effectively address this issue. Herein, the electrostatic‐driven self‐assembly method is utilized to integrate photosensitizers into metal–organic frameworks, constructing atomically Ru‐Cu bi‐functional units to promote efficient local electron migration. Within this newly constructed system, the [Ru(bpy)2]2+ component and Cu site serve as photosensitive and catalytic active centers for photocarrier generation and H2O2 production, respectively, and their integration significantly reduces the barriers to charge transfer. Ultrafast spectroscopy and in situ characterization unveil accelerated directional charge transfer over Ru‐Cu units, presenting orders of magnitude improvement over dissociative photosensitizer systems. As a result, a 37.2‐fold enhancement of the H2O2 generation rate (570.9 µmol g−1 h−1) over that of dissociative photosensitizer system (15.3 µmol g−1 h−1) is achieved. This work presents a promising strategy for integrating atomic‐scale photosensitive and catalytic active centers to achieve ultrafast photocarrier transfer and enhanced photocatalytic performance.

The functionalized acellular mushroom scaffold promotes the healing of infectious bone defects through 1) controlling bacterial infections through Zn2+/curcumin MOFs; 2) rapid cell recruitment induced by its naturally aligned channels; 3) immune regulation and osteogenic differentiation by icariin.








Abstract
Infected bone defects are a common clinical condition, but conventional treatments often fail to achieve the desired outcomes, including addressing antibiotic resistance and preventing nonunion complications. In the presented study, a functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold is developed composed of its naturally aligned channels, Zn2+/curcumin MOFs, hydroxyapatite minerals, and icariin. In vitro, It is found that functionalized acellular mushroom stem scaffold can control bacterial infections through Zn2+/curcumin MOFs. The naturally aligned channels guide bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) migration, and the components adsorbed on the acellular substrate further promote the migration of BMSCs. Moreover, these functional components further accelerated the polarization of M2 macrophage and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. In vivo, the functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold cleared infected bacteria within 3 days, induced extracellular matrix secretion and alignment, and promoted new bone formation to cover defects within 8 weeks. The functionalized decellularized mushroom stem scaffold provides a promising strategy for treating infectious bone defects.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Biological systems are very responsive to changes in stiffness, influencing important processes, and diseases in humans. Here, a novel method to dynamically and reversibly control hydrogel stiffness through interactions with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is presented. By exposing hydrogels to PEG solutions at different concentrations and sizes, hydrogel stiffness can be tuned, in turn affecting cell properties.








Abstract
Cells are highly responsive to changes in their mechanical environment, influencing processes such as stem cell differentiation and tumor progression. To meet the growing demand for materials used for high throughput mechanotransduction studies, simple means of dynamically adjusting the environmental viscoelasticity of cell cultures are needed. Here, a novel method is presented to dynamically and reversibly control the viscoelasticity of naturally derived polymer hydrogels through interactions with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG). Interactions between PEG and hydrogel polymers, possibly involving hydrogen bonding, stiffen the hydrogel matrices. By dynamically changing the PEG concentration of the solution in which polymer hydrogels are incubated, their viscoelastic properties are adjusted, which in turn affects cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Importantly, this effects is reversible, providing a cost‐effective and simple strategy for dynamically adjusting the viscoelasticity of polymer hydrogels. This method holds promise for applications in mechanobiology, biomedicine, and the life sciences.

<title>Electrochemically Driven Optical Dynamics of Reflectin Protein Films</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The use of electrochemical correlative ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to trigger, control, and observe changes in the optical properties of reflectin protein films is demonstrated. Voltage‐regulated charge neutralization allows tunable, reversible, and cyclic control of the water volume fraction in the reflectin film, thereby influencing its optical characteristics.








Abstract
Neuronally triggered phosphorylation drives the dynamic condensation of reflectin proteins, enabling squid to fine tune the colors reflected from specialized skin cells (iridocytes) for camouflage and communication. Reflectin, the primary component of iridocyte lamellae, forms alternating layers of protein and low refractive index extracellular space within membrane‐encapsulated structures, acting as a biologically tunable distributed Bragg reflector. In vivo, reflectin condensation induces osmotic dehydration of these lamellae, reducing their thickness and shifting the wavelength of reflected light. Inspired by this natural mechanism, we demonstrate that electrochemical reduction of imidazolium moieties within the protein provides a reversible and tunable method to control the water volume fraction in reflectin thin films, allowing precise, dynamic modulation of the film’s refractive index and thickness — mimicking the squid’s dynamic color adaptation. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we developed electrochemical correlative ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy, enabling real‐time analysis of optical property changes of reflectin films. This electrochemically driven approach offers unprecedented control over reflectin condensation dynamics. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of biophysical processes governing cephalopod coloration but also pave the way for bio‐inspired materials and devices that seamlessly integrate biological principles with synthetic systems to bridge the biotic‐abiotic gap.

This article presents a non‐destructive molecular encoding approach using hierarchical array of functionalized graphene‐based sensors for spatiotemporal analysis of volatile signaling molecules. Combined with deep learning, this method enables real‐time imaging and genetic profiling of organoids, deciphering molecular production pathways through specific enzymes and metabolic routes and advancing precision diagnostics and personalized medicine without harmful staining or sample destruction.








Abstract
Organoids mimic human organ function, offering insights into development and disease. However, non‐destructive, real‐time monitoring is lacking, as traditional methods are often costly, destructive, and low‐throughput. In this article, a non‐destructive chemical tomographic strategy is presented for decoding cyto‐proteo‐genomics of organoid using volatile signaling molecules, hereby, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), to indicate metabolic activity and development of organoids. Combining a hierarchical design of graphene‐based sensor arrays with AI‐driven analysis, this method maps VOC spatiotemporal distribution and generate detailed digital profiles of organoid morphology and proteo‐genomic features. Lens‐ and label‐free, it avoids phototoxicity, distortion, and environmental disruption. Results from testing organoids with the reported chemical tomography approach demonstrate effective differentiation between cyto‐proteo‐genomic profiles of normal and diseased states, particularly during dynamic transitions such as epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, the reported approach identifies key VOC‐related biochemical pathways, metabolic markers, and pathways associated with cancerous transformations such as aromatic acid degradation and lipid metabolism. This real‐time, non‐destructive approach captures subtle genetic and structural variations with high sensitivity and specificity, providing a robust platform for multi‐omics integration and advancing cancer biomarker discovery.

A dead APC‐4T1‐N3‐LipoH (DPNL) is constructed via clicking reprogrammed APC like‐4T1 cells with liposome encapsulating HMME (LHs). Sonosensitive DPNL cells effectively target tumor sites and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Upon ultrasound, DPNL cells could co‐stimulate the antigen‐presenting program and strikingly elicit antigen‐specific T cell‐mediated adaptive immunity in TDLNs as well as MHC‐I unrestricted NK cell‐mediated innate immunity within tumors for comprehensive sonoimmunotherapy for triple negative breast cancers.








Abstract
Ultrasound therapy has turned up as a noninvasive multifunctional tool for cancer immunotherapy. However, the insufficient co‐stimulating molecules and loss of peptide‐major histocompatibility complex I (MHC‐I) expression on tumor cells lead to poor therapy of sonoimmunotherapies. Herein, this work develops a sonosensitive system to augment MHC‐I unrestricted natural killer (NK) cell‐mediated innate immunity and T cell‐mediated adaptive immunity by leveraging antigen presentation cell (APC)‐like tumor cells. Genetically engineered tumor cells featuring sufficient co‐stimulating molecules are cryo‐shocked and conjugated with a sonosensitizer, hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether, using click chemistry. These cells (DPNLs) exhibit characteristics of tumor and draining lymph node homing. Under ultrasound, NK cell‐mediated innate immunity within the tumor microenvironment could be activated, and T cells in the tumor‐draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are stimulated through co‐stimulatory molecules. In combination with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) antibody, DPNLs extend the survival time and inhibited lung metastasis in triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. This study provides an alternative approach for sonoimmunotherapy with precise sonosensitizer delivery and enhanced NK cell and T cell activation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this report, the internal strain affecting the stability of FAPbI3 perovskite is addressed through the design of additives in the precursor solution. Instead of conventional methylammonium chloride, a triple‐additive approach is employed, leading to improved phase stability and reduced strain gradient. The strategy results in enhanced durability and efficiency, with power conversion efficiency retention of 95% after 8000 h under the ISOS‐D‐1 condition and a maximum PCE of 24.50%.








Abstract
The stability of the FAPbI3 perovskite phase is significantly affected by internal strain. In this report, additives in the perovskite precursor solution are designed to prevent local lattice mismatch of the resulting perovskite layer. Instead of using a conventional methylammonium chloride (Control), triple additives (Target) are introduced by considering ion association and formation energy. The out‐of‐plane orientation for the (100) plane is less pronounced by the triple additives compared to the Control film with a highly enhanced preferred orientation, which reduces the strain gradient and the Pb─I bond distance. Moreover, the anisotropic atomic‐level lattice strain along (111) plane, associated with the α‐to‐δ phase transition, is more uniformly distributed by the triple additives. The triple‐additive strategy demonstrates exceptional phase stability under relative humidity as high as 90% and the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS)‐L‐2 protocol. The device lifetime measured under the ISOS‐D‐1 condition shows that the Target perovskite solar cell (PSC) maintains 95% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for over 8000 h, and the best PCE of 24.50% is achieved.

A novel Ga2O3 solar‐blind photodetector with a vertically stratified crystalline structure and VO concentration is designed to spatially separate the carrier's generation and transport channels in the device, thus achieving excellent responsivity and response speed simultaneously.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) emerges as a promising solar‐blind photodetector (SBPD) material if the “Response Speed (RS) dilemma” can be resolved. Devices with spatially segregated carrier generation and transport channels offer a potential solution but remain less available. This work introduces a novel thermal pulse treatment (TPT) method to achieve a vertically stratified crystalline structure and oxygen vacancies (VO) throughout the Ga2O3 film, validated through extensive characterizations. Technology Computer‐Aided Design (TCAD) simulations corroborated the critical role of VO stratification in enhancing the responsivity (Rλ) and response speed simultaneously. Consequently, the TPT‐processed SBPD exhibited exceptional performance, boasting a maximum  Rλ of 312.6 A W−1 and a faster decay time of 40 µs, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding SBPD chips show significant potential for applications in solar‐blind imaging, light trajectory tracking, and solar‐blind power meters. This work thus provides a viable strategy to address the “RS dilemma” common in most wide‐bandgap materials, showcasing excellent application value.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Escherichia coli wall‐derived carbon dots (E‐CDs) competitively bind to lipopolysaccharide‐binding protein, promoting Toll‐like receptor 4 degradation via the lysosomal pathway and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa‐B activation activation. Additionally, E‐CDs reduce oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA release, thereby suppressing overactivation of the stimulator of interferon gene pathway. This study highlights the potential of E‐CDs to suppress cytokine storms, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for sepsis.








Abstract
Sepsis is a life‐threatening disease caused by a dysregulated immune response to infection, often involving the translocation of Gram‐negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) into the bloodstream, triggering a cytokine storm. Despite its severity, no effective drugs currently exist for sepsis treatment. This study explores whether pathogen‐derived carbon dots can mitigate their inherent toxicity while leveraging their structural similarity to pathogens to competitively bind pattern recognition receptors, thereby inhibiting sepsis. Based on this concept, E. coli wall‐derived carbon dots (E‐CDs) are synthesized and shown to reduce inflammatory cytokine production, protect organ function, and improve survival in septic mice. Mechanistic studies reveal that E‐CDs competitively bind to lipopolysaccharide‐binding protein with lipopolysaccharide, promoting toll‐like receptor 4 degradation via the lysosomal pathway and inhibiting nuclear factor kappa‐B (NF‐κB) activation. Additionally, E‐CDs exhibit antioxidant properties, reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial DNA release, thereby suppressing overactivation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. In septic cynomolgus monkeys and patient‐derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells, E‐CDs alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress. Overall, this study demonstrates that E‐CDs can suppress the cytokine storm in sepsis by co‐silencing innate immune pathways, suggesting that converting pathogens into carbon dots offers a novel therapeutic strategy.

<title>Mechanically Compatible Sealing of Hydrogel with Coherent Interface</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A mechanically compatible seal is proposed for preventing hydrogels from water loss and swelling. This seal is made of a carbon‐based elastomer blended with oligomers for controlling modulus and with polar polymeric domains for forming coherent interfaces, resulting in orders of magnitude improvements in the longevity of hydrogels without sacrificing their softness and stretchability.








Abstract
Long‐term operation of hydrogels relies on protective coatings to avoid water swelling or evaporation, but these protections often cause substantial decreases in overall softness and stretchability. Here, a mechanically compatible seal with a coherent interfacial design is developed to encapsulate hydrogels. This seal is made from polybutylene (PIB) and polypropylene‐graft‐maleic anhydride (PP‐g‐MAH) blended poly(styrene‐isobutylene‐styrene) (SIBS). The PIB oligomers soften the SIBS networks, while the MAH groups facilitate covalent bonding between the SIBS and hydrogel. The sealed hydrogel exhibits an elastic modulus of 24 kPa and an elongation at a break of >1000%, both comparable to those of the pristine hydrogel. The adhesion energy between the seal and hydrogel reached >140 J m−2 and can be further increased to >400 J m−2 by a thermal treatment. This tough interface, together with the intrinsically low water vapor transmission rate of SIBS, allows the sealed hydrogel to maintain its modulus and stretchability after 10 days of drying in air. The sealed hydrogel is chemically and mechanically stable under harsh conditions, including acidic/alkaline/salty solutions, high temperatures, and cyclic mechanical deformation. This strategy applies to various hydrogels with diverse compositions and structures, leading to orders of magnitude improvements in the longevity of hydrogel‐based electronic devices.

<title>Electrically Switchable Multi‐Stable Topological States Enabled by Surface‐Induced Frustration in Nematic Liquid Crystal Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In a liquid crystal (LC) cell with well‐designed surface anchoring patterns, electrical switching between multi‐stable states with distinct optical properties is obtained. Dual‐frequency LC with frequency dependent dielectric properties is used to realize repeatable switching between different topological states with and without disclination lines. Metastability without the need for an applied voltage is demonstrated.








Abstract
In liquid crystal (LC) cells, the surface patterning directs the self‐assembly of the uniaxial building blocks in the bulk, enabling the design of stimuli‐response optical devices with various functionalities. The combination of different anchoring patterns at both substrates can lead to surface induced frustration, preventing a purely planar and defect‐free configuration. In cells with crossed assembly of rotating anchoring patterns, elastic deformations allow to obtain a defect‐free bulk configuration, but an electrical stimulus can induce disclination lines. The disclination network is preserved without applied voltage. Depending on the electric field treatment and geometrical parameters, different multi‐stable states with and without disclinations are obtained. This is demonstrated with the help of dual‐frequency LCs, for which the frequency dependent dielectric properties allow repeatable switching between multi‐stable states. Topological protection and the associated energy barrier between different states explains the observed metastability. The obtained configurations are retrieved with Q‐tensor simulations and the validity is confirmed by matching optical simulations with experimentally obtained microscopy images. The realized multi‐stable topological states interact differently with light, resulting in distinct optical properties. Optimization allows to switch between a highly transparent state and an opaque state, opening up opportunities for smart windows with low energy consumption.

Magnetic property measurements reveal that the synthesized 1T‐CrTe2 films exhibit room‐temperature magnetism, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and distinct step‐like magnetic transitions. Moreover, the study highlights how unintentional adsorbents or dopants can significantly influence the magnetic behaviors of such 1T‐CrTe2 films.








Abstract
2D room‐temperature ferromagnet CrTe2 is a promising candidate material for spintronic applications. However, its large‐scale and cost‐effective synthesis remains a challenge. Here, the fine controllable synthesis of wafer‐scale 1T‐CrTe2 films is reported on a SiO2/Si substrate using plasma‐enhanced chemical vapor deposition at temperatures below 400 °C. Magnetic hysteresis measurements reveal that the synthesized 1T‐CrTe2 films exhibit perpendicular magnetic anisotropy along with distinct step‐like magnetic transitions. It is found that 1T‐CrTe2 is susceptible to oxygen adsorption even in ambient conditions. The theoretical calculations indicate that the oxidation of surface layers is crucial for the absence of out‐of‐plane easy axis in few‐layer CrTe2, while the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling among the upper surface layers leads to the observed step‐like magnetic transitions. The study provides a Si‐CMOS compatible approach for the fabrication of magnetic 2D materials and highlights how unintentional adsorbents or dopants can significantly influence the magnetic behaviors of these materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Spin‐dependent optical emission is observed in hexagonal boron nitride across a wide band of wavelengths from the violet to the near‐infrared, and attributed to spin defect pairs. These broadband spin pairs are found to exist naturally in a variety of samples from bulk crystals to powders to epitaxial films, and can be coherently controlled across the entire wavelength range.








Abstract
Optically addressable solid‐state spins are an important platform for practical quantum technologies. Van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a promising host as it contains a wide variety of optical emitters, but thus far observations of addressable spins have been sparse, and most of them lacked a demonstration of coherent spin control. Here, robust optical readout of spin pairs in hBN is demonstrated with emission wavelengths spanning from violet to the near‐infrared. It is found that these broadband spin pairs exist naturally in a variety of hBN samples from bulk crystals to powders to epitaxial films, and can be coherently controlled across the entire wavelength range. Furthermore, the optimal wavelengths are identified for independent readout of spin pairs and boron vacancy spin defects co‐existing in the same sample. These results establish the ubiquity of the optically addressable spin pair system in hBN across a broad parameter space, making it a versatile playground for spin‐based quantum technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) with unprecedented long life and ultrahigh specific capacity are demonstrated through the design of an acceptor‐multi‐F state electrolyte. This electrolyte design endows FIBs with durable reversible fluorination/defluorination reaction (over 3700 cycles), a high‐output voltage of CuF2//Li configuration (with a discharge plateau of 2.9 V), and larger‐sized pouch‐type CuF2//Sn+SnF2 configuration (with a reversible capacity of 530 mAh g−1).








Abstract
Fluoride ion batteries (FIBs) have garnered significant attention due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density, dendrite‐free safety, and resource abundance. Although some anion acceptors have been proposed to address the insolubility of inorganic fluoride salts, the difficulty in dissociating fluoride ions from acceptors results in short lifespan and extremely low specific capacity of FIBs. Here, a fluoride ion battery is demonstrated with unprecedented long life and ultrahigh specific capacity through the design of an acceptor‐multi‐F state electrolyte. The high Lewis acidity of triphenylantimony chloride (TSbCl) as a novel anion acceptor in electrolyte facilitates the complete dissociation of CsF, and the resulting TSbCl‐F complex can further interact with fluoride ions to form the acceptor‐multi‐F states. This strategy combines the high dissociation capability for fluoride salts with the minimal thermodynamic barriers for releasing fluoride ions at electrode‐electrolyte interface. This electrolyte design endows FIBs with durable reversible fluorination/defluorination reaction (3700 cycles with high coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and small voltage polarization of 30 mV) and ultrahigh reversible capacity (580 mAh g−1 after 40 cycles at 100 mA g−1). The high‐output voltage FIBs of CuF2//Li configuration (with discharge plateau of 2.9 V) and larger‐sized pouch‐type FIBs of CuF2//Sn+SnF2 configuration (with reversible capacity of 530 mAh g−1) are demonstrated.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, an intermolecular‐reinforced ether‐based electrolyte is presented to well stabilize the aggressive NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.2 VNa. With this electrolyte, a high‐voltage aAhmpere‐hour‐level pouch cell based on the cathode and hard carbon anode shows excellent long‐term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles.








Abstract
To fulfill the requirements for practical applications, it is urgent to boost the gravimetric energy density of sodium‐ion batteries. An effective way is to increase the charging voltage of O3‐type layered cathodes preferably to 4.2 V versus Na/Na+ (VNa). Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to achieve stable cycling of the cathodes at such a high cut‐off voltage. Here a novel electrolyte strategy to design an intermolecular‐reinforced electrolyte (IRE) is presented, utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, which facilitates stable high‐voltage cycling of the commercially viable NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM). While the NFM with the IRE exhibits a high specific capacity of ≈158 mAh g−1 at 4.2 VNa (130 mAh g−1 at 4.0 VNa), the aggressive cathode surface can still be effectively stabilized by the formation of favorable thin and inorganic‐rich cathode−electrolyte interfaces. Remarkably, under a high cut‐off voltage of 4.2 VNa, an industrial ampere‐hour‐level NFM||hard carbon pouch cell with the IRE electrolyte shows an excellent long‐term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles, largely outperforming the localized high‐concentration electrolyte (82.9% after 200 cycles).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (e‐NO3RR) shows promise for NH3 synthesis but suffer from insufficient activity. One mechanism is proposed to integrate a proton donor for O‐end e‐NO3RR. Based on that, a model catalyst with Cu single atoms on La‐based nanoparticles is designed, achieving exceptional efficiency and stability. This paves the way for innovative electrocatalyst design in NH3 production and beyond.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is vital in global production and energy cycles. Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (e‐NO3RR) offers a promising route for nitrogen (N) conversion and NH3 synthesis, yet it faces challenges like competing reactions and low catalyst activity. This study proposes a synergistic mechanism incorporating a proton donor to mediate O‐end e‐NO3RR, addressing these limitations. A novel method combining ultraviolet radiation reduction, confined synthesis, and microwave treatment was developed to create a model catalyst embedding Cu single atoms on La‐based nanoparticles (p‐CNCusLan‐m). DFT analysis emphasizes the critical role of La‐based clusters as proton donors in e‐NO3RR, while in situ characterization reveals an O‐end adsorption reduction mechanism. The catalyst achieves a remarkable Faraday efficiency (FENH3) of 97.7%, producing 10.6 mol gmetal−1 h−1 of NH3, surpassing most prior studies. In a flow cell, it demonstrated exceptional stability, with only a 9% decrease in current density after 111 hours and a NH3 production rate of 1.57 mgNH3/h/cm−2. The proton donor mechanism's effectiveness highlights its potential for advancing electrocatalyst design. Beyond NH3 production, the O‐end mechanism opens avenues for exploring molecular‐oriented coupling reactions in e‐NO3RR, paving the way for innovative electrochemical synthesis applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multifunctional “Trojan” molecule based on membrane‐mimicking and zwitterionic conjugated electrolyte is developed for advanced drug delivery systems. By integrating into and rigidifying lipid bilayer structures, it prevents premature payload leakage and enables reliable in vivo visualization of carriers. Upon remote 808 nm excitation, this light‐responsive molecule triggers rapid drug release at tumor sites, inducing synergistic multimodal therapies.








Abstract
Enhancing payload encapsulation stability while enabling controlled drug release are both critical objectives in drug delivery systems but are challenging to reconcile. This study introduces a zwitterionic conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecule named Zwit, which acts as a molecular Trojan by mimicking the lipid bilayers. When integrated into liposome membranes, Zwit rigidifies the bilayer structure likely due to its hydrophobic interactions providing structural support, thus inhibiting drug leakage. Upon 808 nm laser excitation, Zwit rapidly accelerates DOX release from liposome core, likely due to light‐triggered conformational changes or photothermal effects that compromise membrane permeability. These findings demonstrate Zwit’s ability to overcome the challenge of simultaneously preventing premature payload leakage and enabling stimuli‐responsive drug release with a single component. Additionally, Zwit exhibits excellent biocompatibility with membranes, outperforming its quaternary ammonium counterpart and commonly used dye indocyanine green (ICG). By harnessing its NIR‐II emission, Zwit enables durable in vivo biodistribution tracking of nanocarriers, whereas ICG suffers from significant dye leakage. In subcutaneous tumor models, the synergistic effects of chemotherapy and thermotherapy facilitated by this light‐triggered system induced a potent antitumor immune response, further enhancing anticancer efficacy. This work underscores the potential of membrane‐mimicking CEs as multifunctional tools in advanced drug delivery systems.

<title>2D AgTiPS6: a Cross‐Stacked In‐Plane Anisotropic Semiconductor for Broadband and Polarization‐Sensitive Photodetection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
AgTiPS6 atomic layers, the 2D in‐plane anisotropic material with cross‐stacked motifs, are discovered and added to the 2D material family. They feature a thick monolayer, strong stability, and inherent anisotropy. As an in‐plane anisotropic 2D semiconductor, AgTiPS6‐based photodetectors demonstrate excellent photoresponse across a broad range from visible to mid‐infrared, as well as high in‐plane electrical (≈5.44) and optoelectrical (≈2.44) anisotropies. 








Abstract
2D anisotropic materials, typically consisting of 1D distorted chains arranged in parallel or anti‐parallel patterns, are gaining attention for their potential in anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices. 2D anisotropic materials with cross‐stacked interconnected 1D chains will show improved anisotropy and stability. Nonetheless, to date, no 2D anisotropic materials featuring cross‐stacked motifs have been experimentally realized. This work identifies AgTiPS6 atomic layers, the 2D in‐plane anisotropic material with cross‐stacked structural motifs, as an n‐type semiconductor with a 1.0 eV band gap. Significantly, the unique cross‐stacked configuration of 2D AgTiPS6 results in a significant in‐plane anisotropy, with electrical and optoelectrical anisotropies measuring 5.44 and 2.44, respectively, as well as an axially orientation selectivity. Meanwhile, a broadband response from visible (Vis, 405 nm) to middle infrared (MIR, 10.6 µm) is achieved in the AgTiPS6‐based photodetector, with the photoresponse above the bandgap attributed to photothermoelectric effect. Furthermore, 2D AgTiPS6 has demonstrated environmental stability exceeding 12 months and a laser damage threshold exceeding 10 W cm−2, attributed to its extra‐thick monolayer (1.32 nm). This work introduces a novel in‐plane anisotropic material, expanding the repertoire of 2D anisotropic materials and offering potential for the development of anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A fully conjugated 2D hexaimino‐substituted triphenylene‐based metal‐organic framework (2D‐HATP‐cMOF) based composite membrane is reported for nanofluidic photoelectric conversion. Owing to the intrinsic advantage of multiple charge transport pathways, and open framework with nano‐spaced, high‐density pores, the 2D‐HATP‐cMOF‐based composite membrane possesses fast photoelectric response, successful ion pump phenomenon, and efficient photoelectric energy conversion.








Abstract
Nanofluidic photoelectric conversion system based on photo‐excitable 2D materials can directly transduce light stimuli into an ion‐transport‐mediated electric signal, showing potential for mimicking the retina's function with a more favorable human–robot interactions. However, the current membranes suffer from low generation efficiency of charge carriers due to the mixed microstructure and limited charge transport ability caused by the large interlayer spacing and monotonous pathway. Here, a fully conjugated 2D hexaimino‐substituted triphenylene‐based metal–organic framework (2D‐HATP‐cMOF) based composite membrane with high conductivity for photoelectric conversion is presented. The extended π‐d conjugation within the ab plane and the favorable transport pathway through π–π stacking of the c‐MOF maximize the generation and transfer of charge carrier and greatly accelerate the ion transport. As a result, the 2D‐HATP‐cMOF‐based composite membrane possesses ultrafast photoelectric response, superior to other reported 2D systems like graphene oxide (GO), transition metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (MXene), and MoS2, which require at least 10 s. A successful ion pump phenomenon, that is active transport from low concentration to high concentration as an important way of information transmission in organisms, is realized based on the efficient photoelectric conversion capability. This work demonstrates the great promise of 2D c‐MOF in ionic photoelectric conversion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A universal thick anode composed of polymer and carbon nanotubes has been developed, demonstrating stable operation across 15 simple‐ion and 3 complex‐ion systems. It achieves exceptional cycle life in supercapacitors, ultrahigh areal capacities in batteries, and high compatibility with seawater electrolytes. With ultrahigh‐loading capability (100 mg cm⁻2) and cost‐effectiveness, this thick electrode is promising for practical aqueous (seawater) energy devices.









Abstract
Aqueous and seawater energy storage devices hold great potential for electrical grids application due to safety, affordability, and sustainability. However, their broader deployment has been constrained by the absence of a durable thick anode. Here, the first universal thick anode operating stably across 15 simple‐ion and 3 complex‐ion systems, including nonmetallic (H+, NH4
+), monovalent (Li+, Na+, K+), multivalent ions (Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+), and seawater ions (>5 cations) is reported. Composed of polymer nanosheets and carbon nanotubes, this anode supports thick electrode fabrication (e.g., 100 mg cm−2 and 1 mm) with low porosity/tortuosity, superior electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness, and chemical stability. Consequently, it achieves exceptionable cycle life (up to 380 000 cycles) in supercapacitors and ultrahigh areal capacities (6.5 mAh cm−2) in batteries, even under practical/extreme conditions, attributed to the formation of a water‐scarce, cation‐rich electrical double‐layer structure, as revealed by simulations. Compatible with sea salt‐based electrolytes and paired with a metal‐free cathode, the anode enables seawater batteries with thousands‐cycle life and high energy/power density. Of universal ion storage, ultrahigh‐loading capability, unlimited resources, and cost‐effectiveness, this polymer electrode is promising for practical aqueous (seawater) energy devices.

<title>Perturbing Organelle‐Level K+/Ca2+ Homeostasis by Nanotherapeutics for Enhancing Ion‐Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ion‐mediated immunotherapy agent (IMIA) is engineered to achieve precise spatiotemporal control of perturbing K+/Ca2+ homeostasis at the organelle‐level, which can effectively evoke tumor‐associated immunogenicity, thereby stimulating the activation of DCs and potentiating the infiltration of tumor‐specific cytotoxic T cells to achieve high‐performance cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Intracellular ions are involved in numerous pivotal immune processes, but the precise regulation of these signaling ions to achieve innovative immune therapeutic strategies is still a huge challenge. Here, an ion‐mediated immunotherapy agent (IMIA) is engineered to achieve precise spatiotemporal control of perturbing K+/Ca2+ homeostasis at the organelle‐level, thereby amplifying antitumor immune responses to achieve high‐performance cancer therapy. By taking in intracellular K+ and supplying exogenous Ca2+ within tumor cells, K+/Ca2+ homeostasis is perturbed by IMIA. In parallel, perturbing K+ homeostasis induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers the release of Ca2+ from ER and causes a decreased concentration of Ca2+ in ER, which further accelerates ER‐mitochondria Ca2+ flux and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (store‐operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE)) via opening Ca2+ release‐activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, thus creating a self‐amplifying ion interference loop to perturb K+/Ca2+ homeostasis. In this process, the elevated immunogenicity of tumor cells would evoke robust antitumor immune responses by driving the excretion of damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Importantly, this ion‐immunotherapy strategy reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and awakens the systemic immune response and long‐term immune memory effect, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of primary/distant tumors, orthotopic tumors as well as metastatic tumors in different mice models.

<title>Alkaline Adjuvant Regulates Proteolytic Activity of Macrophages for Antigen Cross‐Presentation and Potentiates Radioimmunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tissue‐repairing macrophages compromise radiotherapy‐induced antitumor immunity. An alkaline adjuvant (MgAl‐based hydrotalcite, bLDH) reverses the situation. After engendering macrophages to phagocytose irradiated cancer cells, bLDH is administrated and improves the cross‐presentation of engulfed tumor antigens over tenfold. bLDH limits the activity of phagolysosomal proteases and enables direct major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation in phagosome to improve precision radioimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Failures of radiotherapy (RT) in adaptive antitumor immunomodulation often associate with recruited tissue‐repairing macrophages. Although training these macrophages to phagocytose post‐RT cancer cells reverses their protumoral performance, engulfed tumor antigens are severely underrated. In fact, regulating the processing and presentation of tumor antigens, a key determinant of tumor immunogenicity, can fundamentally affect adaptive immune responses. Here it is reported that a simple Alum‐like adjuvant (MgAl‐based hydrotalcite, bLDH) improves radioimmunotherapy via inducing antigen cross‐presentation by macrophages, independent of phenotypes. It is identified that cytidine monophosphate guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide engenders macrophages to phagocytose irradiated cancer cells. However, as semiprofessional antigen‐presenting cells, macrophages possess powerful proteolytic function that is detrimental to antigen presentation. The administration of alkaline bLDH intriguingly relieves the activity of phagolysosomal proteases with acidic pH optima by preventing phagosomal acidification resulting from the vacuolar‐type ATPase proton pump. The adjuvant‐modulated phagolysosomes thus limit antigen degradation and enhance tumor antigen cross‐presentation over tenfold. To examine from an in vivo breast tumor model, trained macrophages successfully cross‐prime antigen‐specific CD8+ T cells and curb RT‐associated metastasis. The findings propose to pay close attention to the effect of adjuvants on precision immunotherapy and highlight the positive contribution of cross‐presenting macrophages in radioimmunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The therapeutic potential of cancer nanomedicine depends on effective patient stratification. This study introduces a novel “virtual biopsy” method using a radiomics‐based model and routine medical imaging to predict nanomedicine accumulation in tumors. By identifying imaging features associated with biological barriers to drug delivery, the model facilitates more accurate patient stratification and personalized treatment planning, thus advancing precision medicine.








Abstract
Accurately predicting nanomedicine accumulation is critical for guiding patient stratification and optimizing treatment strategies in the context of precision medicine. However, non‐invasive prediction of nanomedicine accumulation remains challenging, primarily due to the complexity of identifying relevant imaging features that predict accumulation. Here, a novel non‐invasive method is proposed that utilizes standard‐of‐care medical imaging modalities, including computed tomography and ultrasound, combined with a radiomics‐based model to predict nanomedicine accumulation in tumor. The model is validated using a test dataset consisting of seven tumor xenografts in mice and three sizes of gold nanoparticles, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.851. The median accumulation levels of tumors predicted as “high accumulators” are 2.69 times greater than those predicted as “low accumulators”. Analysis of this machine‐learning‐driven interpretable radiomics model revealed imaging features that are strongly correlated with dense stroma, a recognized biological barrier to effective nanomedicine delivery. Radiomics‐based prediction of tumor accumulation holds promise for stratifying patient and enabling precise tailoring of nanomedicine treatment strategies.

This study reports robust, 100% field‐free spin‐orbit torque (SOT) switching in a RuO2(101)/[Co/Pt]2/Ta structure. Z‐polarized spins generate out‐of‐plane anti‐damping torque, enabling deterministic switching without an external magnetic field. The altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) in RuO2 enhances anisotropic spin current generation, demonstrating the potential of RuO2 as an efficient spin current source.








Abstract
Altermagnetism, a newly identified class of magnetism blending characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, is emerging as a compelling frontier in spintronics. This study reports a groundbreaking discovery of robust, 100% field‐free spin‐orbit torque (SOT) switching in a RuO2(101)/[Co/Pt]2/Ta structure. The experimental results reveal that the spin currents, induced by the in‐plane charge current, flow along the [100] axis, with the spin polarization direction aligned parallel to the Néel vector. These z‐polarized spins generate an out‐of‐plane anti‐damping torque, enabling deterministic switching of the Co/Pt layer without the necessity of an external magnetic field. The altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) in RuO2 promotes the generation of spin currents with pronounced anisotropic behavior, maximized when the charge current flows along the [010] direction. This unique capability yields the highest field‐free switching ratio, maintaining stable SOT switching even under a wide range of external magnetic fields, demonstrating exceptional resistance to magnetic interference. Notably, the ASSE‐dominated spin current is found to be most effective when the current is aligned with the [010] direction. The study highlights the potential of RuO2 as a powerful spin current generator, opening new avenues for advancing spin‐torque switching technologies and other cutting‐edge spintronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dry battery electrode (DBE) technology simplifies electrode production but relies on PTFE, which faces regulatory and performance challenges. The study introduces a “bollard hitch” dual‐binder system using poly(acrylic acid)‐grafted sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PC) and minimal PTFE, reducing PTFE use by over 70%. This innovation enhances conductivity, flexibility, and mass loading, enabling sustainable, high‐performance battery production.








Abstract
The dry battery electrode (DBE) process offers significant advantages over conventional wet‐coating methods for electrode fabrication. Unlike traditional processes that rely on toxic solvents such as N‐methyl‐2‐pyrrolidone (NMP), the DBE technique uses solvent‐free methods, reducing environmental impact and production costs while enhancing compatibility and performance. However, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the only binder currently used for large‐scale DBE fabrication (binder fibrillation), faces potential regulatory restrictions under Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) guidelines and limits Li‐ion conductivity, elastomeric properties, and particle adhesion. This study explores a novel dual‐binder system, termed the “bollard hitch” model, designed to overcome these limitations as the first PTFE‐less binder for binder fibrillation. Poly(acrylic acid)‐grafted sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (PC) acts as the “bollard,” strongly attaching to the PTFE “anchor.” This binder system reduces PTFE usage by over 70% and enables the fabrication of high‐mass loading cathodes (up to 90 mg cm−2, 15.6 mAh cm−2) with superior performance. It enhances ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, making it suitable for high‐voltage applications and offering great potential to revolutionize the manufacturing of high‐performance, durable energy storage systems.

Remarkably, high epitaxial strain promotes layer‐by‐layer growth and stabilizes the correct phase. The films exhibit a polarization significantly higher than previously reported, exceeding 18 µCcm−2, and retain ferroelectricity down to a single‐unit‐cell thickness, highlighting their potential for advanced nanoscale devices.








Abstract
Layered perovskite‐based compounds offer a range of unconventional properties enabled by their naturally anisotropic structure. Among these, the Carpy‐Galy phases (AnBnO3n+2), characterized by (110)‐oriented perovskite planes interleaved with additional oxygen layers, stand out for robust in‐plane polarization. However, the challenges associated with the synthesis of ultrathin Carpy‐Galy films and understanding the impact of strain on their properties limit their integration into devices. Here, La2Ti2O7 (n = 4) films grown on substrates imposing tensile, compressive, or negligible epitaxial strains are investigated. Surprisingly, a 3% tensile strain from DyScO3 (100) substrates facilitates layer‐by‐layer growth mode, whereas compressive (LaAlO3‐Sr2TaAlO6 (110)) or negligible (SrTiO3 (110)) epitaxial strains require post‐deposition annealing to reach comparable crystallinity. Using density‐functional theory calculations, scanning probe microscopy, X‐ray diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and polarization switching experiments, it is confirmed that these films possess exceptional ferroelectric properties, including a polarization of 18 µCcm−2 – more than three times higher than previously reported – as well as persistence of ferroelectricity down to a single‐unit‐cell thickness. This study not only advances the understanding of Carpy‐Galy phases as epitaxial thin films but also lays a foundation for their integration into advanced ferroelectric device architectures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study demonstrates the use of reactive plasma deposition (RPD) to fabricate indium tin oxide (ITO) buffer layers for wide‐bandgap perovskite solar cells. The RPD‐ITO devices exhibit enhanced thermal stability, reduced recombination losses, and improved efficiency. A four‐terminal tandem cell achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 29.03%, showcasing the potential of RPD for advanced photovoltaics.








Abstract
In this study, the potential of reactive plasma deposition (RPD) is demonstrated for fabricating indium tin oxide (ITO) as an efficient buffer layer in inverted wide‐bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This method results in a certified efficiency of 21.33% for wide‐bandgap PSCs, demonstrating superior thermal stability and operational stability. The optimized devices achieve an impressive open‐circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.252 V with a bandgap of 1.67 eV, resulting in a remarkably low voltage deficit of 0.418 V, attributed to improved electron extraction, reduced interface defects, and suppressed surface recombination. The cells maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1023 h of thermal aging at 88 °C. Furthermore, by integrating a highly efficient semi‐transparent PSC with a CIGS bottom cell, a four‐terminal tandem configuration is achieved with a total efficiency of 29.03%, representing one of the most efficient perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells reported to date. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of RPD for improving the performance and scalability of inverted wide‐bandgap PSCs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work depicts a double confinement design to greatly improve the stability of intermetallic nanoparticles while maintaining their high catalytic activity toward proton exchange membrane fuel cells. This synthesis strategy involves the carbon encapsulation and O2‐assisted pyrolysis process to fabricate carbon‐supported Pt‐based intermetallic nanoparticles with carbon and Pt‐skin confinement.








Abstract
Maintaining the stability of low Pt catalysts during prolonged operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) remains a substantial challenge. Here, a double confinement design is presented to significantly improve the stability of intermetallic nanoparticles while maintaining their high catalytic activity toward PEMFCs. First, a carbon shell is coated on the surface of nanoparticles to form carbon confinement. Second, O2 is introduced during the annealing process to selectively etch the carbon shell to expose the active surface, and to induce the segregation of surface transition metals to form Pt‐skin confinement. Overall, the intermetallic nanoparticles are protected by carbon confinement and Pt‐skin confinement to withstand the harsh environment of PEMFCs. Typically, the double confined Pt1Co1 catalyst exhibits an exceptional mass activity of 1.45 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V in PEMFCs tests, with only a 17.3% decay after 30 000 cycles and no observed structure changes, outperforming most reported PtCo catalysts and DOE 2025 targets. Furthermore, the carbon confinement proportion can be controlled by varying the thickness of the coated carbon shell, and this strategy is also applicable to the synthesis of double‐confined Pt1Fe1 and Pt1Cu1 intermetallic nanoparticles.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By controlling the injection and transport of charge carriers through a novel quantum‐dot‐electrolyte emitting layer, quantum‐dot‐electrolyte light‐emitting diodes (QE‐LEDs) have been developed, exhibiting a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 20.0% and a lifetime (T95) of 3.74  ×  105 h at 100 cd m−2. Besides, the first active‐matrix QE‐LED display with stable emissions (>17.6 years at T95@100 cd m−2) has been fabricated.








Abstract
Electroluminescence (EL) is essential for modern technologies, such as displays, lighting, and optical communications. To date, some kinds of artificial EL devices have been developed, including organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs), quantum‐dot (QD) LEDs, and light‐emitting electrochemical cells. However, issues (e.g., inefficient charge injection, exciton quenching) limit the further EL performance. Here, another promising kind of EL device is reported, which is called QD‐electrolyte LED (QE‐LED). The key feature of QE‐LED is that an ionic liquid is doped into QDs as the electrolyte emitter of multi‐layer device architectures. Both theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that an enhanced interface electric field from the in situ formed electrical double layer is leveraged to improve the charge injection and transport. With the introduction of insulating polymers into QD‐electrolyte emitters, red QE‐LED achieves an external quantum efficiency of 20.5% and a lifetime (T95) over 3.74 × 105 h at the display‐related luminance of 100 cd m−2, indicating that the QE‐LED is among the best EL devices. Furthermore, an active‐matrix QE‐LED display is demonstrated with superior stability that overtakes the commercial benchmark. These results offer an avenue to discover unexplored EL devices and provide potential pathways to enhance charge dynamics for EL devices.

<title>Cooperative Magnetic Interfacial Microrobot Couple for Versatile Non‐Contact Biomedical Applications</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel robotic system that comprises a microrobot couple, characterizing cooperative interactions, non‐contact manipulation, and high cargo transport velocity is introduced. This microrobot couple can switch between capture and release states, facilitating effective cooperation. Using these capabilities, targeted drug delivery in a stomach model is conducted and performed the removal of uterine fibroids in a uterine model.








Abstract
Magnetic interfacial microrobots are increasingly recognized as a promising approach for potential biomedical applications ranging from electronic functionalization to minimally invasive surgery and targeted drug delivery. Nevertheless, existing research faces challenges, including less cooperative interactions, contact‐based cargo manipulation, and slow transport velocity. Here, the cooperative magnetic interfacial microrobot couple (CMIMC) is proposed to address the above challenges. The CMIMC can be maneuvered by a single magnet and readily switched between capture and release states. By leveraging cooperative interactions and meticulous engineering of capillary forces through shape design and surface treatment, the CMIMC demonstrates the ability to perform non‐contact cargo manipulation. Using the synergy of preferred magnetization directions and magnetic field distribution, along with optimization of the resistance‐reducing shape, the CMIMC significantly enhances the cargo transport velocity, reaching 12.2 body length per second. The studies demonstrate various biomedical applications like targeted drug delivery and myomectomy, paving the way for the broad implementation of interfacial microrobots in biomedical fields.

Inhomogeneous ferroelectric instability induced confined phonon mean free path leading to glass‐like thermal transport, and ultra‐high thermoelectric performance in BiSe, Pb co‐doped GeTe.








Abstract
The consequences of broken long‐range atomic arrangement in glasses or amorphous solids are reflected in the temperature dependence of lattice thermal conductivity (κlat). However, the appearance of glassy ultralow κlat in a crystalline solid with high electrical transport like metal is unusual but can have a remarkable impact on the thermoelectric performance of a material. Here, an ultra‐high thermoelectric performance is demonstrated with a maximum figure of merit, zT ≈ 2.7 (≈2.92 with Dulong–Petit heat capacity) via achieving glassy thermal transport along with significant electrical conductivity in ball milled BiSe, Pb co‐doped polycrystalline Ge1.03Te followed by spark plasma sintering. The glassy thermal transport results from the inhomogeneous ferroelectric instability developed due to local polar distortions near the dopant sites, which interacts with soft polar optical modes via strain fluctuations. Resulting structural degeneracy and associated soft vibrations sink heat effectively from acoustic phonons, which along with various nanoscale defects, confine the phonon mean free path (MFP) close to the interatomic distance, rendering the thermal transport glassy. However, the material still maintains a high electrical conductivity at ambient condition due to much longer MFP of the charge carriers. A promising output power density of ≈0.8 W cm−2 for ΔT ≈441 K in double‐leg thermoelectric device demonstrate the potential of this material for mid‐temperature thermoelectric applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To investigate the effects of topological characteristics of polymers on their lymph node (LN) targeting activity and how their molecular weight (MW) influences pharmacokinetics to support LN homing, a series of polymer‐TLR agonist conjugates (PTACs) are designed. Among the conjugates, the dendritic 6‐arm PTAC with an MW of 60 kDa demonstrated the highest LN drainage, deepest penetration, and prolonged retention. As a result, it induced broad antibody and T cell responses, enhancing vaccine immunogenicity and suppressing tumor growth.









Abstract
Strategically targeting lymph nodes (LNs) to orchestrate the initiation and regulation of adaptive immune responses is one of the most pressing challenges in the context of vaccination. Herein, a series of polymer‐TLR agonist conjugates (PTACs) is developed to investigate the impact of dendritic‐topological characteristics on their LN targeting activity in vivo, and their molecular weight (MW) on their pharmacokinetics in support of their LN homing. Notably, the dendritic 6‐arm PTAC with a MW of 60 kDa (6A‐PTAC‐60k) rapidly delivered cargo to draining LNs after administration to peripheral tissues. Specifically, this topologic structure ameliorated the targeting behavior within lymphatic vessels and LNs, including an elevated amount of TLR7/8 agonist delivered to the LNs, an improved distribution pattern among barrier cells and immune cells, increased permeability, and prolonged retention. Furthermore, the 6A‐PTAC‐60k formulation induced broad antibody and T cell responses, enhancing vaccine immunogenicity and suppressing tumor growth. The results revealed that both the topology and MW of polymers are crucial factors for immunoadjuvant distribution and their functional activity in the draining LNs, which, in turn, enhanced the immunogenicity of the vaccine formulation. This study may provide a chemical and structural basis for optimizing the design of immunoadjuvant delivery systems.

Red, green, and blue (R/G/B) colored 2D perovskite nanocrystals synthesized via an ultrasonic spray method demonstrate outstanding photo‐detection performance in 4‐inch photodetector arrays with a 100% operational yield, enabled by a liquid‐bridge‐transport strategy. This scalable, self‐aligned synthesis provides a practical pathway for high‐performance, large‐area perovskite optoelectronic devices and shows promising potential for broader applications in integrated optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
2D perovskite (PVSK) single crystals have received significant attention due to their unique optical and optoelectronic properties. However, current synthesis methods face limitations, particularly in large‐area fabrication, which remain critical barriers to practical applications. In this study, the synthesis of red/green/purple‐blue‐colored 2D PVSK nanocrystals over a large area (4‐inch wafer) and the fabrication of high‐performance photodetector arrays are presented via a facile yet efficient spray‐coating approach with a liquid‐bridge transport effect. The photodetector array achieves 100% working yield, high photo‐responsivity (1.5 × 106 A W−1) and specific‐detectivity (1.1 × 1016 Jones) with competitive photomapping characteristics. An intelligent vision system for automatic shape recognition is further demonstrated with a recognition rate exceeding 90%. This study provides significant advances in the scalable synthesis of nanoscale 2D PVSK crystals, their integration into large‐area optoelectronic devices, and their potential use in artificial‐intelligence systems.

<title>Andrias davidianus Derived Glycosaminoglycans Direct Diabetic Wound Repair by Reprogramming Reparative Macrophage Glucolipid Metabolism</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the skin mucus of Andrias davidianus and its derived engineered microspheres have been shown to promote angiogenesis and modulate the inflammatory microenvironment by inducing the polarization of reparative macrophages, thus contributing to wound healing. This is an excellent paradigm for harnessing cross‐species regenerative capabilities to address impaired wound repair, introducing a novel therapeutic strategy for refractory wounds.








Abstract
Harnessing cross‐species regenerative cues to direct human regenerative potential is increasingly recognized as an excellent strategy in regenerative medicine, particularly for addressing the challenges of impaired wound healing in aging populations. The skin mucus of Andrias davidianus plays a critical role in self‐protection and tissue repair, yet the fundamental regenerative factors and mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, this work presents evidence that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) derived from the skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SAGs) serve as potent mediators of angiogenesis and inflammatory remodeling, facilitating efficient healing of diabetic wounds. Mechanistic studies reveal that SAGs promote macrophage polarization toward an anti‐inflammatory and pro‐regenerative phenotype (CD206+/Arg1+) via glucolipid metabolic reprogramming. This process suppresses excessive inflammation and enhances the expression of VEGF and IL‐10 to create a facilitative microenvironment for tissue regeneration. Additionally, this work develops SAGs‐GelMA composite microspheres that address multiple stages of wound healing, including rapid hemostasis, exudate control, and activation of endogenous regenerative processes. This engineered approach significantly improves the scarless healing of diabetic wounds by facilitating the recruitment and activation of reparative macrophages. The findings offer new insights into the regenerative mechanisms of Andrias davidianus and highlight the potential therapeutic application of SAGs in tissue repair.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Analogic to the design of an anionic framework for inorganic sulfide/oxide solid electrolytes, a copolymeric polycationic electrolyte, P(AT‐MBA‐6F), that leverages the polycationic backbones with fluorinated microdomain trapping effect is constructed, which enables stable, fast and high‐energy all‐solid‐state LMBs at ambient temperature.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are promising for high‐energy and high‐safety solid‐state lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, a polycationic solid electrolyte (PCSE) is described that leverages the inherent high thermal/chemical stability of the polycationic domain and the anion trapping (FMAT) effect of another fluorinated microdomain for stable and fast‐charging high‐voltage LMBs. Specifically, while the polycationic imidazolium backbone ensures high segmental flexibility facilitating the Li+ mobility, the fluorinated microdomain effectively traps the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions by strong dipole interactions, imparting localized solvation and restricted mobility of the anions, as well as improved oxidation stability. As a result, the PCSE exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.4 mS cm−1, a high Li+ transference number of 0.50, and a wide electrochemical window of ∼5.5 V at 25 °C. By way of in situ thermal polymerization of the electrolyte within assembled cells, the PCSE enables ultra‐stable cycling of Li|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cells with a capacity retention of 98.1% after 500 cycles at 0.2 C at ambient temperatures. The work on the molecular design of PCSEs represents a fundamentally unique perspective for the rational design of SPEs with balanced properties that are historically challenging for high‐energy, long‐life, ambient‐temperature solid‐state LMBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The central doping of Pd/Pt atoms and the surface‐motif doping of Cd atoms are concurrently achieved in trimetallic MAu18Cd3 (M = Pd/Pt) nanoclusters, which are synthesized via using the M‐doped Au25 template. This co‐doping strategy can significantly enhance the photoluminescence intensity and efficiency by affecting radiative relaxation and nonradiative relaxation pathways simultaneously.









Abstract
Precise doping is of vital significance for atomic engineering and the establishment of structure‐property relationships in nanocluster (NC) chemistry. Herein, two novel trimetallic MAu18Cd3 (M = Pd/Pt) NCs that are derived from M‐doped Au25 templates of MAu24 are reported, in which the central doping of M atom and the surface‐motif doping of Cd atoms are concurrently achieved. Compared to the original templates, Cd‐induced surface engineering enhances the rigidity of the structural framework and enlarges the HOMO‐LUMO gaps of the MAu18Cd3, significantly improving photoluminescent efficiency by suppressing nonradiative relaxation. The critical role of the central M (Pd/Pt) dopant in photoluminescence, which regulates the rate of radiative decay of excited‐state electrons, has also been substantiated. More notably, the doped case of PtAu18Cd3 exhibits excellent photoinitiation activity in 3D two‐photon printing with a high resolution of ≈140 nm, which may be attributed to the prolonged excited state. Overall, this work provides a generalized routine for the precise synthesis of multi‐metal NCs with concurrent enhancements in photoluminescence and photoinitiation activity, which is expected to stimulate further research for the design and preparation of multi‐functional, multi‐metal NCs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An autonomous, moisture‐driven flexible electrogenerative dressing (AMFED) is developed by integrating a moist‐electric generator, an antibacterial hydrogel dressing, and concentric molybdenum electrodes. This self‐sustaining dressing provides continuous electrical stimulation and exhibits potent antibacterial activity. In vivo studies demonstrate that AMFED effectively accelerates diabetic wound healing.








Abstract
Electrotherapy has shown considerable potential in treating chronic wounds, but conventional approaches relying on bulky external power supplies and mechanical force are limited in their clinical utility. This study introduces an autonomous, moisture‐driven flexible electrogenerative dressing (AMFED) that overcomes these limitations. The AMFED integrates a moist‐electric generator (MEG), an antibacterial hydrogel dressing, and concentric molybdenum (Mo) electrodes to provide a self‐sustaining electrical supply and potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The MEG harnesses chemical energy from moisture to produce a stable direct current of 0.61 V without external input, delivering this therapeutic electrical stimulation to the wound site through the Mo electrodes. The AMFED facilitates macrophage polarization toward reparative M2 phenotype and regulates inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, in vivo studies suggest that the AMFED group significantly enhances chronic wound healing, with an approximate 41% acceleration compared to the control group. Using a diabetic mouse wound model, the AMFED demonstrates its effectiveness in promoting nerve regulation, epithelial migration, and vasculogenesis. These findings present a novel and efficient platform for accelerating chronic wound healing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Single crystal microcavity organic light‐emitting diodes (SC‐MC‐OLEDs) with high color purity (FWHM < 10 nm), high brightness (> 106 cd m−2), high efficiency (EQE∼4%), high polarization (> 0.90) and high stability are realized by combining the large size 2D organic single crystals with efficient microcavity effect, unlocking potential for ultra‐high‐definition displays and AR/VR applications.








Abstract
The development of ultra‐high‐definition (UHD) displays demands organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) with high color purity of all three primary colors for a wide color gamut and high brightness essential for future AR/VR applications. However, the vibronic coupling in organic emitters typically results in broad emissions, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) exceeding 40–50 nm. Herein, multicolor organic single‐crystal microcavity light‐emitting diodes (SC‐MC‐OLEDs) are demonstrated by embedding ultrathin 2D organic single crystals (2D‐OSCs) between two silver layers that serve as both electrodes and mirrors. By leveraging the microcavity effect, the resonant output frequencies of SC‐MC‐OLEDs can be continuously tuned from 448 to 602 nm by adjusting the thickness of 2D‐OSCs (i.e., the microcavity length), achieving high color purity with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of <10 nm. Furthermore, the Purcell effect in SC‐MC‐OLEDs enhances the radiative rate and improves light‐coupling efficiency, resulting in a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of up to 4% and minimal efficiency roll‐off. Due to the excellent bipolar transport properties of OSCs, the brightness of SC‐MC‐OLEDs surpasses 106 cd m−2, along with a degree of linear polarization exceeding 0.9, unlocking new application opportunities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel self‐rolling integration strategy mounts ultrathin (≈2 µm) poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide)/Au microactuators onto optical fiber tapers, achieving unprecedented bending angles (>800°) and rapid response (≈0.55 s). This waveguide microactuator enables dynamic capture of fast‐moving microorganisms and provides a high‐performance, versatile platform for biomedical applications in confined, unstructured environments.








Abstract
Precisely capturing and manipulating microscale objects, such as individual cells and microorganisms, is fundamental to advancements in biomedical research and microrobotics. Photoactuators based on optical fibers serving as flexible, unobstructed waveguides are well‐suited for these operations, particularly in confined locations where free‐space illumination is impractical. However, integrating optical fibers with microscale actuators poses significant challenges due to size mismatch, resulting in slow responses inadequate for handling motile micro‐objects. This study designs microactuators based on hydrogel/Au bilayer heterostructures that self‐roll around a tapered optical fiber. This self‐rolling mechanism enables the use of thin hydrogel layers only a few micrometers thick, which rapidly absorb and release water molecules during a phase transition. The resulting microactuators exhibit low bending stiffness and extremely fast responses, achieving large bending angles exceeding 800° within 0.55 s. Using this technique, this study successfully captures rapidly swimming Chlamydomonas and Paramecium, and demonstrates programmable non‐reciprocal motion for effective non‐contact manipulation of yeast cells. This approach provides a versatile platform for microscale manipulations and holds promise for advanced biomedical applications.

<title>Low‐Volatility Fused‐Ring Solid Additive Engineering for Synergistically Elongating Exciton Lifetime and Mitigating Trap Density Toward Organic Solar Cells of 20.5% Efficiency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
3,6‐dibromothieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (3,6TTBr) is selected as a representative low‐volatility fused‐ring solid additive to elucidate the mechanism of photovoltaic performance. The integrated theoretical and experimental study reveals that 3,6TTBr's rigid, planar molecules interact with the terminal units of L8‐BO, facilitating spacing for neighboring molecules. To validate the broader applicability of the findings, 1,5‐dibromonaphthalene (1,5‐BN) is examined, achieving a notable PCE of 20.5%.








Abstract
Volatile solid additives (VSAs) with single or fused‐ring structures have attracted much attention for enhancing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). While the working mechanisms of high‐volatility single‐ring additives have been well studied, the influence of low‐volatility fused‐ring VSAs on molecular aggregations and exciton/carrier dynamics remains still unclear. Herein, 3,6‐dibromothieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (3,6TTBr) is selected as a representative low‐volatility fused‐ring VSA to elucidate its working mechanism. Via the theoretical and experimental joint investigation, it is found that rigid and planar 3,6TTBr molecules adsorb onto the terminal units of L8‐BO (acceptor), inducing loose space for adjacent molecules. The low‐volatility 3,6TTBr thus favors the L8‐BO center‐terminal packing with a larger interfragment distance, which relieves the L8‐BO over‐aggregation and induces the ordered packing. Consequently, the 3,6TTBr treatment reduces aggregation‐caused quenching, enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield and exciton lifetime of L8‐BO film. The combination of the above properties with the reduced trap density and improved carrier transport in the 3,6TTBr‐treated devices contributed to PCE of 20.1%. To validate the broad applicability of the findings, 1,5‐dibromonaphthalene (1,5‐BN), another low‐volatility fused‐ring solid, is explored. The devices with 1,5‐BN achieved an impressive PCE of 20.5%, verifying the validity of the low‐volatility fused‐ring VSA strategy for boosting OSC performances.

<title>DNA‐Capturing Manganese‐Coordinated Chitosan Microparticles Potentiate Radiotherapy via Activating the cGAS‐STING Pathway and Maintaining Tumor‐Infiltrating CD8+ T‐Cell Stemness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
DNA‐capturing CS‐Mn microparticles are prepared to potentiate radioimmunotherapy. Upon injection into the tumors after X‐ray irradiation, they undergo rapid dissociation to release chitosan which assembles with the extracellular DNA fragments released from the dead cancer cells to in situ form CS‐DNA complexes and synergize with Mn2+ to stimulate DC maturation via activating the cGAS‐STING pathway for enhanced CD8+ T‐cell stemness.








Abstract
The radiotherapy‐induced release of DNA fragments can stimulate the cyclic guanosine monophosphate‐adenosine monophosphate synthase‐stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS‐STING) pathway to prime antitumor immunity, but this pathway is expected to be less potent because of the inefficient cytosolic delivery of negatively charged DNA fragments. In this study, manganese‐coordinated chitosan (CS‐Mn) microparticles with selective DNA‐capturing capacity are concisely prepared via a coordination‐directed one‐pot synthesis process to potentiate the immunogenicity of radiotherapy. The obtained CS‐Mn microparticles that undergo rapid disassembly under physiological conditions can selectively bind with DNA to form positively charged DNA‐CS assemblies because of the strong electrostatic interaction between linear chitosan and DNA molecules. They thus enable efficient cytosolic delivery of DNA in the presence of serum to cooperate with Mn2+ to activate the cGAS‐STING pathway in dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral injection, the CS‐Mn microparticles markedly enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy against both irradiated and distal tumors in different tumor models via collectively promoting tumor‐infiltrating CD8+ T‐cell stemness and the activation of innate immunity. The radiosensitization effect of CS‐Mn microparticles can be further augmented by concurrently applying anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 (anti‐PD‐1) immunotherapy. This work highlights an ingenious strategy to prepare Trojan horse‐like DNA‐capturing microparticles as cGAS‐STING‐activating radiosensitizers for effective radioimmunotherapy.

<title>Glucose Metabolism‐Targeted Poly(amino acid) Nanoformulation of Oxaliplatin(IV)‐Aspirin Prodrug for Enhanced Chemo‐Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A glucose metabolism‐targeted nanoformulation (NP/OXA‐ASP2) is designed to inhibit lactate efflux while inducing mitochondrial stress to boost immunogenic cell death, thus synergistically reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by decreasing the proportion of immunosuppressive cells (Tregs and MDSCs) and increasing the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and plays an enhanced efficacy of chemo‐immunotherapy to colon cancer.








Abstract
Inappropriate glucose metabolism in cancer cells is associated with immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Although glycolysis inhibition enhances T cell‐mediated immune responses, the integrated platforms combining glycolysis inhibition with immunotherapy remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, a glucose metabolism‐targeted poly(amino acid) nanoformulation of oxaliplatin(IV)‐aspirin prodrug (NP/OXA‐ASP2) is developed to improve chemo‐immunotherapy by suppressing tumor glycolysis. This poly(amino acid) nanoparticle exhibits selective release, discharging 90.0% of OXA‐ASP2 under reductive conditions within 36 h. Furthermore, over 80% of the prodrug converts to OXA and ASP within 12 h, promoting mitochondrial damage and glycolysis inhibition, which amplifies immunogenic cell death induced by OXA. In addition, suppressing glycolytic flux reduces lactate leakage, mitigating the immunosuppressive TMEs. Together, these mechanisms contribute to stronger chemo‐immunotherapy efficacy. Compared to the OXA plus ASP formulation, NP/OXA‐ASP2 demonstrates superior performances, reducing lactate levels at the tumor site by 25.4%, increasing the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by 1.53 times, decreasing the proportion of regulatory T cells by 2.20 times, and improving 1.39‐fold of the tumor inhibition rate. These findings underscore that NP/OXA‐ASP2 is a promising platform for integrating tumor metabolic regulation with immunomodulation and holds significant potential for advancing clinical chemo‐immunotherapy.

<title>Record Efficiency of β‐Phase PVDF‐MXene Composites in Thin‐Film Dielectric Capacitors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
MXenes are delaminated in a green organic solvent to achieve large flake size and polymer compatibility. PVDF composites are produced through non‐solvent‐induced phase separation to tune the structure and properties of thin‐film dielectric capacitors. MXenes with both mixed and pure chlorine terminations enhance the dielectric properties of PVDF, reaching energy density above 45 J cm−3 and 95% efficiency.








Abstract
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a semicrystalline polymer used in thin‐film dielectric capacitors because of its inherently high dielectric constant and low loss tangent. Its dielectric constant can be increased by the formation and alignment of its β‐phase crystalline structure, which can be facilitated by 2D nanofillers. 2D carbides and nitrides, MXenes, are promising candidates due to their notable dielectric permittivity and ability to increase interfacial polarization. Still, their mixing is challenging due to weak interfacial interactions and poor dispersibility of MXenes in PVDF. This work explores a novel method for delaminating Ti3C2Tx MXene directly into organic solvents while maintaining flake size and quality, as well as the use of a non‐solvent‐induced phase separation method for producing both dense and porous PVDF‐MXene composite films. A deeper understanding of dielectric behavior in these composites is reached by examining MXenes with both mixed and pure chlorine terminations in PVDF matrices. Thin‐film capacitors fabricated from these composites display ultrahigh discharge energy density, exceeding 45 J cm−3 with 95% efficiency. The PVDF‐MXene composites are also processed using a green and sustainable solvent, propylene carbonate.

<title>Glucose‐Activated Programmed Hydrogel with Self‐Switchable Enzyme‐Like Activity for Infected Diabetic Wound Self‐Adaptive Treatment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The self‐switching enzyme‐like activity of the hydrogel activated by the hyperglycemia environment induces the opening of the hypoxia‐sensitive microcapsules, regulates the dynamic stability of blood glucose through intelligent insulin delivery. The hydrogel dynamically regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) through self‐switching enzyme‐like activity, produces ROS through peroxidase‐like activity to achieve antibacterial, and promotes infected diabetic wound healing by converting ROS to release oxygen.








Abstract
The defective blood glucose regulation ability of diabetic patients leading to bacterial infection, cellular oxidative stress, and vascular damage results in delayed healing of chronic diabetic wounds. Here, a glucose‐activated self‐switching enzyme‐like activity programmed hydrogel is proposed to provide self‐regulated timely intelligent insulin release affected by blood glucose fluctuations, thereby forming feedback blood glucose management and exerting a full‐stage wound healing. The hydrogel is composed of Au─MoS2─phenylboronic acid nanozyme and insulin‐loaded nitroimidazole‐modified sodium alginate hypoxia‐sensitive microcapsules and penylboronic‐acid‐modified chitosan. It utilizes glucose as a sacrificial agent to generate antibacterial reactive oxygen species by recognizing the hyperglycemia environment, and releasing insulin for blood glucose regulation for up to 12 h with the help of the enzyme‐like catalysis‐generated hypoxia environment. In a normoglycemia environment, the hydrogel switches the enzyme‐like activity to supply oxygen, inhibiting further insulin release. The hydrogel achieves ≈3 times the wound recovery rate of commercial dressings through blood glucose regulation and improved wound microenvironment. The hydrogel has been proven to significantly improve the healing of chronic diabetic wounds by regulating the body's blood glucose homeostasis and implementing a staged healing treatment plan, providing a powerful solution for diabetic wound care.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
TADF sensitizers targeting deep‐blue emitters are designed by combining the advantages of short‐range and long‐range charge‐transfer excited states. The resulting sensitizers enable high‐performance deep‐blue OLEDs with BT. 2020 blue gamut together with external quantum efficiency approaching 40%.








Abstract
The hyperfluorescence (HF) technology holds great promise for the development of high‐quality organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs) for their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and low‐efficiency roll‐off. Sensitizer plays a crucial role in the performance of HF devices. However, designing sensitizers with simultaneous high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), rapid radiative decay (kr), and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) poses a great challenge, particularly for the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers targeting deep‐blue HF device. Herein, by introducing a boron‐containing multi‐resonance‐type acceptor into the multi‐tert‐butyl‐carbazole encapsulated benzene molecular skeleton, two TADF emitters featuring hybridized multi‐channel charge‐transfer pathways, including short‐range multi‐resonance, weakened through‐bond, and compact face‐to‐face through‐space charge‐transfer. Benefiting from the rational molecular design, the proof‐of‐concept sensitizers exhibit simultaneous rapid kr of 5.3 × 107 s−1, fast kRISC up to 5.9 × 105 s−1, a PQLY of near‐unity, as well as ideal deep‐blue emission in both solution and film. Consequently, the corresponding deep‐blue HF devices not only achieve chromaticity coordinates that fully comply with the latest BT. 2020 standards, but also showcase record‐high maximum external quantum efficiencies nearing 40%, along with suppressed efficiency roll‐off.

<title>Control Over Metal‐Halide Reactivity Enables Uniform Growth of InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots for Enhanced SWIR Light Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, it is demonstrated that controlling metal halide precursors' reactivity with organic additives during nucleation and growth enables the synthesis of InSb CQDs with narrow size distributions. Alkanethiol resurfacing facilitates efficient ligand exchange and integration into n‐i‐p photodiodes, exhibiting 10¹2 Jones detectivity, 33% EQE at 1380 nm, and >19 h of operational stability.








Abstract
InSb colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) hold promise in short‐wave infrared sensing; however, their synthesis presents ongoing challenges, particularly in achieving precise size control – this is the result of poorly controlled reactivity among the precursors. Herein, the use of alkyl‐phosphine and amine‐based organic additives to control the reactivity of In and Sb precursors during the nucleation and growth of CQDs is developed. This interplay between organic additive and precursors enables the synthesis of InSb CQDs having narrowed size distributions; and bandgaps tunable across the 1.2–1.5 µm spectral range; all this leading to peak‐to‐valley ratios >1.4 in absorption spectra. The CQDs are surface‐terminated with a mixture of oleylamine, halides, and oxide‐like species, and this hinders ligand exchange reactions and subsequent integration into photodiodes. We therefore resurface the CQDs with alkanethiols, displacing the native ligands via an acid‐base mechanism, an approach that removes oxide species. Using a layer‐by‐layer fabrication process, the ligands of the resurfaced InSb CQDs are exchanged with short organic and halide ligands and incorporated films into n‐i‐p photodiode structures. The resultant devices exhibit a detectivity of 10¹2 Jones, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33% at 1380 nm, and T90 operating stability of >19 h under continuous illuminated operation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By virtue of the tailor‐made Pt electronic configuration and excellently corrosion‐resistant carbon support, the O‐PtCo@GCoNC integrating PtCo intermetallic with a Pt‐rich shell and highly graphitized carbon exhibits significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability, attaining outstanding performance in H2/air PEMFC, outstripping the United States Department of Energy 2025 target.








Abstract
Exploiting robust and high‐efficiency electrocatalysts for sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) toward long‐term operation for practical applications, yet remains challenging. Herein, the ordered PtCo intermetallic is reported with a Pt‐rich shell loaded on a highly graphitized carbon carrier (O‐PtCo@GCoNC) prepared by an impregnation annealing strategy. Systematic X‐ray spectroscopic, operando electrochemical techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that thanks to the synergistic interaction of the core–shell PtCo intermetallic structure with a tailor‐made Pt electronic configuration and highly graphitized carbon, O‐PtCo@GCoNC exhibits significantly enhanced activity and stability toward ORR. Crucially, O‐PtCo@GCoNC delivers a much‐enhanced mass activity of 0.83 A mgPt−1 at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m HClO4, which only drops by 26.5% after 70 000 cycles (0.6–1.0 V vs RHE), and 10.8% after 10 000 cycles (1.0–1.5 V vs RHE), apparently overmatching Pt/C (0.19 A mgPt−1, 73.7%, and 63.1%). Moreover, O‐PtCo@GCoNC employed as the cathode catalyst in H2/air PEMFC achieves a superb peak power density (1.04 W cm−2 at 2.06 A cm−2), outperforming that of Pt/C (0.86 W cm−2 at 1.79 A cm−2). The cell voltage loss at 0.8 A cm−2 is 28 mV after 30 000 cycles, outstripping the United States Department of Energy 2025 target.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
We leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing to introduce Morpho‐Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE‐PoL), a stain‐ and contact‐free imaging methodology that quantitatively assesses the microstructural properties of fibrous biological tissues. We demonstrate the potential of MorE‐PoL with patient‐derived xenograft breast cancer tissues, where we quantify the density and organization of fibrillar collagen in the tumor microenvironment.









Abstract
Changes in the density and organization of fibrous biological tissues often accompany the progression of serious diseases ranging from fibrosis to neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease and cancer. However, challenges in cost, complexity, or precision faced by existing imaging methodologies and materials pose barriers to elucidating the role of tissue microstructure in disease. Here, we leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing and introduce Morpho‐Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE‐PoL), a stain‐ and contact‐free imaging platform that enhances and quantifies the birefringent material properties of fibrous biological tissues. We develop a mathematical model, based on Jones calculus, which describes fibrous tissue density and organization. As a representative example, we analyzed collagen‐dense and collagen‐sparse human breast cancer tissue sections and leverage our technique to assess the microstructural properties of distinct regions of interest. We compare our results with conventional Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining procedures and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy for fibrillar collagen detection. Our findings demonstrate that our MorE‐PoL technique provides a robust, quantitative, and accessible route toward analyzing biological tissue microstructures, with great potential for application to a broad range of biological materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A universal strategy to enhance the performance and mechanical stability of flexible perovskite near‐infrared (NIR) photodetector arrays is demonstrated through a combination of self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) bridging interface and stress release of nano‐array structure, presenting the maximum response wavelength of 1050 nm, a responsivity of 1.66 A W−1, detectivity of 6.19 × 1012 Jones, high fidelity imaging, and extra‐long environmental stability.








Abstract
Perovskite photodetectors with superior optoelectronic properties, lightweight, and compatibility with flexible substrates have attracted much attention in wearable electronics. However, the large bandgap, inherent brittleness, poor environmental stability, and weak interfacial adhesion interaction between perovskites and substrates hinder the application of near‐infrared (NIR) wearable devices. Herein, a universal strategy to enhance the performance and mechanical stability of flexible perovskite NIR photodetector arrays is demonstrated through a combination of mussel‐inspired self‐assembled monolayer (SAM) bridging interface and precise modulation of the nano‐array size, which enables to significantly increase interfacial adhesion, crystallinity, crystallographic orientation, and reduce mechanical stresses of perovskite single‐crystal arrays. Moreover, inserting paddle‐wheel metal–organic cluster ligands lead to an unprecedented small bandgap of 1.04 eV, enhanced lattice rigidity, and environmental stability for 2D perovskite. The flexible perovskite NIR photodetector arrays with superior mechanical robustness and record NIR performance are revealed with a maximum response wavelength of 1050 nm, a responsivity of 1.66 A W−1, detectivity of 6.19 × 1012 Jones, high fidelity imaging, and extra‐long environmental stability. This work pioneers a new insight into the integration of high‐performance and mechanically durable perovskite flexible wearable devices.

<title>Tumor‐Targeted Glutamine Metabolism Blocker Synergizes with TiO2‐Au Janus Nanoparticles for Enhanced Sono‐Metabolic Antitumor Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sono‐metabolic nano‐composites (TiO2‐Au@DON) produce huge amounts of ROS (type I and type II) under ultrasound irradiation, effectively inducing immunogenic cell death via TiO2‐Au‐induced‐SDT phenomena. The released DON disrupts NADPH and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT‐mediated oxidative stress, offering a precise combination of SDT and immunotherapy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising therapeutic modality known for its non‐invasiveness, temporal‐spatial controllability, and deeper tissue penetration. However, the SDT treatment efficacy is still hampered by the scarcity of ideal sonosensitizers and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these challenges, a sono‐metabolic nano‐composite (TiO2‐Au@DON) using the metabolic reprogramming prodrugs of 6‐Diazo‐5‐oxo‐l‐norleucine (DON) grafted on TiO2‐Au Janus nanoparticles (NPs) is fabricated. The coupling of TiO2 and gold in the TiO2‐Au@DON effectively prevents the fast recombination of excited electrons and holes under ultrasound irradiation. The result is the generation of higher levels of both type I and II reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to pure TiO2, which helps overcome the limitations of SDT in the hypoxic TME. Furthermore, the TiO2‐Au Janus NPs act as nano‐carriers, delivering DON prodrugs to the tumor site. The released DON can disrupt nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming the metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT‐mediated oxidative stress, resulting in the increase of tumor sensitivity to ROS through TiO2‐Au@DON‐integrated synergistic effects of SDT and glutamine reprogramming strategies. This increased sensitivity ultimately induces robust immunogenic cell death (ICD), enhancing antitumor therapeutic efficacy and remodeling the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Researchers have developed a two‐terminal AlScN/p‐i‐n GaN heterojunction ferroelectric memristor with ultraviolet photoelectric synapse function, enabling nonvolatile memory and optoelectronic synaptic characteristics. This innovation achieves a high memory on/off ratio and a relatively low synaptic energy consumption, advancing optoelectronics and artificial vision systems with potential applications in on‐chip sensing and computing.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials represent a frontier in semiconductor research, offering the potential for novel optoelectronics. AlScN material is a kind of outstanding ferroelectric semiconductor with strong residual polarization, high Curie temperature, and mainstream semiconductor fabrication compatibility. However, it is challenging to realize multi‐state optical responders due to their limited light sensitivity. Here, a two‐terminal AlScN/p‐i‐n GaN heterojunction ultraviolet optoelectronic synapse is fabricated, overcoming this limitation by leveraging hole capture at the AlScN/p‐GaN hetero‐interface for multi‐state modulation. The novel structure maintains excellent memristor characteristics based on the ferroelectric of AlScN, realizing an on/off ratio of 9.36 × 105. More importantly, the device can mimic synaptic characteristics essential for artificial vision systems, achieving an image recognition accuracy of 93.7% with a weight evolution nonlinearity of 0.26. This approach not only extends the applications of AlScN in optoelectronics but also paves the way for advanced artificial vision systems with image preprocessing and recognition capabilities. The findings provide a step forward in the development of non‐volatile memories with potential for on‐chip sensing and computing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Can lignin revolutionize lithium‐ion battery separators? A single‐layer lignin‐based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15 µm) is fabricated using a dry fibrillation method, enabling exceptional thermal stability, low energy consumption, and full material utilization. Sulfonate functional groups enhance interfacial stability, significantly improving cycling in graphite||NMC811 and Si‐Gr||NMC811 cells. This scalable, sustainable approach paves the way for next‐generation functional separators.








Abstract
Separators are critical components in lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs), preventing internal short circuits, mitigating thermal runaway, and influencing rate capability and cycling performance. However, current polyolefin separators suffer from limitations, such as high thermal shrinkage, relatively poor wettability, and inadequate long‐term stability, impacting safety and cycle life in critical applications like electric vehicles. Here, a single‐layer lignin‐based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15 µm) with exceptional intrinsic thermal stability and cycling performance is demonstrated. The separator is fabricated using lignosulfonate, a natural polymer derived as a byproduct of chemical pulping and biorefinery processes. By employing a dry fibrillation method, the process achieves low energy consumption and a 100% raw material conversion rate, highlighting its scalability and sustainability. Interfacial studies reveal the improved cycling performance in both graphite||NMC811 and Si‐Gr||NMC811 cells is attributed to the abundant sulfonate functional groups in lignosulfonates, which promote the formation of a sulfur‐rich cathode/solid electrolyte interphases (CEI/SEI) with low resistance in both the cathode and anode. The high thermal stability, manufacturing feasibility, battery performance, and low cost of such lignin‐based separators offer new inspiration for developing next‐generation, single‐layer functional separators tailored for high‐performance LIBs.

VAFe bionic cartilage hydrogel with a double‐network semi‐crosslinked chain entanglement structure and motion‐driven magnetoelectric‐coupled cyclic transformation effect shows the high water content, a porous structure, good mechanical properties, and the electromagnetic effect of the bionic cartilage, which provides a functional compensation and a suitable induced environment for the defective cartilage repair.








Abstract
Enhancing defective cartilage repair by creating a bionic cartilage hydrogel supplemented with in situ electromagnetic stimulation, replicating endogenous electromagnetic effects, remains challenging. To achieve this, a unique three‐phase solvent system is designed to prepare a magnetoelectric bionic cartilage hydrogel incorporating piezoelectric poly(3‐hydroxybutyric acid‐3‐hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV) and magnetostrictive triiron tetraoxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) into sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel to form a dual‐network, semi‐crosslinked chain entanglement structure. The synthesized hydrogel features similar composition, structure, and mechanical properties to natural cartilage. In addition, after the implantation of cartilage, the motion‐driven magnetoelectric‐coupled cyclic transformation model is triggered by gentle joint forces, initiating a piezoelectric response that leads to magnetoelectric‐coupled cyclic transformation. The freely excitable and cyclically enhanced electromagnetic stimulation it can provide, by simulating and amplifying endogenous electromagnetic effects, obtains induced defective cartilage repair efficacy superior to piezoelectric or magnetic stimulation alone.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review investigates technological trends in brain‐inspired artificial reconfigurable memristors, as well as individual non‐volatile and volatile devices, according to their operating principles and fabrication methods. It examines case studies of artificial neural network system implementations based on these devices, providing the latest comprehensive design guidelines from fundamentals to advanced systems.








Abstract
The ongoing global energy crisis has heightened the demand for low‐power electronic devices, driving interest in neuromorphic computing inspired by the parallel processing of human brains and energy efficiency. Reconfigurable memristors, which integrate both volatile and non‐volatile behaviors within a single unit, offer a powerful solution for in‐memory computing, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck that limits conventional computing architectures. These versatile devices combine the high density, low power consumption, and adaptability of memristors, positioning them as superior alternatives to traditional complementary metal‐oxide‐semiconductor (CMOS) technology for emulating brain‐like functions. Despite their potential, studies on reconfigurable memristors remain sparse and are often limited to specific materials such as Mott insulators without fully addressing their unique reconfigurability. This review specifically focuses on reconfigurable memristors, examining their dual‐mode operation, diverse physical mechanisms, structural designs, material properties, switching behaviors, and neuromorphic applications. It highlights the recent advancements in low‐power‐consumption solutions within memristor‐based neural networks and critically evaluates the challenges in deploying reconfigurable memristors as standalone devices or within artificial neural systems. The review provides in‐depth technical insights and quantitative benchmarks to guide the future development and implementation of reconfigurable memristors in low‐power neuromorphic computing.

A Co‐rich high‐entropy oxide (HEO) catalyst enables efficient electrochemical methane‐to‐ethanol conversion at room temperature. By leveraging elemental enrichment, the catalyst achieves high selectivity and stability, outperforming conventional systems. Process modeling further highlights its economic viability and significant potential for reducing carbon emissions.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of methane offers a sustainable alternative to traditional thermochemical syngas pathways; however, the rational design of catalysts that ensure high productivity remains a significant challenge. In this study, a high‐entropy oxide (HEO) catalyst composed of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni is explored, with a targeted element enriched, and identify that a Co‐rich HEO demonstrates high efficiency in room‐temperature electrochemical methane conversion. This analysis of the projected density of states (PDOS) reveals that Co sites in the HEO catalyst possess an optimally positioned p‐band center for methane activation. The Co‐rich HEO catalyst achieves an ethanol production rate of 12315 µmol/gcat/hr at 1.6 VRHE, with a Faradaic efficiency of 63.5%; a flow cell electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst achieves continuous methane‐to‐ethanol conversion at a rate of 26533 µmol/gcat/hr over 100 h. Process modeling evaluates the economic and environmental implications, demonstrating that a commercially viable process can be realized through economies of scale while significantly reducing CO₂ emissions.

<title>Establishing Nanoscale Circuitry by Designing a Structure with Atomic Short‐range Order for High‐Rate Energy Storage</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A microsized perovskite oxide Ce0.266W0.1Nb0.9O3 is engineered as an anode material for high‐rate, long‐life Li+ storage, demonstrating impressive performance by maintaining both high areal capacity and high rate capability, even at high mass loadings. This outstanding electrochemical behavior is primarily attributed to the nanoscale circuitry formed by an atomic‐scale short‐range order structure.








Abstract
High‐rate materials necessitate the rapid transportation of both electrons and ions, a requirement that becomes especially challenging at practical mass loadings (>10 mg cm2). To address this challenge, a material is designed with an architecture having atomic‐scale short‐range order. This design establishes internal nanoscale circuitry at the particle level, which facilitates rapid electronic and ionic transport within micrometer‐sized niobium tungsten oxides. The architecture features alternating cerium‐depleted and cerium‐enriched regions. The continuous cerium‐enriched regions with enhanced conductivity provide multilane highways for electron mobility by functioning as electron‐conducting wires that significantly boost the overall conductivity. The cerium‐depleted regions effectively mitigate electrostatic repulsion and promote rapid ion transport through ion‐conducting channels. These structural characteristics provide a continuous network that supports both electrical migration and chemical diffusion to amplify the areal capacity and rate capability even at high mass loadings. These findings not only expand the fundamental understanding of the design of optimal host lattices for advanced energy storage systems but also of the practical application of microsized high‐rate electrode materials.

<title>Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia by Superionic Conductor with Mixed Ion/Electron Conduction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A van der Waals FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) with enhanced mixed electronic/ionic conductivity is applied for solar‐driven nitrate conversion to ammonia. The migration of mobile lithium ions between layers significantly promotes the electronic conductivity of FePS2.66Li0.87 SIC, which achieves a remarkable ammonia synthesis yield (134.18 µmol cm−2 h−1) under low bias voltage.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) nitrate reduction shows substantial potential for solar‐to‐ammonia (NH3) conversion. However, low electron density and disordered electron conduction of conventional catalysts result in limited performance and low Faraday efficiency. Herein, a FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) is developed by introducing lithium ions into van der Waals immobile layered of FePS3 catalyst. This layered crystal framework facilitates high‐concentration lithium ions confinement and long‐range diffusion at room temperature, transitioning the conduction mechanism from electronic to mixed ionic/electronic. The typical nanofluidic ion transport leads to a high ionic conductivity of 16.4 mS cm−1 at room temperature and enhanced electronic conductivity of 5 × 10−6 S cm−1. Furthermore, mobile lithium ions within interlayers enhance the interaction between the low‐lying 3dyz orbitals of Fe interacting with 2a2 empty antibonding orbitals of NO3−. An excellent PEC ammonia production of 134.18 µmol cm−2 h−1 with 96.95% Faradaic efficiency is achieved, and the corresponding solar‐to‐NH3 efficiency of 57.13% offers a promising pathway toward sustainable ammonia production.

<title>Critical Roles of Ultrafast Energy Funnelling and Ultrafast Singlet‐Triplet Annihilation in Quasi‐2D Perovskite Optical Gain Mechanisms</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultrafast broadband photoluminescence spectroscopy provides insights into the lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet‐triplet annihilation in mixed‐layer quasi‐2D perovskites. Rapid energy funnelling to the sites of amplified spontaneous emission occurs within sub‐picosecond timescales. However, the accumulation of triplet excitons effectively quenches incoming singlet excitons, creating a bottleneck in the energy cascade and hindering the development of population inversion.









Abstract
Quasi‐2D (Q2D) perovskite possess considerable potential for light emission and amplification technologies. Recently, mixed films containing Q2D perovskite grains with varying layer thicknesses have shown great promise as carrier concentrators, effectively mitigating trap‐mediated recombination. In this strategy, photo‐excitations are rapidly funnelled down an energy gradient to the thickest grains, leading to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). However, the quantum‐confined Q2D slabs also stabilize the formation of unwanted triplet excitons, resulting in parasitic quenching of emissive singlet states. Here, a novel ultrafast photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to study photoexcitation dynamics in mixed‐layer Q2D perovskites. By analysing spectra with high temporal and energy resolution, this is found that sub‐picosecond energy transfer to ASE sites is accompanied by excitation losses due to triplet formation on grains with small and intermediate thicknesses. Further accumulation of triplets creates a bottleneck in the energy cascade, effectively quenching incoming singlet excitons. This ultrafast annihilation within 200 femtosecond outpaces energy transfer to ASE sites, preventing the build‐up of population inversion. This study highlights the significance of investigating photoexcitation dynamics on ultrafast timescales, encompassing lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet‐triplet annihilation, to gain crucial insights into the photophysics of the optical gain process in Q2D perovskites.

A novel amphiphilic polymer Torlon‐based membrane with switchable superwettability is developed using a simple one‐step phase separation method. Its hierarchical porous structure and surface reorganization enable exceptional oil‐water separation with ultrahigh permeance and efficiency. The membrane exhibits excellent antifouling, self‐cleaning, and durability, offering a scalable solution for advanced oily wastewater treatment and beyond.








Abstract
The development of advanced membranes with switchable superwettability has attracted considerable attention for the efficient treatment of oily wastewater. However, challenges persist in designing and fabricating such membranes through straightforward methods. In this study, a novel strategy is presented to design switchable superwettable membranes based on micro/nano‐structured porous surfaces and surface chemical composition reorganization. A commercial amphiphilic polymer, polyamide‐imide (Torlon), is fabricated into a porous symmetric membrane with a hierarchical surface structure using a one‐step non‐solvent‐induced phase separation method. By leveraging the surface reorganization capability of amphiphilic polymers and the hierarchically porous structure, the resulting membranes demonstrate exceptional superamphiphilicity in air, underwater superoleophobicity, and underoil superhydrophobicity. These properties enable ultrahigh permeance and separation efficiency for oil‐in‐water, water‐in‐oil, and crude oil/water emulsions through a gravity‐driven process, eliminating the need for external energy. Furthermore, the membranes exhibit excellent antifouling and self‐cleaning performance, maintaining stable operation over multiple cycles. This work provides an innovative and scalable approach to next‐generation switchable superwettable membranes with broad potential applications in oily wastewater treatment and beyond.

<title>A Multifunctional Binder for Current‐Collector‐Free Zn Powder Anodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By introducing abundant polar groups as Zn2+ absorption sites and hydrogen bond arrays, a protein structure‐derived binder for ZP anode and iodine cathode is proposed. This design can regulate the Zn2+ flux, benefit the formation of free‐standing electrode, inhibit the side reactions, suppress the shuttle effect of polyiodides, and enable the large‐scale potentials.








Abstract
Compared with commonly used Zn foil anodes, Zn powder (ZP) anodes offer superior versatility and processability. However, in aqueous electrolytes, dendrite growth and side reactions, such as corrosion and hydrogen evolution, become more severe in ZP anodes than those in Zn foil anodes because of the rough surfaces and high surface areas of ZP, leading to poor reversibility and limitations in high‐loading mass cathodes. In this study, a diisocyanate‐polytetrahydrofuran‐dihydrazide polymer (DDP) binder is developed, inspired by protein structures. The strong Zn2+ adsorption capability of the binder effectively regulates Zn2+ flux, while its unique hydrogen‐bond arrays facilitate the formation of a free‐standing ZP anode and inhibit side reactions. The binder exhibits superior mechanical performance, providing ZP electrodes with excellent resistance to various mechanical stresses, including tensile, nanoindentation, scratch, and dynamic bending tests. ZP symmetric cells achieve stable cycling at capacities of 2 and 5 mAh cm−2. In addition, DDP functions as an iodine cathode, effectively mitigating the polyiodide shuttle effect. The fabricated ZP/DDP||I2/DDP full cells demonstrate an excellent rate capability and cycling stability, even under a high‐loading conditions. This study presents a novel approach for preparing stable ZP anodes and iodine cathodes, offering a promising strategy for large‐scale applications.

Rhodium‐carbon coordination‐based 2D metal‐organic frameworks are rationally synthesized and exhibit ultra‐narrow bandgaps (0.10–0.28 eV) and intrinsic charge mobilities up to 560 ± 46 cm2 V−1 s−1 via time‐resolved terahertz spectroscopy.








Abstract
2D metal‐organic frameworks (2D MOFs) are emerging organic van der Waals materials with great potential in various applications owing to their structural diversity, and tunable optoelectronic properties. So far, most reported 2D MOFs rely on metal‐heteroatom coordination (e.g., metal–nitrogen, metal–oxygen, and metal–sulfur); synthesis of metal‐carbon coordination based 2D MOFs remains a formidable challenge. This study reports the rhodium–carbon (Rh–C) coordination‐based 2D MOFs, using isocyanide as the ligand and Rh(I) as metal node. The synthesized MOFs show excellent crystallinity with quasi‐square lattice networks. These MOFs show ultra‐narrow bandgaps (0.1–0.28 eV) resulting from the interaction between Rh(I) and isocyano groups. Terahertz spectroscopy demonstrates exceptional short‐range charge mobilities up to 560 ± 46 cm2 V−1 s−1 in the as‐synthesized MOFs. Moreover, these MOFs are used as electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction and show an excellent NH3 yield rate of 56.0 ± 1.5 µg h−1 mgcat−1 and a record Faradaic efficiency of 87.1 ± 1.8%. In situ experiments reveal dual pathways involving Rh(I) during the catalytic process. This work represents a pioneering step toward 2D MOFs based on metal–carbon coordination and paves the way for novel reticular materials with ultra‐high carrier mobility and for versatile optoelectronic devices.

An electric power generating cell is developed based on potential difference driven reversible ion migration, which generates ultra‐long life electric output over 8‐month with a high short‐circuit of over 40 mA and output power density of up to 6 W m−2, surpassing the values reported for many other sorts of typical electricity generators.









Abstract
Sustainable energy supply without relying on external power sources is one of the bottlenecks in achieving self‐supportive wearable electronics and Internet‐of‐things (IoT) systems. Here a new type of universally applicable and ultra‐long life cyclic power generation is developed induced by interfacial redox reaction‐mediated ion‐oscillation, which can provide cycling electric energy in a self‐charging manner without extra pre‐charge. Based on asymmetric manganese dioxide and molybdenum disulfide electrode pairs, the proof‐concept electric potential difference power generating cell (EPDC) offers ultra‐long life electric output over 8‐month testing period for tens of thousands of cycles. A layer‐stacking EPDC unit supplies a high direct current of more than 40 mA and a power density of ≈6 W m−2. Such recyclable power‐generating process mainly relies on reversible ion migration at an asymmetric interface in response to relative variation of electric potentials. The universal applicability of EPDC is validated by a combination of diverse electrode pairs. Large‐scale manufacture of EPDCs is achievable by industry‐compatible auto‐blade coating technology with on‐demand power output, providing a long‐acting power supply platform for self‐charging electronic systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in the field of in vivo optical imaging due to their ability to effectively minimize the interference of fluorescence background from biological tissues. In this work, a bottom‐up strategy is proposed for preparing UOP nanocrystals with different crystal forms for in vivo biological imaging.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials are valuable for biological imaging to avoid interference from fluorescence background signals because of their delayed emission property. Obtaining nanocrystals with high phosphorescence quantum yield is a critical factor to achieve high‐quality UOP imaging. Herein, a pair of host–guest UOP doped system with variable crystal forms for the host is constructed. By exploring the relationship between the crystal form of the host and the UOP of the doped system, the importance of host crystal form is revealed to achieve high quantum yield UOP in doped systems. Furthermore, to overcome the low crystallinity and numerous defects faced by traditional bottom‐up strategies for nanocrystal preparation, a strategy is proposed for the selective preparation of nanocrystals with the target crystal form. Through controlling the evaporation rate of the solvent, the ordered growth of crystals can be effectively regulated to obtain nanocrystals with different crystal forms for bioimaging applications.

<title>Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202501946?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A chiral ground state of ferroelectric smectric is discovered which emerges in an achiral rod mesogen. This is not due to the torque‐driven effect on the surface. The research confirms that the polar smectric blocks are twisted despite its high elasticity. Such a structure is predominantly generated in molecules with larger dipole moments, smaller dipole angles, and smaller aspect ratios.








Abstract
In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left‐ or right‐handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer‐twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, two types of achiral molecules (BOE‐NO2 and DIOLT) are reported that possess different molecular structures but exhibit a NF–ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. It is demonstrated that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE‐NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work opens the avenue to molecular‐level modulation in organic precursors for developing high‐performance hard carbon in sodium‐ion batteries. The highly cross‐linked polymeric network in the precursor is constructed by unique molecular stitching strategy. The network evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices with abundant closed ultramicro‐pores (<0.3 nm), thereby enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters in hard carbon.








Abstract
High energy density of sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) requires high low‐voltage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency for hard carbon. However, simultaneously achieving both characteristics is a substantial challenge. Herein, a unique molecular stitching strategy is proposed to edit the polymeric structure of common starch for synthesizing cost‐effective hard carbon (STHC‐MS). A mild air‐heating treatment toward starch is employed to trigger the esterification reaction between carboxyl and hydroxy groups, which can effectively connect the branched polysaccharide chains thereby constructing a highly cross‐linked polymeric network. In contrast with the pristine branched‐chain starch, the cross‐linking structured precursor evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices creating a large population of closed ultramicro‐pores (<0.3 nm) enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters. Resultantly, STHC‐MS delivers a reversible capacity of 348 mAh g−1 with a remarkable low‐voltage (below 0.1 V) capacity of 294 mAh g−1, which becomes more attractive by combining the high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%. Moreover, STHC‐MS exhibits outstanding stability of 0.008% decay per cycle over 4800 cycles at 1 A g−1. STHC‐MS||Na3V2(PO3)4 full cells achieve an energy density of 266 Wh kg−1, largely surpassing the commercial hard carbon‐based counterpart. This work opens the avenue of molecular‐level modulation in organic precursors for developing high‐performance hard carbon in SIBs.

<title>Resolving Dynamic Behavior of Electrocatalysts via Advances of Operando X‐Ray Absorption Spectroscopies: Potential Artifacts and Practical Guidelines</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Resolving dynamically fine structure of electrocatalysts is realized by advanced X‐ray spectroscopies. Based on a case study of operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X‐ray irradiation are validated and it is identified whether the dynamic behaviors are electrochemical reaction related. A practical protocol is proposed for conducting reliable X‐ray spectroscopic measurements for accurate spectra interpretation.








Abstract
Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real‐time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid–liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high‐brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X‐ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X‐ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X‐ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X‐ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon‐flux density‐, dose‐, and time‐dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X‐ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X‐ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.

With merits of good solution processability, intrinsic flexibility, etc, organic/organic interconnecting layers (ICLs) are highly desirable for tandem organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, an n‐doped cross‐linked organic electron transport layer (ETL), named c‐NDI‐Br:PEI is developed, via a simple in situ quaternization reaction between bromopentyl‐substituted naphthalene diimide derivative (NDI‐Br) and polyethylenimine (PEI). Due to strong self‐doping, c‐NDI‐Br:PEI films exhibit a high electrical conductivity (0.06 S cm−1), which is important for efficient hole and electron reombination in ICL of tandem OPVs. In addition, the cross‐linked ETLs show strong work function modulation ability, and good solvent‐resistance. The above features enable c‐NDI‐Br:PEI to function as an efficient ETL not only for single‐junction OPVs, but also for tandem devices without any metal layer in ICL. Under solar radiation, the single‐junction device with c‐NDI‐Br:PEI as ETL achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.18%, surpassing the ZnO‐based device (17.09%). The homo‐ and hetero‐tandem devices with m‐PEDOT:PSS:c‐NDI‐Br:PEI as ICL exhibit remarkable PCEs of 19.06% and 20.06%, respectively. Under 808 nm laser radiation with a photon flux of 57 mW cm−2, the homo‐tandem device presents a superior PCE of 38.5%. This study provides a new ETL for constructing all‐solution‐processed organic/organic ICL, which can be integrated in flexible and wearable devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To concurrently improve activity and stability for seawater electrolysis under high current densities, the problems of firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles with core/shell nanoarrays, addressed which further regulates the interfacial H2O activity to reduce overpotentials, hence highlighting its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible application for large‐scale hydrogen production.








Abstract
The catalytic activity and stability under high current densities for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are impeded by firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles to the catalytic sites. Herein, we systematically synthesize core/shell nanoarrays to engineer bubble transport channels, which further remarkably regulate interfacial H2O activity, and swift H2 bubble generation and release. The self‐supported catalyst holds uniform ultra‐low Ru active sites of 0.38 wt% and promotes the rapid formation of plentiful small H2 bubbles, which are rapidly released by the upright channels, mitigating the blockage of active sites and avoiding surface damage from bubble movements. As a result, these core/shell nanoarrays achieve ultralow overpotentials of 18 and 24 mV to reach 10 mA cm−2 for HER in 1 M KOH freshwater and seawater, respectively. Additionally, the assembled electrolyzer demonstrates stable durability over 800 hours with a high current density of 2 A cm−2 in 1 M KOH seawater. The techno‐economic analysis (TEA) indicates that the unit cost of the hydrogen production system is nearly half of the DOE's (Department of Energy) 2026 target. Our work addresses the stability challenges of HER and highlights its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible solution for large‐scale hydrogen production of seawater.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An amplified sensing strategy is reported in the second near‐infrared long‐wavelength (NIR‐II‐L, 1500–1900 nm) window for non‐invasivel in situ visualization of early cancerization biomarker miRNA‐21, providing a promising alternative for early diagnosis of cancerization and a guidance for therapeutic management.








Abstract
Accurate, sensitive, and in situ visualization of aberrant expression level of low‐abundant biomolecules is crucial for early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection ahead of tumor morphology change. However, the clinical used colonoscopy and biopsy methods are invasive and lack of sensitivity at early‐stage of cancerization. Here, an amplified sensing strategy is developed in the second near‐infrared long‐wavelength subregion (NIR‐II‐L, 1500–1900 nm) by integrating DNAzyme‐triggered signal amplification technology and lanthanide‐dye hybrid system. In the early‐stage of CRC, the overexpressed biomarker microRNA‐21 initiates the NIR‐II‐L luminescence ratiometric signal amplification of the CRCsensor. The high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.26 pm allows non‐invasive visualization of orthotopic colorectal cancerization via rectal administration, which achieves early and accurate in situ diagnosis at 2 weeks ahead of the in vitro histological results. This innovative approach offers a promising tool for early diagnosis and long‐term monitoring of carcinogenesis progression, with potential applications in other cancer‐related biomarkers.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study explores 2D ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 for developing advanced NC‐FET technology. Using MoS2 as the channel material, NC‐FETs with optimized capacitance matching conditions achieve ultra‐steep subthreshold swings (12 mV dec−1) and negligible hysteresis. A resistor‐loaded inverter operating at 0.2 V with hysteresis‐free characteristics highlights the potential of engineered 2D ferroelectrics for next‐generation low‐power electronics.








Abstract
The relentless pursuit of miniaturization and reduced power consumption in information technology demands innovative device architectures. Negative capacitance field‐effect transistors (NC‐FETs) offer a promising solution by harnessing the negative capacitance effect of ferroelectric materials to amplify gate voltage and achieve steep subthreshold swings (SS). In this work, 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) is employed as the gate dielectric to realize hysteresis‐free NC‐FETs technology. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) is employed to investigate the dielectric property of CCPS, revealing a thickness‐independent dielectric constant of ≈35. Subsequently, NC‐FETs are fabricated with MoS2 channel, and the capacitance matching conditions are meticulously investigated. The optimized devices exhibit simultaneously ultra‐steep SS (≈12 mV dec−1) and negligible hysteresis, with immunity to both voltage scan range and scan rate. Finally, a resistor‐loaded inverter is demonstrated manifesting a low operation voltage down to 0.2 V and hysteresis‐free transfer characteristics. This work paves the way for the development of high‐performance, low‐power electronics by exploiting 2D vdW ferroelectric materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Combining in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging with machine learning‐based image analysis, this study directly visualizes and tracks dynamic restructuring in reducible oxide catalysts for green methanol synthesis. The findings reveal how supports modulate dynamic behaviors of reaction‐induced InOx species, underpinning the superior methanol productivity of the In2O3/m‐ZrO2 catalyst.








Abstract
Supported reducible oxides, such as indium oxide on monoclinic zirconia (In2O3/m‐ZrO2), are promising catalysts for green methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation. Growing evidence suggests that dynamic restructuring under reaction conditions plays a crucial but poorly understood role in catalytic performance. To address this, the direct visualization of the state‐of‐the‐art In2O3/m‐ZrO2 catalyst under CO2 hydrogenation conditions (T  =  553 K, P  =  1.9 bar, CO2:H2  =  1:4) is pioneered using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), comparing its behavior to In2O3 on supports with similar (tetragonal, t‐ZrO2 or anatase TiO2) or lower (LSm‐ZrO2) surface areas. Complementary in situ infrared spectroscopy and catalytic tests confirm methanol formation under equivalent conditions. A machine‐learning‐based difference imaging approach differentiates and ranks restructuring patterns, revealing that partially reduced InOx species on m‐ZrO2 undergo cyclic aggregation‐redispersion via atomic surface migration, maintaining high active phase dispersion. High‐resolution ex situ STEM analysis further shows the epitaxial formation of In2O3 mono‐ and bilayers on (100) m‐ZrO2 facets, highlighting strong oxide‐support interactions. In contrast, sintering prevails on t‐ZrO2, a‐TiO2, and low‐surface m‐ZrO2, correlating with lower methanol productivity. This work underscores the pivotal role of oxide‐support interfacial interactions in the reaction‐induced restructuring of InOx species and establishes a framework for tracking nanoscale catalyst dynamics.

<title>Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered Van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T‐TaS2 − xSex</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An intriguing metal was discovered in a chiral charge density wave material, 1T‐TaS2. The random substitution of S by Se induces a transition from an insulator to a metal with a strongly suppressed electron density at the Fermi energy. The pseudogap comes from electronic disorder on with substantial electron correlation and exhibits unprecedented chirality, which may induce exotic superconductivity. 








Abstract
The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T‐TaS2 is reported, through isoelectronic substitute of S. The evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T‐TaS2 − xSex (0 ⩽ x ⩽ 2) is systematically investigated using angle‐resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, the pseudogap phase is attributed to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent physics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work proposes an approach for the efficient generation of manifold acoustic holograms underwater by using high‐pixel‐array binary metasurfaces. Beyond generating simple‐pattern holograms, it is shown that increasing the pixel numbers within a single metasurface allows for the creation of 2D/3D complex holographic fields. Moreover, it is demonstrated that holograms at multiple depths or frequencies can be encoded within one metasurface, thereby enhancing its information capacity. This work holds significant potential for applications in fields such as biomedical imaging and non‐contact particle manipulation. 








Abstract
Acoustic holograms using artificial materials have become an area of intense interest in acoustics due to the great potential in various applications such as medical imaging, underwater detection and object manipulation, etc. In this article, a general approach is proposed for designing high‐pixel‐array binary metasurfaces and then fabricating the intricate ultrathin structures via picosecond laser processing for implementing high‐resolution manifold holograms in far fields. The angular spectrum propagation is utilized in combination with the forward optimization, instead of the Rayleigh‐Sommerfeld integral, to efficiently simulate far‐field holograms at the target plane. To obtain manifold acoustic holograms in the planes at different depths, zero‐padding is utilized to break the tight constraint of sampling theorem. Benefiting from the realizable high‐pixel‐array binary metasurface, e.g., the number of pixels ≈90 000 or even more, high‐resolution complicated holograms can be readily achieved. As an example, multi‐depth holography, multi‐frequency holography, and sophisticated holography are generated via binary metasurfaces. The functional meta‐devices based on ultrasound amplitude modulations provide more opportunities for exploring practical applications of acoustic metamaterials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Creating sulfur‐vacancy‐rich tungsten sulfide into composite polymer electrolyte enables homogeneous high‐throughput Li‐ion transport (ultra‐high ionic conductivity of 1.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C) and uniform lithium deposition (ultra‐long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li cells). The sulfurized polyacrylonitrile||Li solid pouch cell exhibits an initial discharge‐specific capacity of 1048 mAh g−1, resulting in a total capacity of 0.524 Ah.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid‐state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large‐scale processability and high safety. However, challenges remain, including limited ion transport and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which result in unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address these issues, a high‐throughput Li‐ion transport pathway is developed by incorporating tungsten sulfide enriched with sulfur vacancies (SVs) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride‐co‐hexafluoropropylene)‐based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). The SVs strong interaction in the CPEs facilitates homogeneous high‐throughput Li‐ion transport 1.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C) by enhancing the dissociation of lithium salts and effectively creates ample interfaces with the polymer chains to reduce the formation of inner vacuities. Moreover, the SVs confine FSI− anions, while the electron‐rich environment induced by sulfur atoms promotes the preferential degradation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions, ensuring uniform lithium deposition. This fosters the formation of inorganic nanocrystals on the lithium anode and effectively suppresses dendrite growth, enabling an ultra‐long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li symmetric cells. When paired with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a pouch cell capacity of 0.524 Ah is achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of a homogeneous, high‐throughput Li‐ions transport mechanism.

Strategically engineered Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets with high‐density grain boundaries exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. This design optimizes Ru‐Ir interactions and charge distribution, reducing overpotential to 189 mV for 10 mA cm−2 and maintaining stability for >1000 h at industrial‐scale current density. This advancement offers a pathway to efficient, cost‐effective green hydrogen production.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has long stood as a formidable challenge for green hydrogen sustainable production, hindered by sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials, and poor durability. Here, these barriers are transcended through a novel material design: strategic engineering of high‐density grain boundaries within solid‐solution Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets. These carefully tailored grain boundaries and synergistic Ir─Ru interactions, reduce the coordination of Ru atoms and optimize the distribution of charge, thereby enhancing both the catalytic activity and stability of the nanosheets, as verified by merely requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm−2 in acidic electrolyte. In situ electrochemical techniques, complemented by theoretical calculations, reveal that the OER follows an adsorption evolution mechanism, demonstrating the pivotal role of grain boundary engineering and electronic modulation in accelerating reaction kinetics. Most notably, the Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox exhibits outstanding industrial‐scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm−2 at 2 V and maintaining stability for >1000 h at 500 mA cm−2. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg−1. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In kagome lattice magnet Mn₃GaC, controllable multiple spin states with giant baro‐magnetoresistance effect, which can enhance magnetic storage, are achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin‐polarized plane through applied pressure. These multiple spin states originate from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization.








Abstract
Strongly correlated magnets, exhibiting distinctive spin properties such as spin‐orbit coupling, spin polarization, and chiral spin, are regarded as the next‐generation high‐density magnetic storage materials in spintronics. Nevertheless, owing to intricate spin interactions, realizing controllable spin arrangement and high‐density magnetic storage remains a formidable challenge. Here, controllable multiple spin states induced by the baromagnetic effect in kagome lattice magnet Mn₃GaC are first reported, achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin‐polarized plane employing pressure. Neutron diffraction refinement and specific heat measurements under pressure, combined with first‐principles calculations, demonstrate that multiple spin states are originating from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization related to the lifting of degeneracy in electronic microstates. Electrical transport measurements under pressure reveal that multiple spin states exhibit giant baro‐magnetoresistance effect, enabling enhanced storage density in spintronics via multi‐logic state applications. Integrating the pressure response and microscopic behaviors of spins, a comprehensive p‐T‐H phase diagram is constructed, offering a novel and robust framework for multi‐logic states. These findings provide critical insights into controllable spin states, opening a new avenue for high‐density magnetic storage through multiple spin states.

The piezoelectric SF film with visible periodic piezoelectric domains and excellent biocompatibility is fabricated through a feasible photochemical method with silver nanoparticles as the developer and mediator simultaneously. Consequently, the oriented piezoelectric electric field is achieved under ultrasound and effectively regulates the directional growth and length of neurite and neural gene expression.








Abstract
The development of visible periodic piezoelectric domains is highly attractive but challenging to overcome the homogeneous distribution and lack of visualization of the electric field on traditional piezopolymers. This work reports an in situ synthesis to create customized silver patterns with micron‐level distinguishability. This method serves to form visible periodic piezoelectric domains and endows the silk fibroin (SF) piezoelectric generator with maximum root mean square current, energy density, and voltage of 5.1 mA, 6.7 W m−2 and 529.5 mV, respectively, under an ultrasound intensity of 1.0 W cm−2. The oriented piezoelectric electric field is periodically distributed into the SF film with ultrasound‐driven assistance and remarkably regulates neurite directional growth, length, and gene expression. Additionally, these piezoelectric domains enable the direct and timely observation of the electric field's effect on neurites by biological microscopy. This approach paves the way for great potential in tailored electric stimulation for cell biology and medical engineering.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dynamic, dual‐network CGDE hydrogel, combining covalent and noncovalent crosslinking mimics the biochemical and mechanical cues of bone extracellular matrix. This viscoelastic matrix promotes 3D cellular self‐organization and drives the development of functional woven bone organoids (WBOs) through intramembranous ossification, reaching peak bioactivity at 21 days. This approach offers a robust and scalable platform for bone organoid engineering.








Abstract
Bone organoids, in vitro models mimicking native bone structure and function, rely on 3D stem cell culture for self‐organization, differentiation, ECM secretion, and biomineralization, ultimately forming mineralized collagen hierarchies. However, their development is often limited by the lack of suitable matrices with optimal mechanical properties for sustained cell growth and differentiation. To address this, a dynamic DNA/Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel (CGDE) is developed to recapitulate key biochemical and mechanical features of the bone ECM, providing a supportive microenvironment for bone organoid formation. This dual‐network hydrogel is engineered through hydrogen bonding between DNA and GelMA, combined with GelMA network crosslinking, resulting in appropriate mechanical strength and enhanced viscoelasticity. During a 21‐day 3D culture, the CGDE hydrogel facilitates cellular migration and self‐organization, promoting woven bone organoid (WBO) formation via intramembranous ossification. These WBOs exhibit spatiotemporal architectures supporting dynamic mineralization and tissue remodeling. In vivo studies demonstrate that CGDE‐derived WBOs exhibit self‐adaptive properties, enabling rapid osseointegration within 4 weeks. This work highlights the CGDE hydrogel as a robust and scalable platform for bone organoid development, offering new insights into bone biology and innovative strategies for bone tissue regeneration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A simple and effective approach to grain boundary growth optimization: Incorporating a KTFB polyfluorinated additive into the antisolvent to regulate grain boundary growth, eliminate excessive halide lead and defects, and form wide‐bandgap (1.78 eV) perovskite films with grain size over 2 µm, enabling the realization of efficient two‐terminal and four‐terminal all‐perovskite tandem devices.









Abstract
Tandem perovskite solar cells represent a significant avenue for the future development of perovskite photovoltaics. Despite their promise, wide‐bandgap perovskites, essential for constructing efficient tandem structures, have encountered formidable challenges. Notably, the high bromine content (>40%) in these 1.78 eV bandgap perovskites triggers rapid crystallization, complicating the control of grain boundary growth and leading to films with smaller grain sizes and higher defect density than those with narrower bandgaps. To address this, potassium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate molecules are incorporated into the antisolvent, employing a crystallographic orientation‐tailored strategy to optimize grain boundary growth, thereby achieving wide‐bandgap perovskite films with grains exceeding 2 µm and effectively eliminating surplus lead halide and defects at the grain boundaries. As a result, remarkable efficiency is achieved in single‐junction wide‐bandgap perovskite devices, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.7%, and in all‐perovskite tandem devices, with a two‐terminal PCE of 28.3% and a four‐terminal PCE of 29.1%, which all rank among the highest reported values in the literature. Moreover, the stability of these devices has been markedly improved. These findings offer a novel perspective for driving further advancements in the perovskite solar cell domain.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A typical paradigm to utilize hetero‐trimetallic atom catalysts (CCF TACs@NVs) with a stable symmetrical pyramid structure for catalytic guided apoptosis and ferroptosis‐induced cell death, which is provided by the multi‐enzymes like abilities under effective tumor aggregation, highlighting the application prospects in the biomedical field.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in cellular metabolic processes by acting as primary intracellular chemical substrates and secondary messengers for cellular signal modulation. However, the artificial engineering of nanozymes to generate ROS is restricted by their low catalytic efficiency, high toxicity, and off‐target consumption. Herein, hetero‐trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) anchored on a stable symmetrical pyramid structure are designed in the presence of N and P surface ligands from cross‐linked polyphosphazene interlayer‐coated MIL‐101(Fe). The 3D network TACs with a uniform dispersion of Cu, Co, and Fe hetero‐single atoms effectively tailor the active sites to avoid metal sintering, thereby providing sufficient catalytic activity for ROS blooms. Nanovesicle membranes facilitate the stable accumulation of nanozymes with homologous targeting, recognition, and endocytosis, effectively addressing the potentially high toxicity and off‐target defects. Therefore, the outcome of the in situ ROS‐bloom acts as a redox signal for directly regulating oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, ROS intervene in the glutathione peroxidase 4, long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthetase 4, and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase‐3 pathways as second messengers, fostering the proclivity toward apoptosis and lipid peroxidation‐regulated ferroptosis pathway concurrently, thereby highlighting the application prospects of TACs in the biomedical field.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The CeO2‐x‐suspension electrolyte is initially proposed to regulate the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure and alters the inner Helmholtz plane to accelerate Zn[(H2O)6]2+ desolvation, achieving a homogenized electric field and uniform ion flux kinetics. Consequently, the suspen sion electrolyte achieves a service life exceeding 6500 h at 0 °C and demonstrates outstanding rate performance at −20 °C, highlighting its practical potential for AZMBs.








Abstract
The conventional electrolyte for rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) breeds many problems such as Zn dendrite growth and side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, which are fundamentally attributed to the uneven ion flux owing to the high barriers of desolvation and diffusion of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ clusters. Herein, to modulate the [Zn(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure, the suspension electrolyte engineering employed with electron‐delocalized catalytic nanoparticles is initially proposed to expedite desolvation kinetics. As a proof, the electron‐density‐adjustable CeO2‐x is introduced into the commercial electrolyte and preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, regulating the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ structure. Meanwhile, the defect‐rich CeO2‐x redistributes the localized space electric field to uniformize ion flux kinetics and inhibits dendrite growth, as confirmed by a series of theoretical simulations, spectroscopical and experimental measurements. Encouragingly, the CeO2‐x decorated suspension electrolyte enables a long stability over 1200 cycles at 5 mA cm−2 and an extended lifespan exceeding 6500 h with lower overpotentials of 34 mV under 0 °C. Matched with polyaniline cathodes, the full cells with suspension electrolyte exhibit a capacity‐retention of 96.75% at 1 A g−1 under −20 °C as well as a long lifespan of up to 400 cycles in a large‐areal pouch cell, showcasing promising potentials of suspension electrolyte for practical AZMBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An eye‐drop nano‐formulation of catalase self‐assembled with cysteine‐modified chitosan is designed. The obtained nanoparticles after eye‐drop administration could form disulfide bonds with the mucin layer of the team film to achieve enhanced precorneal adhesion, so as to continuously eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species accumulated in the ocular surface to suppress inflammation, resulting in effective treatment of dry eye disease.








Abstract
Dry eye disease (DED), the most prevalent ophthalmological condition worldwide, can cause severe ocular discomfort and even visual impairment. Effective yet safe therapeutics for severe DED are still highly demanded. Herein, considering the important role of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in triggering DED, an eye‐drop nano‐formulation of catalase (CAT) self‐assembled with cysteine‐modified chitosan (CS‐Cys) is designed for DED treatment. Upon eye‐drop administration of CS‐Cys/CAT nanoparticles, CS‐Cys can form disulfide bonds with abundant thiols in the mucin layer of the tear film, anchoring catalase to the corneal surface. Thus the excess ROS accumulated on the ocular surface can be effectively eliminated, resulting in a regulated tear microenvironment. In mouse and rabbit models, it is verified that CS‐Cys/CAT eye drops can offer excellent therapeutic effects, especially in promoting the recovery of damaged epithelium and increasing tear secretion. Remarkably, CS‐Cys/CAT eye drops showed notably better therapeutic performance than clinically used cyclosporin and dexamethasone, as well as several new DED drugs in clinical trials. Thus, the work presents a unique nanoparticulate eye‐drop‐based ocular delivery system to allow prolonged ocular retention of protein therapeutics, and such nanoformulation formulated by fully biocompatible/biodegradable components possesses significant translational potential for effective and safe DED treatment.

<title>Improved Facet and Edge Passivation in Near‐Infrared III‐V Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419020?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Increasing InAs CQD size exposes diverse facets and edges, bringing challenges for effective passivation. This work introduces a mixed‐halide passivation strategy to stabilize these facets and edges, doubling anti‐oxidation ability and boosting mobility. The resulting photodetectors achieve 75% EQE, 10 ns response time, and 50 h operational stability (10% loss) at 1140 nm, advancing InAs CQD photodetector performance.








Abstract
Lead‐free III‐V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of significant interest for their potential in near‐infrared (NIR) to short‐wave infrared (SWIR) photodetection. However, achieving effective surface passivation remains challenging, especially as larger CQD sizes introduce more complex surface facets and compositions while shifting the absorption peak from the NIR to the SWIR range. In this study, a mixed‐halide passivation strategy is developed for large InAs CQDs, an approach that led to a doubling in anti‐oxidation ability and achieves a hole mobility of 0.03 cm2 Vs−1. These in turn led to a T90 lifetime of 50 h and enhanced operating stability in photodetectors operating at 1140 nm. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and facet characterization indicate that exposed facets and edges are well passivated using a mixture of indium halides, which provide a stronger desorption energy compared to single‐halide passivation. This approach yields photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 75% and a response time of 10 ns, an advance for InAs photodetectors operating at 1140 nm.

<title>Ir/Mn Co‐Mixing and Oxide‐Support Interaction Modulation Through Plasma Promoted Asymmetric Oxygen Coupling for Stable Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202420159?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202420159?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co‐mixing and the strong oxide‐support interaction modulation through plasma defect engineering is used for the development of the catalysts that follow the oxide path mechanism for the oxygen‐evolution reaction (OER). The obtained catalyst shows exceptional OER activity and remarkable stability in the acid media.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable catalysts that facilitate the oxygen‐evolution reaction (OER) through an oxide‐path mechanism (OPM) is of considerable interest. However, it remains a significant challenge due to the stringent structural requirements of these catalysts. This work reports that using a strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co‐mixing and the strong oxide‐support interaction (SOSI) modulation, efficient and stable Ir‐based catalysts that follow the OPM for the acidic OER can be developed. The strategy mainly relies on optimizing the distance of oxygeneous intermediate adsorption sites by the Ir/Mn co‐mixing and modulating the SOSI of the catalysts through plasma defect engineering to trigger the OPM pathway with a lower energy barrier. The density‐functional‐theory (DFT) calculations reveal a strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn via the Ir─O─Mn bond and a ready coupling of oxygeneous adsorbed on the Ir site with those on the Mn site, leading to an asymmetric oxygen coupling for the OER. The developed catalyst merely requires an overpotential of 240 mV to drive 10 mA cm−2 with the Ir mass‐activity > 75 times higher than that of the IrO2. When used in the proton‐exchange‐membrane water‐electrolyzers, it shows high performance and excellent stability at an industrial‐level current density of 1.0 A cm−2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The sluggish water‐splitting step hinders the advancement of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the design of efficient water‐splitting active sites critical. The MgOx and MoOy on the atomically thin Ru metallene can cooperatively promote the adsorption–dissociation of water molecules, greatly promoting the efficiency of alkaline HER.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgOx and MoOy species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one‐pot salt‐templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgOx and MoOy species on Ru metallene (MgOx/MoOy‐Ru) show a 15.3‐fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100 mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. It is further demonstrated that the MgOx/MoOy‐Ru‐based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55 V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60 h at a current density of 500 mA cm−2. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co‐introduction of MgOx and MoOy enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.

<title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Isolated Weakly Confined Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202500846?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202500846?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Efficiency and scintillation velocity are critical for high‐energy and medical physics. These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast‐timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.








Abstract
Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time‐of‐flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non‐radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420 ps lifetime and light yield of ≈10 000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non‐radiative losses. Temperature‐dependent light‐guiding experiments on test‐bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light‐transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band‐edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Atomic layer modulation is instrumental in optimizing catalytic kinetics for obtaining highly active photocatalysts. A precise atomic layer regulation strategy is proposed to realize the individual modulation of the surface In–S layer in ZnIn2S4, which creates deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d–S 3p to optimize H* adsorption/desorption and maximize surface catalytic benefits for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Solar‐driven hydrogen production is significant for achieving carbon neutrality but is limited by unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Layer regulation can impact carrier transmission or catalytic behavior, but the specific effects on the oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction (OER or HER) remain unclear, and atomic layer level modulation for maxing HER is challenging. Here the distinct roles of modulated Zn–S or In–S surface layers in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for the OER and HER, respectively, are disentangled. Moreover, the extensive characterizations and computational results demonstrate that stressful environments enable individual modulation and introduce Ni into the surface In–S layer rather than the easily alterable Zn–S layer, creating deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d–S 3p, optimizing H* adsorption/desorption, and maximizing surface catalytic benefits for the HER. Consequently, the optimized ZIS exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of up to 18.19 mmol g−1 h−1, ≈32 times higher than pristine ZIS. This investigation expands the application scenarios of ultrasonic technology and inspires other precise control types, such as defects and crystal plane engineering, etc.

The schematic representation highlights the essential components for developing a 3D bioprinted glioblastoma model. It includes key microenvironmental factors, biomaterials, and crosslinking techniques. The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM‐on‐a‐chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality‐by‐Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.









Abstract
Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post‐diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models. It encompasses an analysis of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with crosslinking methods to improve structural integrity. Also, it critically evaluates current 3D bioprinted GBM models and their integration into GBM‐on‐a‐chip platforms, which hold noteworthy potential for drug screening and personalized therapies. A versatile development framework grounded on Quality‐by‐Design principles is proposed to guide the design of bioprinting models. Future perspectives, including 4D bioprinting and machine learning approaches, are discussed, along with the current gaps to advance the field further.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The application of 2D perovskite materials in indoor photovoltaic field is studied. By constructing DJ/RP perovskite heterojunction, an optimal balance between defect passivation and carrier transport is achieved. Ultimately, the 2D PSCs attain a PCE of 30.30%, with working stability improved by a factor of 20 compared to 3D PSCs, demonstrating their significant potential in future indoor photovoltaic technology.








Abstract
2D perovskite materials are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, and enhanced stability. However, attaining uniform crystallization and overcoming low carrier mobility remain key challenges for 2D perovskites, limiting their overall performance. In this study, a 2D perovskite light‐absorbing layer is constructed using a Dion–Jacobson (DJ)‐phase EDA(FA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) and introduced butylammonium iodide (BAI) for interface modification, thereby creating a novel DJ/Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) dual 2D perovskite heterostructure. By adjusting the thickness of the BAI‐based perovskite layer, the relationship between interfacial defect states and carrier mobility is investigated under varying indoor light intensities. The results indicate that, by achieving a balance between interfacial defect passivation and carrier transport, the optimized 2D perovskite device reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 30.30% and an open‐circuit voltage (VOC) of 936 mV under 1000 lux (3000 K LED). 2D‐DJ/RP perovskite IPV exhibits a twentyfold increase in T90 lifetime compared to 3D perovskite devices. It is the first time to systematically study 2D perovskites in IPV applications, demonstrating that rationally designed and optimized 2D perovskites hold significant potential for fabricating high‐performance indoor PSCs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study reports the discovery of a stable γ‐phase in Cu6Te3‐xS1+x, achieving high thermoelectric performance with a Seebeck coefficient up to 200 µVK⁻¹ and ultralow thermal conductivity (≈0.25 Wm⁻¹K⁻¹). The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a zT of ≈1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost‐effective, eco‐friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.








Abstract
Copper‐based chalcogenides are cost‐effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu2X (X = S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new γ‐phase of Cu6Te3‐xS1+x (0 < x ≤ 1) is discovered, a narrow‐bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu6Te3S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The γ‐phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200 µVK−1 compared to 8.8 µVK−1 for Cu6Te3S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu6Te3‐xS1+x materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (≈0.25 Wm−1K−1), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high zT of ≈1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500 K. Unlike most Cu‐based chalcogenides, the γ‐phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost‐effective and eco‐friendly alternative to Bi2Te3‐based materials. The developed Cu6Te3‐xS1+x is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.

Systematic analysis of morphology‐dependent effects underscores opportunities for optimizing AM utilization and establishing morphology‐driven innovation frameworks in biomedicine.








Abstract
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have attracted increasing attention. Although significant efforts have been made to explore AMs with various morphologies, their full potential is yet to be realized, as most studies have primarily focused on materials or fabrication methods. A thorough analysis of the interactional and interdependent relationships between these factors is required, along with proposed countermeasures tailored for researchers from various backgrounds.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A full‐scale field‐free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin‐orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type‐II Dirac semimetal, Pt3Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt3Sn (111) surface with a z‐polarized spin component. This study positions the Dirac semimetals, such as Pt3Sn, as promising spin sources for integration into advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin‐orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next‐generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT‐driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field‐free switching through out‐of‐plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate z‐polarized spins with high charge‐to‐spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large‐scale production. This study demonstrates field‐free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type‐II Dirac semimetal Pt3Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with C3v symmetry, leading to significant z‐polarized spin accumulation in the Pt3Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt3Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low‐power, high‐density spintronic memory and logic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces a multimodal nonlinear microscopy approach using upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) under continuous‐wave excitation. The UCNPs exhibit high‐order nonlinear optical responses, enabling deep‐tissue 3D imaging, video‐rate wide‐field imaging, and depth‐selective photomodulation. High‐resolution in vivo imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks is demonstrated, highlighting the potential for cost‐effective bioimaging and targeted phototherapy applications.








Abstract
Nonlinear microscopy provides excellent depth penetration and axial sectioning for 3D imaging, yet widespread adoption is limited by reliance on expensive ultrafast pulsed lasers. This work circumvents such limitations by employing rare‐earth doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs), specifically Yb3+/Tm3+ co‐doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, which exhibit strong multimodal nonlinear optical responses under continuous‐wave (CW) excitation. These UCNPs emit multiple wavelengths at UV (λ ≈ 450 nm), blue (λ ≈ 450 nm), and NIR (λ ≈ 800 nm), whose intensities are nonlinearly governed by excitation power. Exploiting these properties, multi‐colored nonlinear emissions enable functional imaging of cerebral blood vessels in deep brain. Using a simple optical setup, high resolution in vivo 3D imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks at depths up to 800 µmm is achieved, surpassing performance of conventional imaging methods using CW lasers. In vivo cerebrovascular flow dynamics is also visualized with wide‐field video‐rate imaging under low‐powered CW excitation. Furthermore, UCNPs enable depth‐selective, 3D‐localized photo‐modulation through turbid media, presenting spatiotemporally targeted light beacons. This innovative approach, leveraging UCNPs' intrinsic nonlinear optical characteristics, significantly advances multimodal nonlinear microscopy with CW lasers, opening new opportunities in bio‐imaging, remote optogenetics, and photodynamic therapy.

A finger‐shaped tactile sensor inspired by human fingers is developed, capable of simultaneous normal and shear force detection and 98.33% accurate material identification. Integrated into a robot hand and arm system, it enables real‐time detection of gripping force, material identification, advancing haptic sensing in robotics.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile perception is crucial for advancing human–computer interaction, but real‐time multidimensional force detection and material identification remain challenging. Here, a finger‐shaped tactile sensor (FTS) based on the triboelectric effect is proposed, capable of multidirectional force sensing and material identification. The FTS is composed of an external material identification section and an internal force sensing section. Three materials are embedded into the surface of the silicone shell in the fingerpad, forming single‐electrode sensors for material identification. In the force sensing section, the silicone shell's outer surface is coated with conductive silver paste as a shielding layer. The inner wall has four silicone microneedle arrays and a silicone bump, while five silver electrodes are coated on the internal polylactic acid skeleton. The components connect via interlocking structures near the fingernail, allowing localized contact and separation between the silicone shell and skeleton, enabling force direction detection through signals from the five electrodes. Additionally, the outer sensors achieve 98.33% accuracy in recognizing 12 materials. Furthermore, integrated into a robotic hand, the FTS enables real‐time material identification and force detection in an intelligent sorting environment. This research holds great potential for applications in tactile perception for intelligent robotics.

A functionalized photochromic material based on spiro‐indoline naphthoxazine is applied to halide perovskite materials and the corresponding solar cells, demonstrating photoinduced transformation by a combination of techniques. This results in improvements in photovoltaic performances and operational stabilities, highlighting the potential of dynamic photochromic strategies in photovoltaics.








Abstract
The application of perovskite photovoltaics is hampered by issues related to the operational stability upon exposure to external stimuli, such as voltage bias and light. The dynamic control of the properties of perovskite materials in response to light could ensure the durability of perovskite solar cells, which is especially critical at the interface with charge‐extraction layers. We have applied a functionalized photochromic material based on spiro‐indoline naphthoxazine at the interface with hole‐transport layers in the corresponding perovskite solar cells with the aim of stabilizing them in response to voltage bias and light. We demonstrate photoinduced transformation by a combination of techniques, including transient absorption spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. As a result, the application of the photochromic derivative offers improvements in photovoltaic performance and operational stability, highlighting the potential of dynamic photochromic strategies in perovskite photovoltaics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Two regioisomeric COFs incorporating the thieno[3,2‐b]thiophene moiety are synthesized for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The β‐isomer exhibits exceptional performance compared to the α‐isomeric counterpart due to optimized electron distribution, enhance charge transfer efficiency, and precise alignment of excited‐state electrons with the ORR active site, demonstrating the great potential of leveraging regioisomerism in COF design.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a transformative platform for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production due to their highly ordered structures, intrinsic porosity, and molecular tunability. Despite their potential, the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers in COFs significantly restrains their photocatalytic efficiency. This study presents two regioisomeric COFs, α‐TT‐TDAN COF and β‐TT‐TDAN COF, both incorporating thieno[3,2‐b]thiophene moieties, to investigate the influence of regioisomerism on the excited electron distribution and its impact on photocatalytic performance. The β‐TT‐TDAN COF demonstrates a remarkable solar‐to‐chemical conversion efficiency of 1.35%, outperforming its α‐isomeric counterpart, which is merely 0.44%. Comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations reveal the critical role of subtle substitution change in COFs on their electronic properties. This structural adjustment intricately connects molecular structure to charge dynamics, enabling precise regulation of electron distribution, efficient charge separation and transport, and localization of excited electrons at active sites. Moreover, this finely tuned interplay significantly enhances the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. These findings establish a new paradigm in COF design, offering a molecular‐level strategy to advance COFs and reticular materials toward highly efficient solar‐to‐chemical energy conversion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents RuNPs‐RuCrAPs‐N‐C, a novel electrocatalyst incorporating Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs), single atoms, and Ru–Cr atomic pairs (RuCrAps) on nitrogen‐doped carbon, exhibiting exceptional alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. RuCrAPs modify the electronic structure of RuNPs as active sites through the optimised electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) and enhanced water adsorption and dissociation.








Abstract
Precisely optimizing the electronic metal support interaction (EMSI) of the electrocatalysts and tuning the electronic structures of active sites are crucial for accelerating water adsorption and dissociation kinetics in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, an effective strategy is applied to modify the electronic structure of Ru nanoparticles (RuNPs) by incorporating Ru single atoms (RuSAs) and Ru and Cr atomic pairs (RuCrAPs) onto a nitrogen‐doped carbon (N–C) support through optimized EMSI. The resulting catalyst, RuNPs‐RuCrAPs‐N‐C, shows exceptional performance for alkaline HER, achieving a six times higher turnover frequency (TOF) of 13.15 s⁻¹ at an overpotential of 100 mV, compared to that of commercial Pt/C (2.07 s⁻¹). Additionally, the catalyst operates at a lower overpotential at a current density of 10 mA·cm⁻2 (η10 = 31 mV), outperforming commercial Pt/C (η10 = 34 mV). Experimental results confirm that the RuCrAPs modified RuNPs are the main active sites for the alkaline HER, facilitating the rate‐determining steps of water adsorption and dissociation. Moreover, the Ru–Cr interaction also plays a vital role in modulating hydrogen desorption. This study presents a synergistic approach by rationally combining single atoms, atomic pairs, and nanoparticles with optimized EMSI effects to advance the development of efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline HER.

<title>Operando Magnetism on Oxygen Redox Process in Li‐Rich Cathodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In situ magnetism measurement is employed to investigate the magnetic/electronic structure evolution in the Li‐rich cathode. The magnetization changes demonstrate that charge storage behavior originates from synergistic transition metal spin‐state variation and π‐to‐σ interaction evolution, and further elucidate the internal origin of capacity decay during cycling. The Mn─O orbital model provides potential criteria for oxygen redox, guiding rational design of anionic redox‐based cathodes.








Abstract
Oxide ions in lithium‐rich layered oxides can store charge at high voltage and offer a viable route toward the higher energy density batteries. However, the underlying oxygen redox mechanism in such materials still remains elusive at present. In this work, a precise in situ magnetism measurement is employed to monitor real‐time magnetization variation associated with unpaired electrons in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 cathode material, enabling the investigation on magnetic/electronic structure evolution in electrochemical cycling. The magnetization gradually decreases except for a weak upturn above 4.6 V during the initial charging process. According to the comprehensive analyses of various in/ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the magnetization rebound can be attributed to the interaction evolution of lattice oxygen from π‐type delocalized Mn─O coupling to σ‐type O─O dimerization bonding. Moreover, the magnetization amplitude attenuation after long‐term cycles provides important evidence for the irreversible structure transition and capacity fading. The oxygen redox mechanism concluded by in situ magnetism characterization can be generalized to other electrode materials with an anionic redox process and provide pivotal guidance for designing advanced high‐performance cathode materials.

This work proposed an efficient Yb3+‐doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D‐LMHPs) film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super‐stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained. These findings will expand the optical properties and application potential of quasi 2D‐LMHPs materials.








Abstract
Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D‐LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4fn inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb3+‐doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D‐LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb3+ ions in the quasi 2D‐LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb3+ ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi‐channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br‐based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near‐infrared light‐emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990 nm and the record lifetime of 1274 min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D‐LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D‐LMHPs materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Artificial antiferromagnetically coupled multilayered heterostructures with tailored interlayer exchange interactions and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy hold great promise for applications such as magnetic random‐access memory, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. Voltage‐driven ion migration (i.e., magneto‐ionics) enables post‐synthesis tuning of these magnetic stacks, allowing significant modulation of the various switching events and transitions between antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) states.








Abstract
Voltage‐driven ion motion offers a powerful means to modulate magnetism and spin phenomena in solids, a process known as magneto‐ionics, which holds great promise for developing energy‐efficient next‐generation micro‐ and nano‐electronic devices. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin non‐magnetic spacer, offer advantages such as enhanced thermal stability, robustness against external magnetic fields, and reduced magnetostatic interactions in magnetic tunnel junctions. Despite its technological potential, magneto‐ionic control of antiferromagnetic coupling in multilayers (MLs) has only recently been explored and remains poorly understood, particularly in systems free of platinum‐group metals. In this work, room‐temperature voltage control of Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) interactions in Co/Ni‐based SAFs is achieved. Transitions between ferrimagnetic (uncompensated) and antiferromagnetic (fully compensated) states is observed, as well as significant modulation of the RKKY bias field offset, emergence of additional switching events, and formation of skyrmion‐like or pinned domain bubbles under relatively low gating voltages. These phenomena are attributed to voltage‐driven oxygen migration in the MLs, as confirmed through microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. This study underscores the potential of voltage‐triggered ion migration as a versatile tool for post‐synthesis tuning of magnetic multilayers, with potential applications in magnetic‐field sensing, energy‐efficient memories and spintronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study fabricates a large‐area multicolor rare‐earth afterglow film via electrospinning, integrating ZnS and tricolor rare‐earth phosphors to achieve ultra‐long afterglow (>30 h) and tunable emissions. The film exhibits thermoluminescence, environmental stability, and light‐capturing capabilities, enabling applications in fire‐rescue gear, greenhouses, and energy‐efficient tunnel/garage lighting. Its scalable production and cost‐effectiveness advance energy‐saving technologies in agriculture, safety, and urban infrastructure.








Abstract
Rare‐earth afterglow materials, with their unique light‐storage properties, show great promise for diverse applications. However, their broader applicability is constrained by challenges such as poor solvent compatibility, limited luminescent efficiency, and monochromatic emissions. In this study, these limitations are addressed by blending ZnS with various rare‐earth phosphors including (Sr0.75Ca0.25)S:Eu2+; SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+ and Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+, Dy3+ to modulate deep trap mechanisms and significantly enhance both the afterglow and light capture capabilities. Using electrospinning, a large‐area (0.4 m × 3 m) afterglow film is successfully fabricated with tunable colors and an extended afterglow duration exceeding 30 h. This film demonstrates thermoluminescence, enabling potential integration into fire‐rescue protective clothing for enhanced emergency visibility. In greenhouse settings, it effectively supports chlorophyll synthesis and optimizes conditions for plant growth over a 24‐h cycle. For tunnel and garage applications, the film captures and stores light from vehicle headlights at distances of up to 70 meters. The scalability and cost‐effectiveness of this afterglow film underscore its considerable potential for real‐world applications across multiple fields, marking a significant advancement in sustainable illumination technology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A natural binary electrolyte additive is designed to achieve an enhanced interfacial molecule adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double‐layer structure. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase is constructed for dendrite‐free Zn plating. The zinc ion hybrid capacitor with binary additive demonstrates an exceptional lifespan of over 100 000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) face challenges due to the limited interface stability of Zn anode, which includes uncontrolled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excessive dendrite growth. In this study, a natural binary additive composed of saponin and anisaldehyde is introduced to create a stable interfacial adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double layer (EDL) structure. Saponin with rich hydroxyl and carboxyl groups serves as “anchor points”, promoting the adsorption of anisaldehyde through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, anisaldehyde, with a unique aldehyde group, enhances HER suppression by preferentially facilitating electrocatalytic coupling with H* in the EDL, leading to the formation of a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase that prevents dendrite formation, and structural evolution of anisaldehyde during Zn deposition process is verified. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cells present an ultra‐long cycling lifespan of 3 400 h at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 700 h at 10 mA cm−2. Even at the current density of 20 mA cm−2, the cells demonstrate reversible operations for 450 h. Furthermore, Zn‐ion hybrid capacitors exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 100 000 cycles. This work presents a simple synergetic strategy to enhance anode/electrolyte interfacial stability, highlighting its potential for Zn anode protection in high‐performance AZIBs.

<title>CNT‐Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round‐Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
RuNi composites are constructed on surface‐functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for both alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The exceptional catalytic activity and multifunctionality of the catalyst composites across all key reactions enable a regenerative fuel cell system to achieve high round‐trip efficiency at industrial‐level current densities.








Abstract
Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large‐scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost‐effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)‐supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64 V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm−2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52 V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round‐trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.

<title>Achieving a Record Photoluminescence Quantum Yield in Green Light‐Emitting Carbon‐Centered Radicals with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Carbon‐centered radicals derived from N‐heterocyclic carbene, which exhibit hybrid local and charge transfer states, can inhibit the nonradiative channels and open the radiative channels, thereby achieving a record photoluminescence quantum yield with a nanosecond lifetime in green light‐emitting carbon‐centered radicals. This work may open new avenues for designing high‐efficiency doublet emitters in the green range.








Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals possess considerable potential for applications in organic light‐emitting diodes (OLEDs)‐based visible light communication owing to their intrinsic advantages of nanosecond emission lifetimes and spin‐allowed radiative transitions. However, the inherently narrow energy bandgap and multiple nonradiative channels of organic radicals make it difficult to achieve efficient green and blue light‐emitting, which is not conducive to applying visible light communication in diverse fields. In this study, a series of carbon‐centered radicals derived from N‐heterocyclic carbenes are designed and synthesized, some of which exhibiting hybrid local and charge‐transfer (HLCT) states that resulting in efficient green emission. The results of photophysical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the luminescence efficiency is closely related to their emission states. This relationship inhibits the nonradiative channels while simultaneously opening the radiative channels of organic radicals exhibiting HLCT states but not those with locally excited states. Intriguingly, a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of up to 70.1% at 534 nm is observed, which is the highest among green light‐emitting carbon‐centered radicals reported to date. Based on this exceptional result, an OLED device is fabricated and achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.8%. These results demonstrate its potential application in electroluminescent devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A gas sensor capable of monitoring acetylene in situ in a fluidic medium with high sensitivity, selectivity, rapid response, and long stability is developed using carbon nanotube‐embedded polyimide. The sensor, with a built‐in carbon‐nanotube‐based heater, maintains the optimal temperature for maximum performance in transformer oil even under severe mechanical stress, ensuring commercial‐standard durability.








Abstract
This study presents an acetylene gas sensor capable of in situ monitoring transformer oils. This sensor utilizes carbon nanotubes (CNTs) embedded in polyimide (PI) synthesized by floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition. Unlike conventional sensors that target hydrocarbon gases dissolved in oil and measure the gas extracted from the oil, the proposed CNT‐PI sensor detects gas within the oil in real time. The PI embedding technique effectively anchors and shields the CNT network against fluidic damage, ensuring stable sensing performance over 6 months, even under friction stress caused by oil convection. Decorating CNTs with gold nanoparticles further enhances the sensitivity and response of the sensor. The sensor achieves a high response (10.5% at 30 ppm) and fast response/recovery times (28 s/77 s), Furthermore, the sensor demonstrates good response (10.4% at 30 ppm) and moderate response/recovery times (444 s/670 s) in an oil medium, which qualifies for industrial applications. Additionally, a CNT‐PI‐based heater is integrated into the sensor as a multilayer component, maintaining an optimal operating temperature of 90 °C. The CNT‐PI sensor demonstrates consistent gas‐sensing performance even after 10,000 bending cycles and exhibits superior characteristics, indicating its compatibility with various forms of transformers.

Anode‐free all solid‐state batteries employ “empty” current collector with three active interfaces that determine electrochemical stability; lithium metal ‐ SE interphase (SEI‐1), lithium ‐ current collector interface, and collector ‐ SE interphase (SEI‐2). Bilayer of 140 nm magnesium/30 nm tungsten (Mg/W–Cu) controls the three interfaces and allows for state‐of‐the‐art electrochemical performance in half‐cells and full cells.








Abstract
Anode‐free all solid‐state batteries (AF‐ASSBs) employ “empty” current collector with three active interfaces that determine electrochemical stability; lithium metal – Solid electrolyte (SE) interphase (SEI‐1), lithium – current collector interface, and collector – SE interphase (SEI‐2). Argyrodite Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) solid electrolyte (SE) displays SEI‐2 containing copper sulfides, formed even at open circuit. Bilayer of 140 nm magnesium/30 nm tungsten (Mg/W‐Cu) controls the three interfaces and allows for state‐of‐the‐art electrochemical performance in half‐cells and fullcells. AF‐ASSB with NMC811 cathode achieves 150 cycles with Coulombic efficiency (CE) above 99.8%. With high mass‐loading cathode (8.6 mAh cm−2), AF‐ASSB retains 86.5% capacity after 45 cycles at 0.2C. During electrodeposition of Li, gradient Li‐Mg solid solution is formed, which reverses upon electrodissolution. This promotes conformal wetting/dewetting by Li and stabilizes SEI‐1 by lowering thermodynamic driving force for SE reduction. Inert refractory W underlayer is required to prevent ongoing formation of SEI‐2 that also drives electrochemical degradation. Inert Mo and Nb layers likewise protect Cu from corroding, while Li‐alloying layers (Mg, Sn) are less effective due to ongoing volume changes and associated pulverization. Mechanistic explanation for observed Li segregation within alloying LixMg layer is provided through mesoscale modelling, considering opposing roles of diffusivity differences and interfacial stresses.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated every aspect of science, including polymer research. Researchers from both fields need to collaborate to understand the challenges and opportunities of each domain. This review is therefore written by mathematicians and polymer chemists to highlight the key research questions polymer chemists aim to address and how machine learning can assist in answering them.








Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly being applied in polymer chemistry to link chemical structures to macroscopic properties of polymers and to identify chemical patterns in the polymer structures that help improve specific properties. To facilitate this, a chemical dataset needs to be translated into machine readable descriptors. However, limited and inadequately curated datasets, broad molecular weight distributions, and irregular polymer configurations pose significant challenges. Most off the shelf mathematical models often need refinement for specific applications. Addressing these challenges demand a close collaboration between chemists and mathematicians as chemists must formulate research questions in mathematical terms while mathematicians are required to refine models for specific applications. This review unites both disciplines to address dataset curation hurdles and highlight advances in polymer synthesis and modeling that enhance data availability. It then surveys ML approaches used to predict solid‐state properties, solution behavior, composite performance, and emerging applications such as drug delivery and the polymer–biology interface. A perspective of the field is concluded and the importance of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data and the integration of polymer theory and data are discussed, and the thoughts on the machine–human interface are shared.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Phase‐change materials (PCMs) are transforming reconfigurable photonics with their electrically tunable optical properties. This review examines the thermal challenges of scaling PCM devices to larger volumes beyond storage‐class applications, emphasizing thermal transport mechanisms, material properties, and design strategies. By integrating fundamental science and device engineering, it offers valuable insights for advancing reliable and scalable PCM‐based photonic systems.








Abstract
Advancements in nanofabrication processes have propelled nonvolatile phase change materials (PCMs) beyond storage‐class applications. They are now making headway in fields such as photonic integrated circuits (PIC), free‐space optics, and plasmonics. This shift is owed to their distinct electrical, optical, and thermal properties between their different atomic structures, which can be reversibly switched through thermal stimuli. However, the reliability of PCM‐based optical components is not yet on par with that of storage‐class devices. This is in part due to the challenges in maintaining a uniform temperature distribution across the PCM volume during phase transformation, which is essential to mitigate stress and element segregation as the device size exceeds a few micrometers. Understanding thermal transport in PCM‐based devices is thus crucial as it dictates not only the durability but also the performance and power consumption of these devices. This article reviews recent advances in the development of PCM‐based photonic devices from a thermal transport perspective and explores potential avenues to enhance device reliability. The aim is to provide insights into how PCM‐based technologies can evolve beyond storage‐class applications, maintain their functionality, and achieve longer lifetimes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review comprehensively summarizes the surface evolution and reconstruction of reversible protonic ceramic cell (R‐PCC) air‐electrodes. It begins by analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to surface evolutions, followed by a summary of factors that lead to electrochemical performance degradation, emphasizing on both the negative and positive effects of water. Additionally, recent advances in enhancing electrode surface activity are presented.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells (R‐PCCs) are at the forefront of electrochemical conversion devices, capable of reversibly and efficiently converting chemical energy into electricity at intermediate temperatures (350–700 °C) with zero carbon emissions. However, slow surface catalytic reactions at the air‐electrode often hinder their performance and durability. The electrode surface is not merely an extension of the bulk structure, equilibrium reconstruction can lead to significantly different crystal‐plane terminations and morphologies, which are influenced by material's intrinsic properties and external reaction conditions. Understanding electrode surface evolution at elevated temperatures in water‐containing, oxidative atmospheres presents significant importance. In this review, a comprehensive summary of recent processes in applying advanced characterization techniques for high‐temperature electrode surfaces is provided, exploring the correlations between surface evolution and performance fluctuations by examining the structural evolution and reconstruction of various air‐electrode surfaces associated with degradation and activation phenomena, offering insights into their impact on electrode performance. Furthermore, reported strategies and recent advances in enhancing the electrochemical performance of R‐PCCs through engineering air‐electrode surfaces is discussed. This review offers valuable insights into surface evolution in R‐PCCs and is expected to guide future developments in high‐temperature catalysis, solid‐state ionics, and energy materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) is proposed to construct a monolithic multifunctional detector. With a footprint one‐tenth the incident wavelength, the detector offers benchmarking intensity‐, frequency‐, and polarization‐sensitive detection, rapid response, and sub‐diffraction spatial resolution, all operating at room temperature across 0.22 to 4.24 THz. The unique advantages of the PPAC detector make it promising for high‐resolution imaging and polarization‐coded communication.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) signals are crucial for ultrawideband communication and high‐resolution radar, demanding miniaturized detectors that can simultaneously measure multiple parameters such as intensity, frequency, polarization, and phase. Traditional detectors fail to meet these needs. To address this, we introduce a plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC) detector based on monolayer graphene, offering a multifunctional, monolithic, and miniaturized solution. With a footprint only one‐tenth the size of the incoming wavelength, the PPAC achieves benchmark performance in intensity‐, frequency‐, and polarization‐sensitive detection. Operating at room temperature across 0.22–4.24 THz, it delivers sub‐diffraction detection resolution and high‐speed operation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its application in free‐space THz polarization‐coded communication and stealth imaging for physical property analysis. The unique design of PPAC enables strong absorption with weak signal detection, within a structure just 10−5 times the excitation wavelength in thickness, an accomplishment beyond current technologies. By simultaneously resolving intensity, frequency, and polarization, this detector can replace multiple single‐function devices, providing a compact and efficient solution for next‐generation ultrawideband communication and high‐resolution radar systems.

<title>Dual‐Defect Regulated G‐C3N4 for Piezoelectric Catalytic Tumor Therapy with Enhanced Efficacy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, a surface photoetching strategy is employed to introduce surface nitrogen vacancies on the repaired carbon nitride, significantly improving its piezoelectric performance. This defect‐engineered carbon nitride, serving as an excellent sonosensitizer, can temporally and spatially generate reactive oxygen species within tumor cells under ultrasound stimulation, thereby achieving effective piezoelectric catalytic therapy for cancer.








Abstract
Piezoelectric catalysis for tumor treatment is an emerging method for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the development and optimization of piezoelectric catalytic nanomaterials remain the major challenge. Herein, by regulating the internal and surface defects of graphene phase carbon nitride (defect‐engineered g‐C3N4), its piezoelectricity and sonocatalytic performance is enhanced, thus achieving efficient tumor treatment. By reducing bulk defects, the charges excited by ultrasound (US) within the defect‐engineered g‐C3N4 can migrate more rapidly to the material surface, thereby enhancing their participation in redox reactions. Increasing surface defects not only introduce more active sites on the surface of defect‐engineered g‐C3N4 but also enhance the asymmetry of the defect‐engineered g‐C3N4 structure, resulting in excellent piezoelectric properties. This defect‐engineered g‐C3N4 nanosheet can effectively generate ROS in tumor cells and induce tumor cell apoptosis under US stimulation. This work not only introduces a method to enhance the piezoelectric catalytic performance of g‐C3N4 but also expands the potential application of defect‐engineered piezoelectric materials to tumor treatment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The ‘Instant FLISA’ (fluorophore‐linked immunosorbent assay) biosensor enables rapid quantification of protein biomarkers at picomolar concentrations within 15 min in undiluted serum and plasma. This is achieved with the ‘monolithic dual‐antibody clamp’ reagent that tightly binds to the target molecule and produces a fluorescence signal which is detected with an optical fiber probe.








Abstract
For more than fifty years, the enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) serves as the gold standard for protein biomarker detection. However, conventional ELISA requires considerable sample preparation including reagent addition, incubation, and washing steps, limiting its usefulness at the point‐of‐care. In this work, the “instant ELISA” (fluorophore‐linked immunosorbent assay) biosensor that can measure protein biomarkers in the picomolar range within 15 min in undiluted plasma or serum with no sample preparation is described. The sensor leverages a synthetic reagent termed the “monolithic dual‐antibody clamp” (MDAC) which preserves the specificity, sensitivity, and generalizability of an ELISA, but produces a fluorescence signal as two surface‐tethered antibodies form a “sandwich” by binding to two distinct epitopes on the target. As exemplars, picomolar quantification of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)‐1, the latter of which is a useful prognostic indicator of cytokine release syndrome in patient plasma samples during chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy are demonstrated.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by marine sponges, the E7 peptide and EXOs‐functionalized “Cell Climbing Frame” with a hierarchical porous structure specifically recruits and rejuvenates autologous BMSCs, and enhances cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation by down‐regulating senescent‐related genes and decreasing SASP factor release, thereby promoting the repair of osteoporotic bone defects and achieving robust multi‐stage osseointegration.








Abstract
Osteoporosis, characterized by low bone mass and high fracture risk, challenges orthopedic implant design. Conventional 3D‐printed Ti6Al4V scaffolds are mechanically robust but suffer from poor bone regeneration in osteoporotic patients due to stress shielding and cellular senescence. In this study, a functionalized 3D‐printed Ti6Al4V “Cell Climbing Frame” is developed, aiming to adapt to the mechanical microenvironment of osteoporosis, effectively recruit and support the adhesion and growth of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), while rejuvenating senescent cells for improved bone regeneration. Inspired by marine sponges, the processing accuracy limitations of selective laser melting (SLM) technology is broke through innovatively constructing a hierarchical porous structure with macropores and micropores nested within each other. Results demonstrate that the unique hierarchical porous scaffold reduces the elastic modulus, facilitates blood penetration, and enhances cell adhesion and growth. Further surface functionalization with E7 peptides and exosomes promotes the attraction and rejuvenation of BMSCs and boosts migration, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. In vivo, the functionalized “Cell Climbing Frame” accelerates bone repair in osteoporotic rats, while delaying surrounding bone loss, enabling robust multi‐stage osseointegration. This innovation advances 3D‐printed regenerative implants for osteoporotic bone repair.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, a reliable and easily controllable approach is provided to prepare over 0.5‐kilogram colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), which feature high fluorescence quantum yields of over 90%, and afford their light‐emitting diodes with high efficiency, high brightness, and long operation stability.








Abstract
It is known that large‐scale synthesis of emitters affords colloidal quantum dot (CQD) materials with a great opportunity toward the mass production of quantum dot light‐emitting diodes (QLEDs) based commercial electronic products. Herein, an unprecedented example of scalable CQD (> 0.5 kilogram) is achieved by using a core/shell structure of CdZnSe/ZnSeS/CdZnS, in which CdZnSe, ZnSeS, and CdZnS alloys are used as the inner core, transition layer and outermost shell, respectively. It exhibits a high fluorescence quantum yield (>90%), a robust excited state, and a fast radiative transition rate. The investigation of morphology and surface state reveals the possible reasons for such excellent optical properties, which include uniform size distribution, no undesired byproducts, and high defect tolerance. The QLEDs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of over 21%, a high luminance of over 9.5×104 cd m−2, and a long lifetime of over 1.0×106 h, corresponding to the state‐of‐the‐art performance among the QLEDs based on the large‐scale synthesis of CQDs. Therefore, it is believed that an efficient and reliable strategy is provided toward the large‐scale synthesis of CQDs, which can be used as emitters in the QLEDs‐based commercial electronic devices and make the mass production of these products a reality.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Water‐free LiYb0.9Gd0.1F4 represents prominent −ΔSm values among the representative sub‐Kelvin‐temperature refrigerants throughout the whole temperature range from 0.1 to 1 K, demonstrating an exceptional specific cooling capacity of 46.943 mJ cm−3 T−1 at 300 mK in a self‐built two‐stage adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator.








Abstract
Adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration, which utilizes the magnetocaloric effect of magnetic refrigerants, stands as the sole cooling technology capable of achieving sub‐Kelvin temperatures efficiently and reliably without relying on scarce 3He resources or gravity. However, current sub‐Kelvin magnetic refrigerants encounter challenges such as structural instability in vacuum or under mild heating, along with small magnetic entropy change (−ΔSm) values, which significantly limit their practical applications. Here a water‐free magnetic refrigerant, LiGd0.1Yb0.9F4 is reported, prepared by introducing Li⁺ ions to reduce the dipolar interactions between Gd3+ ions and/or Yb3+ ions. Notably, this refrigerant possesses a magnetic ordering temperature of 85 mK, while its experimental −ΔSm reaches up to 136 mJ cm−3 K−1 (0.68 K and 2 T), more than three times the theoretical value of CrK(SO4)2·12H2O. Significantly, this refrigerant not only cools the test sample to temperatures as low as 160 mK but also achieves a specific cooling capacity of 46.943 mJ cm−3 T−1 at 300 mK. Remarkably, the specific cooling capacity at 300 mK is more than double that of commercial CrK(SO4)2·12H2O, representing one of the most notable values reported among all known magnetic refrigerants operating at sub‐Kelvin temperatures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study conclusively resolves the atomic configuration at the growth interface, unveiling a periodic molecular MoO3 layer van der Waals epitaxially grown on a single Al‐terminated sapphire (α‐Al2O3) surface. This structure, distinct from prior reports, aligns perfectly with experimental data and enhances the interaction between molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and α‐Al2O3. By introducing unique 1‐fold symmetry, it enables unidirectional MoS2 alignment, offering fresh insights into interfacial atomic engineering.








Abstract
The epitaxial growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) on sapphire substrates enables the formation of single‐crystalline monolayer MoS₂ with exceptional material properties on a wafer scale. Despite this achievement, the underlying growth mechanisms remain a subject of debate. The epitaxial interface is critical for understanding these mechanisms, yet its exact atomic configuration has previously been unclear. In this study, a monolayer single‐crystalline MoS₂ grown on a sapphire substrate is analyzed, decisively visualizing the atomic structure of the epitaxial interface and elucidating its role in epitaxial growth from an atomic perspective. The findings reveal that the interface consists of a periodic molecular MoO3 interlayer, van der Waals epitaxially grown on a single Al‐terminated sapphire surface. Additionally, it is discovered that MoO3 coverage enhances surface interactions and introduces a unique atomic arrangement with 1‐fold symmetry at the sapphire surface, thereby facilitating the unidirectional alignment of MoS₂. This discovery provides valuable insights into the growth mechanisms leading to single‐crystalline MoS₂ formation, and suggests pathways for quantitatively monitoring and controlling growth dynamics, for the improvement of material quality and process repeatability, applicable for single‐crystalline MoS₂ or potentially other transition metal dichalcogenides epitaxially grown on sapphire.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Narrowband response of organic semiconductors determines the band selectivity and anti‐interference in the photodetection process. For constructing strong anti‐interference photodetectors, a general strategy is developed to achieve narrowband ultraviolet‐responsive organic semiconductors by tuning the absorption state and intermolecular potential of organic semiconductor.








Abstract
Narrowband response of organic semiconductors determines the band selectivity and anti‐interference of the organic photodetectors, which are pursued for a long time but have not yet been resolved in the UV band. Herein, a feasible strategy is developed to realize narrowband UV response by tuning the absorption state and intermolecular potential of organic semiconductors. The as‐designed non‐Donor‐Acceptor molecule, 2,5‐diphenylthieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (2,5‐DPTT), exhibits narrowband absorption by fully suppressing the charge transfer state absorption. Simultaneously, the intermolecular potential is significantly enhanced (to ≈90 KJ mol−1) by modulating the molecular planarity. Consequently, the UV photodetector based on 2,5‐DPTT achieves excellent narrowband response at 310 nm wavelength and a record‐breaking photosensitivity (P = 1.21 × 106) in the deep UV range. In the demonstration application of flame alarm, the flame detector based on 2,5‐DPTT single crystal exhibits excellent anti‐interference capability. This work provides the inspiration for designing narrowband responsive organic semiconductors and building up multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

<title>Lyotropic Liquid Crystal Mediated Assembly of Donor Polymers Enhances Efficiency and Stability of Blade‐Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study reveals the concentration‐dependent self‐assembly of conjugated polymers, uncovering lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in several donor polymers. The extent of this self‐assembly process, determined by the solvent drying dynamics during blade coating, gives distinct film morphologies that significantly impact the device efficiency and stability, offering a framework for optimizing performance through precise control of coating conditions and polymer assembly.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers can undergo complex, concentration‐dependent self‐assembly during solution processing, yet little is known about its impact on film morphology and device performance of organic solar cells. Herein, lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) mediated assembly across multiple conjugated polymers is reported, which generally gives rise to improved device performance of blade‐coated non‐fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells. Using D18 as a model system, the formation mechanism of LLC is unveiled employing solution X‐ray scattering and microscopic imaging tools: D18 first aggregates into semicrystalline nanofibers, then assemble into achiral nematic LLC which goes through symmetry breaking to yield a chiral twist‐bent LLC. The assembly pathway is driven by increasing solution concentration – a common driving force during evaporative assembly relevant to scalable manufacturing. This assembly pathway can be largely modulated by coating regimes to give 1) lyotropic liquid crystalline assembly in the evaporation regime and 2) random fiber aggregation pathway in the Landau–Levich regime. The chiral liquid crystalline assembly pathway resulted in films with crystallinity 2.63 times that of films from the random fiber aggregation pathway, significantly enhancing the T80 lifetime by 50‐fold. The generality of LLC‐mediated assembly and enhanced device performance is further validated using polythiophene and quinoxaline‐based donor polymers.

<title>Anisotropic Electrical Transport in Mechanically Responsive Silver‐Coated Microparticle‐Gel Composites for Flowable Semiconducting Materials</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A stimuli‐responsive soft semiconducting composite is prepared with silver microspheres dispersed in a viscoelastic copolymer gel. With an electric field arcing parallel to the applied flow rate, an enhanced electrical signal is detected due to microstructural particle alignment in the same direction that promotes electron transport.








Abstract
Soft materials with reversible electrical and mechanical properties are critical for the development of advanced bioelectronics that can distinguish between different rates of applied strain and eliminate performance degradation over many cycles. However, the current paradigm in mechano‐electronic devices involves measuring changes in electrical current based on the accumulation of strain within a conductive material that alters the geometry through which electrons flow. Attempts have been made to incorporate soft materials like liquid metals and concentrated solutions of conjugated polymers and salts to overcome materials degradation but are limited in their ability to detect changes in the rate of the applied strain. Herein, the anisotropic electrical performance of a soft semiconducting composite prepared with silver‐coated microspheres dispersed within a swollen copolymer gel is demonstrated. This composite exhibits an electrical response proportional to the magnitude of the applied shear force to enable a rate‐of‐strain dependent conductivity. Furthermore, a 100‐fold increase in the conductivity of the composite is observed when the electric field is oriented parallel to the flow direction. This improvement in the electrical response can be attributed to the enhanced alignment of microspheres in viscoelastic media and can be leveraged in the development of mechanically responsive electronic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A smart covalent organic framework (Por‐HQ‐COF) possessing environment‐initiated switchable photocatalytic reduction and oxidation and H2O2 production, is constructed by engineering at a molecular level and the local phenol‐quinone structure of the skeletal building blocks. As a smart photocatalyst, Por‐HQ‐COF based on phenol‐quinone transformation can convert into Por‐BQ‐COF intelligently with a trigger, and vice versa.








Abstract
Developing multifunctional photocatalysts with intelligent self‐adjusting is of great significance in the photocatalytic process. Herein, a smart covalent organic framework (Por‐HQ‐COF) with a phenol‐quinone conversion structure with pH changes is constructed for photooxidation, photoreduction, and H2O2 production. As a smart photocatalyst, Por‐HQ‐COF can convert into Por‐BQ‐COF intelligently with a trigger including solution pH, and vice versa. The reconstruction of phenol‐quinone conversion not only significantly alters the morphologies and the specific surface areas of the COF, but also leads to an entirely change in the band energy and charge distribution to influence photoelectric properties. As a result, under acidic conditions, Por‐BQ‐COF converts into Por‐HQ‐COF automatically and can photoreduce high concentration Cr(VI) to Cr(III) efficiently. Under neutral conditions, the superoxide anions (·O2−) initiate the Por‐HQ‐COF reconstruction into Por‐BQ‐COF to accelerate photooxidation to degrade high‐concentration TC. Under alkaline conditions, Por‐HQ‐COF converts into Por‐BQ‐COF, can effectively photosynthesize H2O2 (1525 µmol h−1 g−1 at λ > 420 nm) in the absence of any sacrificial reagents, and reveal the strong alkalinity lower the energy barrier of hydrogen extraction from H2O and clarify active sites for H2O2 production. This work provides a new strategy for developing smart photocatalysts and fulfill the application across the full pH environment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The work reports on the synthesis and properties of AgNC@AgAux QDs with a core–shell heterostructure. This novel structure exhibits significantly enhanced photoluminescence, which can be attributed to electron injection and a strong local electric field induced by surface plasmons.








Abstract
Bimetallic core–shell quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise in elucidating the bimetallic synergism and optoelectronic devices. The synthesis and properties of AgNC@AgAux QDs of core–shell heterostructure are reported. Significantly enhanced photoluminescence emission on these heterostructures is observed. These enhancements are attributed to electron injection and the surface plasmon‐induced strong local electric field, which are observed through time‐resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. X‐ray absorption near edge structure spectra and density functional theory confirms the electron injection from the Ag core to the AgAux shell. On the other hand, the plasmon resonance of the AgNC@AgAux QDs has been studied by finite‐element method analysis and time‐resolved photoluminescence spectra. There are 94.06 times fluorescence enhancement and 32.40 times quantum yield improvement of oxygen content correlation compared to AgAu3 QDs. It shows a perfect correlation coefficient of 98.85% for the detection of heavy metal Cu2+ ions. Such Bimetallic core–shell heterostructures have great potential for future optoelectronic devices, optical imaging, and other energy‐environmental applications.

<title>Observation of Large Low‐Field Magnetoresistance in Layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO Films at High Temperatures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work obtains a notable low‐field magnetoresistance (1.2 × 103%, 0.1 T) in the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO films at a high temperature range (190–240 K). Such layered phases raise the tunneling barriers and magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures, where small ferromagnetic domains are embedded in the antiferromagnetic domains. The achievement of such notable LFMR at high temperatures will advance the magnetic devices.








Abstract
Large low‐field magnetoresistance (LFMR, < 1 T), related to the spin‐disorder scattering or spin‐polarized tunneling at boundaries of polycrystalline manganates, holds considerable promise for the development of low‐power and ultrafast magnetic devices. However, achieving significant LFMR typically necessitates extremely low temperatures due to diminishing spin polarization as temperature rises. To address this challenge, one strategy involves incorporating Ruddlesden–Popper structures (ABO3)n:AO, which are layered derivatives of perovskite structure capable of potentially inducing heightened magnetic fluctuations at higher temperatures. Here, a remarkable LFMR of up to 1.0×103% is obtained in the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO films with a high and wide temperature range (190–240 K). This finding underlines that the layered (NdNiO3)n:NdO (n = 1) structure show a complex magnetic structure above TMI of perovskite NdNiO3, where small ferromagnetic domains are embedded in the antiferromagnetic domains, raising the tunneling barriers and magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures. Furthermore, applying a low magnetic field (<0.1 T) near TMI effectively mitigates the disruption of antiferromagnetic order structures at boundaries, then a higher temperature is required to break the inhibition of ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition. The results contribute significantly to the advancement of magnetic devices capable of achieving substantial LFMR at room temperature.

<title>A Genetically Encoded Endogenous Antibody Recruitment Strategy for Innate Immune‐Mediated Killing of Cancer Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Antibody‐recruiting molecules (ARMs) can redirect endogenous antibodies to target cancer cells and induce killing; however, currently, they are limited by low antibody affinity. This study presents a novel ARM strategy using lipid nanoparticles to deliver mRNA encoding the common allergen Der p 2, fused to a membrane anchor, enabling high‐affinity antibody recruitment. In mice, this approach reduces pulmonary metastasis, with neutrophils as key effector cells. This mRNA LNP strategy offers promise for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Antibody‐recruiting molecules (ARMs) are bivalent molecules that contain a cell‐binding domain and an antibody‐binding domain. ARMs are designed to redirect circulating endogenous antibodies from the bloodstream to the surface of cancer cells and thereby trigger innate immune‐mediated killing of the latter. The current generation of clinically explored ARMs relies on synthetic small molecule haptens. However, their effectiveness is restricted by the low affinity of the available repertoire of endogenous anti‐hapten antibodies. Utilizing endogenous high‐affinity allergen‐specific antibodies could potentially circumvent this issue. In this study, a genetically encoded antibody‐recruiting strategy that utilizes lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver mRNA encoding the house dust mite allergen Der p 2, fused to a cell membrane anchor, to induce cell surface display and enable the recruitment of anti‐Der p 2 antibodies, is presented. Der p 2 mRNA LNP‐treated cancer cells cause greatly reduced pulmonary tumor burden in Der p 2 immunized mice, compared to untreated cells or nonimmunized mice. Reduced tumor growth is dependent on circulating antibodies, and neutrophils are identified as a key immune cell subset recognizing and eliminating Der p 2‐displaying cancer cells. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of mRNA LNPs as a powerful tool for generating a genetically encoded ARM strategy, with potential applications in cancer immunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The superconducting magnetization diode effect in stacking superconductors with ferromagnetic materials heterostructures, enabling robust magnetization readout through superconductivity with an ideally infinite on/off ratio, is demonstrated. Combining spin–orbit torque for current‐driven magnetization switching, this work bridges superconductivity and spintronics, offering scalable, energy‐efficient memory solutions with simplified design and improved performance.









Abstract
Stacking superconductors (SC) with ferromagnetic materials (FM) significantly impact superconductivity, enabling the emergence of spin‐triplet states and topological superconductivity. The tuning of superconductivity in SC‐FM heterostructure is also reflected in the recently discovered superconducting diode effect, characterized by nonreciprocal electric transport when time and inversion symmetries are broken. Notably, in SC‐FM systems, a time reversal operation reverses both current and magnetization, leading to the conceptualization of superconducting magnetization diode effect (SMDE). In this variant, while the current direction remains fixed, the critical currents shall be different when reversing the magnetization. Here, the existence of SMDE in SC‐FM heterostructures is demonstrated. SMDE uniquely maps magnetization states onto superconductivity by setting the read current between two critical currents for the positive and negative magnetization directions, respectively. Thus, the magnetization states can be read by measuring the superconductivity, while the writing process is accomplished by manipulating magnetization states through current‐driven spin–orbit torque to switch the superconductivity. The proposed superconducting diode magnetoresistance in SC‐FM heterostructures with an ideally infinite on/off ratio resolves the limitations of tunneling magnetoresistance in the magnetic tunneling junctions, thereby contributing to the advancement of superconducting spintronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study develops a library of lipopeptide‐based organ‐specific targeting (POST) lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The POST LNPs, screened in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate high efficiency and specificity in delivering mRNA and siRNA to the lung, liver, and spleen, respectively. Structure‐activity relationship analysis indicates that various lipid systems prefer specific lipopeptide structures for enhanced RNA delivery efficacy.









Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with highly efficient and specific extrahepatic targeting abilities are promising in gene delivery, and the lipopeptides (LPs) with excellent designability and functionality are expected to empower the construction of functional LNPs. This study aims to develop highly efficient ionizable components that accurately match different targeting lipid systems through the modular design of LPs. Based on this, a lipopeptide‐based organ‐specific targeting (POST) LNP screening strategy is constructed, in which lysine‐histidine‐based lipopeptides (KH‐LPs) are designed as highly efficient ionizable components. The optimal KH‐LP LNP screened in vitro shows excellent siRNA/mRNA transfecting ability in various hard‐to‐transfect cell lines. Compared to the classic LNPs, the POST LNPs screened in vivo achieve even higher (or at least comparable) efficiency and specificity in delivering mRNA and siRNA to the lung, liver, and spleen, respectively. The structure‐activity relationship (SAR) proves that the modular regulation of LP structures can accurately provide the optimal ionizable components for different targeting lipid systems, demonstrating the potential of this strategy in developing efficient and selective targeting systems, which is expected to open up more possibilities for gene therapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A low‐dimension ordered–disordered Mo(1−x)WxSe2 2D alloy with in‐plane nano‐segregations exhibits unique excitonic properties, enhanced valley polarization (up to 50%), and high implied open‐circuit voltage (up to 1130 mV). These features highlight its potential for advanced optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Well‐structured and ordered 2D layered semiconducting materials have excellent optical properties but limited advanced optoelectronic applications in their natural state. Altering their natural arrangement, through artificial heterostructures, strain and pressure engineering, chemical doping, intercalation, and alloying, can impart them with unusual optical properties and potentially enhance their performance in various applications. Among these approaches, alloying is generally difficult to control and disrupts the well‐ordered homophilic crystal phase of these 2D crystals, albeit with the capability to control materials as thin as a single atomic layer. In this work, the synthesis of a low‐dimension ordered–disordered layered 2D alloy of Mo(1−x)WxSe2 with clearly ordered in‐plane segregations of nano‐sized islands of individual MoSe2 and WSe2 across the material surface is reported. The optical analysis of this ordered–disordered layered Mo(1−x)WxSe2 reveals unique interfacial and interlayer coupling physics, such as the co‐existence of intralayer (interfacial) and interlayer excitons and enhanced valley polarization of up to 50%, which is traditionally absent in ordered MoSe2, WSe2, or their heterostructures. Furthermore, the structure exhibits implies open circuit voltage (up to 1130 mV), signifying its excellent open‐circuit voltage potential if employed in photovoltaic devices. Overall, the reported low‐dimension ordered–disordered semiconductor alloys can be useful in various optoelectronic applications.

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202415828?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel organic electrochemical device achieving over 90% reversible THz modulation via a conducting polymer is developed. The device demonstrates stability under repeated and continuous voltage switching and can operate in either depletion or accumulation modes. This device introduces a new option for future THz wireless sensing and communications, and application scope for organic mixed ionic‐electronic conductors.








Abstract
The sub‐Terahertz and Terahertz bands play a critical role in next‐generation wireless communication and sensing technologies, thanks to the large amount of available bandwidth in this spectral regime. While long‐wavelength (microwave to mm‐Wave) and short‐wavelength (near‐infrared to ultraviolet) devices are well‐established and studied, the sub‐THz to THz regime remains relatively underexplored and underutilized. Traditional approaches used in the aforementioned spectral regions are more difficult to replicate in the THz band, leading to the need for the development of novel devices and structures that can manipulate THz radiation effectively. Herein a novel organic, solid‐state electrochemical device is presented, capable of achieving modulation depths of over 90% from ≈500 nm of a conducting polymer that switches conductivity over a large dynamic range upon application of an electronically controllable external bias. The stability of such devices under long‐term, repeated voltage switching, as well as continuous biasing at a single voltage, is also explored. Switching stabilities and long‐term bias stabilities are achieved over two days for both use cases. Additionally, both depletion mode (always “ON”) and accumulation mode (always “OFF”) operation are demonstrated. These results suggest applications of organic electrochemical THz modulators in large area and flexible implementations.

<title>Hopping‐Phase Ion Bridge Enables Fast Li+ Transport in Functional Garnet‐Type Solid‐State Battery at Room Temperature</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hopping phase ion bridge (HPIB) is introduced into the interface between polyvinylidene fluoride and functionalized Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12; high‐throughput ion transporter (HTIT‐37) is constructed. The self‐adsorption of HPIB at the electrode–electrolyte interface effectively enhances the interfacial Li+ transport kinetics and suppresses the formation of lithium dendrites. It provides a more valuable option for the next generation of high energy density solid‐state batteries.








Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) containing Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) is widely regarded as leading candidate for high energy density solid‐state lithium‐metal batteries due to its exceptional ionic conductivity and environmental stability. However, Li2CO3 and LiOH layers at LLZTO surface greatly hinder Li+ transport between LLZTO‐polymer and the electrode–electrolyte interface. Herein, the surface of LLZTO is boronized to obtain functionalized LLZTO, and its conversion mechanism is clarified. By dissolving the crystal structure of cellulose to obtain hopping‐phase ion bridge (HPIB), which release the Li+ transport activity of its oxygen‐containing polar functional group (─OH, ─O─). Therefore, a high‐throughput ion transporter (HTIT‐37) with high ion transfer number (0.86) is prepared by introducing the HPIB into functionalized LLZTO and polyvinylidene fluoride interface by intermolecular hydrogen bond interaction, and it is demonstrated that the HPIB acts as a “highway” for the Li+ across this heterogeneous interface. Moreover, the HPIB is found to self‐adsorb on the SEI surface, leading to fast Li+ transport kinetics at anode–CPE interface. Thus, the lifespan of Li|HTIT‐37|Li is over 8000 h, and the critical current density exceeds 2.3 mA cm−2. The LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li and Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li battery remains stable with the HPIB‐enhanced electrode process, proving the application potential of LLZTO‐based CPE in high energy density SSLMB.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces a novel concept for broadband absorption metamaterial design—Metal–Insulator–Metal metamaterials with gradient resonators (GR‐MIMs). The GR‐MIMs absorber couples gradient resonant cavities in both nanoscale and microscale dimensions. By converting “resonance points” into “resonance bands,” the GR‐MIMs absorber achieves 93% ultra‐broadband high absorption (0.2–5 µm) at a thickness of 200 nm.








Abstract
Ultra‐broadband metamaterial absorbers can achieve near‐perfect absorption of omnidirectional electromagnetic waves, crucial for light utilization and manipulation. Traditional ultra‐broadband metamaterials rely on the superposition of different resonator units either in the plane or in perpendicular directions to broaden absorption peaks. However, this approach is subject to quantity restrictions and complicates the fabrication process. This study introduces a novel concept for broadband absorption metamaterial design—Metal–Insulator–Metal metamaterials with gradient resonators (GR‐MIMs) to surpass limitations in quantity and fabrication. The GR‐MIMs absorber features gradient resonant cavities in both nanoscale and microscale dimensions, each with continuous resonance points. By converting “resonance points” into “resonance bands” and perfectly coupling the two gradient resonators, the GR‐MIMs absorber with a thickness of only 200 nm demonstrates 93% ultra‐broadband high absorption across the UV, visible, near‐infrared, and mid‐infrared spectra (0.2–5 µm). Moreover, the solar spectrum absorption rate of the GR‐MIMs absorber can reach 94.5%, offering broad prospects for applications in solar energy utilization. The design of gradient resonators provides a new approach for the development of ultra‐broadband metamaterials and photothermal conversion metamaterials.

An ultrathin (≈84 nm) and robust protective layer is constructed by reactive molecular brushes (GO‐g‐PSSAg). Benefiting from the in situ reaction between PSSAg side‐chains and Li metal, the modified Li anode integrates abundant Li‐ion conducting PSSLi chains, robust GO backbones, and Li–Ag solid solution, thereby enabling molecular‐level homogeneous and fast Li‐ion diffusion, remarkable mechanical strength and homogeneous Li deposition.








Abstract
Mechanically stable and structurally homogeneous lithium–electrolyte interfacial layers are crucial in stabilizing lithium (Li) anodes for practical Li metal batteries. Herein, an ultrathin (≈84 nm) and robust artificial protective layer is constructed with reactive two‐dimensional (2D) molecular brushes as building blocks. The artificial protective layer can in situ react with underlying Li metal to produce a nanoscale poly(lithium styrenesulfonate)‐grafted graphene oxide (GO‐g‐PSSLi) layer on the outermost surface and an infinite Li–Ag solid solution in the anode. The nanoscale GO‐g‐PSSLi layer well integrates a large number of single Li‐ion conducting PSSLi chains and 2D robust GO backbones, thereby enabling molecular‐level homogeneous and fast Li‐ion diffusion as well as remarkable mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the simultaneously formed Li–Ag solid solution is beneficial for rapid Li transport in the anode to reduce the Li nucleation barrier and facilitate homogeneous deposition of Li. With such artificial protective layers, a prototype pouch cell with a thin Li metal anode (50 µm) and a high‐loading cathode (21.6 mg cm−2) delivers an impressive cycle life of over 350 cycles with 69% capacity retention under harsh conditions. Remarkably, ultrahigh charging power density of 456 W kg−1 and energy density of 325 Wh kg−1 can be simultaneously achieved in an Ah‐level pouch cell.

<title>Activating Halogen Circulation Enables Efficient and Stable Wide‐Bandgap Mixed‐Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work proposes a halide‐healing halogen circulation strategy to suppress Br−/I− ion migration in wide‐bandgap perovskites. Consequently, perovskite solar cells achieve an impressive 23.25% efficiency with a minimal open‐circuit voltage loss of 0.39 V in a 1.67 eV bandgap device. A tandem solar cell further demonstrates a high Voc of 1.99 V and an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 33.2%.








Abstract
Developing strategies to manage ion‐migration‐induced phase segregation in wide‐bandgap (WBG) perovskites is crucial for achieving high‐performance perovskite‐silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, maintaining continuous suppression of phase segregation from the film crystallization process to device operation remains a significant challenge. The present study demonstrates an efficient strategy of activating halogen circulation in WBG perovskite by using halogen circulation agents (HCA) of N‐halosuccinimide molecules as the sustainable stabilizers, in order to achieve dynamic halogen equilibrium within the precursor solution and perovskite film, which blocks the migration path of Br−/I− ions both in crystallization and aging of WBG perovskites. Attempts on in situ dynamic monitoring of halide migration visually verified the enhanced stability by activated halogen circulation in both WBG films and devices. Consequently, present work achieves a champion efficiency up to 23.25% with a low Voc loss of 0.39 V in the 1.67‐eV‐bandgap device, and the HCA‐based devices can maintain 88% and 93% of their initial efficiencies over 1000 h under continuous illumination and 2500 h at 85 °C in N2 atmosphere, respectively. As a proof of concept, the perovskite/silicon monolithic TSCs are fabricated to demonstrate a high Voc of 1.99 V and a high power conversion efficiency of 33.2%.

A multidimensional biomimetic cascade strategy for bone regeneration is developed by emulating the biomineralization cascade, hierarchical structure, and biological functions of bone tissue. The resulting composite, named “Osteomimix”, exhibits spontaneous in situ biomimetic mineralization in a cell‐free way, while fosters vascularized bone formation in a cell‐dependent way.








Abstract
Despite advancements in biomimetic mineralization techniques, the repair of large‐scale bone defects remains a significant challenge. Inspired by the bone formation process, a multidimensional biomimetic cascade strategy is developed by replicating the biomineralization cascade, emulating the hierarchical structure of bone, and biomimicking its biological functions for efficient bone regeneration. This strategy involves the photocrosslinking of sodium methacrylate carboxymethyl cellulose‐stabilized amorphous magnesium‐calcium phosphate with methacrylate‐modified type I collagen to create a self‐mineralizing hydrogel. The hydrogel is then integrated with either naturally derived or synthetic oriented bulk scaffolds. The resulting composite, named Osteomimix, provides excellent mechanical support and can be customized for irregular bone defects using CAD/CAM technology. Through in vitro and in vivo studies, this work finds that Osteomimix exhibits spontaneous in situ biomimetic mineralization in a cell‐free environment, while modulating immune responses and promoting vascularized bone formation in a cell‐dependent manner. Built on bone‐specific insights, this strategy achieves biomimicry across temporal, spatial, and functional dimensions, facilitating the seamless integration of artificial constructs with the natural tissue repair dynamics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A smart NIR‐to‐visible photon upconversion (UC) device with integrated photodetection (PD) and electroluminescence functionalities is developed. The device continuously monitors incident light intensity through its PD function and compensates for UC emission under low light conditions to achieve clear visualization of weak NIR light.








Abstract
Visualizing weak NIR light is critical for sensing, imaging, and communication, but remains challenging due to inefficient detection and upconversion (UC) mechanisms. A smart NIR‐to‐visible photon‐UC organic optoelectronic device is reported that integrates photodetection, light‐emitting diode (LED), and photovoltaic capabilities to enable clear visualization of weak NIR light. The programmable device has continuous photodetection monitoring of the incident NIR intensity. When the incident intensity falls below a preset threshold, the LED function is automatically triggered to compensate for the UC emission, amplifying the visualization. The smart multifunctional device uses a carefully designed ternary bulk heterojunction sensitizer doped with rubrene:DBP as the emitter. It demonstrates high UC efficiency (>1.5%) for upconversion from 808 to 608 nm, allowing NIR visualization without external power under strong illumination. It also shows excellent NIR photodetection with photoresponsivity of 0.35 A W−1 at 800 nm and specific detectivity reaching 10¹2–10¹3 Jones, enabling sensitive detection under low‐light conditions. It also exhibits a low turn‐on voltage (0.9 V) and luminance exceeding 1200 cd m−2 at 5 V, ensuring energy‐efficient light compensation. Furthermore, it achieves >10% power conversion efficiency, enabling sustainable self‐powered operation. This multifunctional, high‐performance system offers great potential in sensing, energy harvesting, and display technologies.

<title>Dual‐Descriptor Tailoring: Rational Solvent Molecule Tuning Enables High‐Voltage Li‐Ion Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dual‐descriptor approach is developed to design high‐voltage electrolytes, combining Mulliken charge and Laplacian bond order to identify ideal solvents. Acetonitrile (AN) stabilizes meta‐stable transition metal atoms and mitigates lattice oxygen instability at the cathode‐electrolyte interface. This strategy enables precise control of interfacial stability, advancing high‐voltage lithium‐ion batteries with a versatile and adaptive framework.








Abstract
Electrolyte engineering to enhance the cathode‐electrolyte interface stability is widely recognized as a promising strategy for achieving high‐voltage lithium‐ion batteries, which are currently hindered by the meta‐stable surface of lithium‐rich layered oxides. Despite significant progress in electrolyte development, clear design guidelines for high‐voltage electrolytes remain lacking, making solvent selection unpredictable. Here, a dual‐descriptor tailoring concept based on Mulliken charge (adsorption) and Laplacian bond order (antioxidation) to identify ideal solvent molecules for high‐voltage electrolytes is proposed. This concept stabilizes meta‐stable transition metal atoms in surface tetrahedral interstices through interactions between bottom solvent molecules and cathode dangling bonds. Acetonitrile (AN) is eventually selected as a promising bottom solvent that interacts strongly with unstable surface bonds, improving interfacial stability. Consequently, the prepared 0.6 Ah graphite||LCO pouch cell using AN‐based electrolyte maintained a remarkable 80% capacity retention after 900 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% at high cut‐off voltage. This work revisits the interfacial stability mechanism across different electrolyte classes, where strong solvent adsorption mitigates the instability of the meta‐stable Co spin state, reduces surface band overlap, and alleviates the instability of lattice oxygen at the interface. This dual‐descriptor‐guided design opens a new avenue for high‐voltage Li‐ion batteries is believed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A flexible bioelectronic microneedle patch (FBMP) for actively controlled transdermal drug delivery. Integrating a flexible circuit board, gallium‐indium heating film, and dual‐layer microneedles, the FBMP enables real‐time control via smartphone Bluetooth. It can control different drug release rates on demand, offering great potential for precise, personalized drug delivery for a variety of medical applications.









Abstract
Precise control over drug release rates is critical for enhancing therapeutic efficacy, reducing side effects, and maintaining stable drug levels. While microneedles (MNs) offer a promising approach for transdermal drug delivery, conventional passive‐response systems often lack adaptability across diverse drugs and disease models, limiting their versatility. Here, this work presents a flexible bioelectronic microneedle patch (FBMP) that integrates flexible electronics for actively controlled transdermal delivery. The FBMP incorporates a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB), a eutectic gallium‐indium (EGaIn) heating film, and dual‐layer microneedles with a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) core and polycaprolactone (PCL) shell. This configuration allows real‐time adjustment of the thermal response rate via smartphone‐controlled Bluetooth, achieving rapid drug release within 2 min or sustained release over 10 h. In various animal models, the FBMP demonstrate versatility in delivering multiple drug types, optimizing efficacy, and minimizing side effects for both acute and chronic conditions. Overall, this work introduces a flexible, universal electronic microneedle platform with significant potential to advance precision and personalized medicine by enabling customizable, actively controlled drug release.

<title>Solid Catholyte with Regulated Interphase Redox for All‐Solid‐State Lithium‐Sulfur Batteries</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202417171?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202417171?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a strategy for regulating the redox behavior of the solid catholyte toward dynamic interphase stability, which in turn stabilizes the main reaction of solid–solid sulfur redox. Leveraging this stabilizing mechanism, a newly formulated Li6.2P0.8W0.2S5I electrolyte with high reversibility is developed to build high‐performance all‐solid‐state lithium‐sulfur batteries.








Abstract
All‐solid‐state lithium‐sulfur battery (ASSLSB) is considered one of the ultimate next‐generation energy storage technologies due to the expected low cost, high safety, and high specific energy. The high‐conductivity and low‐modulus sulfide electrolytes hold promise as electrolytes in the cathode (i.e., solid catholytes) for ASSLSBs, but their parasitic decomposition and reactions over cycling lead to degradation of the active material−catholyte interphases and hence limited cycling life. Herein a strategy is described to stabilize the ASSLSBs by regulating the interphase redox reversibility of the sulfide catholyte, which is validated on a new sulfide electrolyte formulated as Li6+xP1−xWxS5I (LPWSI). The experiments show that the presence of mixed ionic‐electronic conducting WS2 boosts the Li4P2S7−to−Li3PS4 reaction in the interphase, which prevents irreversible accumulation of impeding P2S74− and thereby improves the catholyte's interphase stability. With the LPWSI catholyte, the ambient‐temperature ASSLSB exhibits stable cycling sustaining 92.2% capacity over 400 cycles at C/5 with an initial areal capacity of 1.95 mA h cm−2. Furthermore, the cells demonstrate excellent high‐rate stability over 1000 cycles at rates of 1C and 2C. The reported strategy contributes to reshaping the understanding of how solid catholyte can function in composite cathodes and provides new guidelines for designing catholyte for high‐capacity conversion‐based electrodes that involve complex evolution of interphases.

<title>A DNA Nanopatch‐Bacteriophage System Targeting Streptococcus Gallolyticus for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment and Colorectal Cancer Prevention</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, this work constructs a novel DNA nanopatch (DNPs)‐modified bacteriophages (P‐Sg) therapeutic platform (DNPs@P) for precise, gut‐targeted therapy that potently reduces inflammation and prevents the colonic inflammation‐to‐carcinoma transition. To protect DNPs@P from the harsh gastrointestinal environment, this work encapsulates them with an enteric polymer acrylic resin (L100‐55) (DNPs@P‐L). Upon oral administration, the L100‐55, ensures their safe passage through the stomach and release in the intestine. Then P‐Sg target and lyse pathogenic bacteria at inflammatory sites, delivering DNPs precisely to affected regions, which can scavenge ROS in the inflammatory site.








Abstract
Persistent inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases Streptococcus gallolyticus (Sg) colonization, increasing the risk of colorectal cancer progression via the Sg‐activated cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2) pathway and β‐catenin upregulation. This study presents Sg‐specific bacteriophages modified with DNA nanopatches (DNPs@P) designed to treat IBD and prevent Sg‐induced malignancy. The DNPs are composed of DNA origami nanosheets and phage capture strands. The DNPs scavenge reactive oxygen species, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the phages while targeting and lysing pathogenic bacteria. Coating with an enteric polymer, DNPs@P ensures effective delivery in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate significant restoration of colonic length, reduced inflammation, and improved gut microbiota diversity compared with current clinical treatments. Additionally, DNPs@P effectively prevents colonic tumourigenesis in mouse models. This approach presents a promising strategy for treating gastrointestinal diseases by remodeling the gut microenvironment, addressing a critical gap in current therapies.

<title>Supramolecular Engineering of Vinylene‐Linked Covalent Organic Framework – Ruthenium Oxide Hybrids for Highly Active Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A functionalized vinylene‐linked covalent organic framework adlayer is constructed to precisely tailor the orientation of interfacial water molecule to stabilize the transition state for intermediates adsorption/desorption, optimizing the proton exchange membrane water electrolysis performance.









Abstract
The controlled formation of a functional adlayer at the catalyst‐water interface is a highly challenging yet potentially powerful strategy to accelerate proton transfer and deprotonation for ultimately improving the performance of proton‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). In this study, the synthesis of robust vinylene‐linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) possessing high proton conductivities is reported, which are subsequently hybridized with ruthenium dioxide yielding high‐performance anodic catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In situ spectroscopic measurements corroborated by theoretical calculations reveal that the assembled hydrogen bonds formed between COFs and adsorbed oxo‐intermediates effectively orient interfacial water molecules, stabilizing the transition states for intermediate formation of OER. This determines a decrease in the energy barriers of proton transfer and deprotonation, resulting in exceptional acidic OER performance. When integrated into a PEMWE device, the system achieves a record current density of 1.0 A cm−2 at only 1.54 V cell voltage, with a long‐term stability exceeding 180 h at industrial‐level 200 mA cm−2. The approach relying on the self‐assembly of an oriented hydrogen‐bonded adlayer highlights the disruptive potential of COFs with customizable structures and multifunctional sites for advancing PEMWE technologies.

<title>Rare‐Earth Oxychlorides as Promoters of Ruthenium Toward High‐Performance Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysts for Alkaline Electrolyzers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The lamellar rare‐earth oxychlorides (REOCl) are innovatively used as promoters for ruthenium (Ru) as alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. The [RE2O2] and [Cl] layers act as the negative and positive charge transfer channels, respectively, which endows Ru surface with a high density of electrons, thus accelerating the hydroxyl peeling process.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline environments is vital for hydrogen production, owing to the extra water dissociation and hydroxyl desorption steps. Here, rare‐earth oxychlorides (REOCl) are proposed as innovative promoters for ruthenium as HER electrocatalyst in alkali. The lamellar structure of REOCl with weakly bond [Cl] layers can facilitate the formation of an internal electric field that enhances interphase charge transfer. Taking ruthenium/ neodymium oxychloride (Ru/NdOCl) composites as a case study, sub ≈4 nm Ru nanoparticles are successfully embedded into NdOCl crystals through a rapid self‐exothermic process, and the highly‐coupled Ru−Cl/O−Nd interfaces are observed as metallic Ru particles with the edge of the NdOCl lamellar layers, where the [Nd2O2] and [Cl] layers act as the negative and positive charge transfer channels, respectively. The enhanced charge transfer between REOCl and Ru makes the highly‐coupled Ru/REOCl catalysts show better electrocatalytic activity than both the benchmark Pt and Ru catalysts in alkaline electrolyte. This work will encourage more novel promoters for electrocatalysis and other emerging technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate into value‐added NH3 not only facilitates wastewater denitrification but also promotes nitrogen circulation. The hierarchical carbon‐based metal‐free electrocatalyst with multi‐topological defect‐induced active sites in graphene sheets/outside carbon layer and the pristine carbon nanotubes as the conductive core achieves high activity and durability for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate in a wide pH range.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (eNO3−RR) to ammonia (NH3) across varying pH is of great significance for the treatment of practical wastewater containing nitrate. However, developing highly active and stable catalysts that function effectively in a wide pH range remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a hierarchical carbon‐based metal‐free electrocatalyst (C‐MFEC) of winged carbon coaxial nanocables (W‐CCNs, in situ generated graphene nanosheets and outside carbon layer with abundant topological defects from pristine carbon nanotubes, CNTs), is prepared through moderate oxidation of CNTs and the subsequent introduction of topological defects. The W‐CCNs feature functional separation properties, with an inner core of pristine CNTs that facilitates efficient charge transfer, while the outer shell is composed of in situ generated graphene nanosheets and carbon layers enriched with topological defects characterized by distinct carbon atom configurations, which play a crucial role in promoting the adsorption of NO3−, the dissociation of water, and the N─H bond formation. This innovative design enables the C‐MFEC to exhibit outstanding performance for eNO3−RR, operating efficiently with the NH3 yield rates of 49.5, 75.3, and 88.1 g h−1 gcat.−1 in acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. Such performance metrics not only outshine C‐MFECs but also rival or surpass those of certain metal‐based catalysts.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stretchable and permeable liquid metal micromeshes are presented, characterized by strain‐insensitive resistance for potential applications in textile electronics. These micromeshes are produced by spin‐coating liquid metal onto microfiber textiles and then subjecting them to several stretching cycles. The considerable transformation in their microstructure alters the deformation mode during stretching, thereby effectively minimizing fluctuations in resistance.








Abstract
Gallium‐based liquid metals hold promises for applications in stretchable electronics and beyond. However, these materials often encounter notable resistance increases during stretching and have negligible permeability to gases and liquids. This study presents an in situ structural transformation mechanism to create stretchable and permeable liquid metal micromeshes with strain‐insensitive resistance. These micromeshes are fabricated by spin‐coating liquid metal onto microfiber textiles and subjecting them to several stretching cycles. Consequently, the micromeshes transform from a smooth finish to wrinkled textures due to the growth in their oxide nanoskins. The distinct microstructure alters the stretching‐relaxing mode to folding‐unfolding, thereby minimizing fluctuations in resistance. The practical significance of this development is demonstrated through the fabrication of wearable heaters and LED matrices using transformed liquid metal micromeshes. Moreover, when integrated into Janus textiles featuring unidirectional water transport, these micromesh conductors act as sensing electrodes capable of acquiring high‐fidelity biopotentials, even during intense sweating. These advancements highlight the capability of ambient air as a powerful reactive environment for tailoring the properties of microscale liquid metals.

Large, tunable room‐temperature magnetocurrent (MC) are crucial for advancing spintronic technologies. This study introduces an electro‐optical compensation strategy in organic semiconductor devices, achieving exceptionally high MC values of +13 200% and −10 600%. Leveraging this, a multifunctional device is activated, serving as the high‐sensitivity magnetic field sensor, composite field sensor, magnetic current inverter, and magnetically‐controlled artificial synaptic, etc.








Abstract
In spintronics, devices exhibiting large, widely tunable magnetocurrent (MC) values at room temperature are particularly appealing due to their potential in advanced sensing, data storage, and multifunctional technologies. Organic semiconductors (OSCs), with their rich and unique spin‐dependent and (opto‐)electronic properties, hold significant promise for realizing such devices. However, current organic devices are constrained by limited design strategies, yielding MC values typically confined to tens of percent, thereby restricting their potential for multifunctional applications. Here, this study introduces an electro‐optical compensation strategy to modulate MC values, which synergistically integrates and manages the interplays among carrier transport, spin‐dependent reactions, and photogenerated carrier dynamics in OSCs‐based devices. This approach achieves ultrahigh room‐temperature MC values of +13 200% and −10 600% in the designed devices, with continuous and precise tunability over this range—marking a breakthrough in organic spintronic devices. Building on this achievement, by integrating multiple controllable parameters—light, bias, magnetic field, and mechanical flexibility—into a single device, a flexible, room‐temperature, multifunctional device is activated, functioning as the high‐sensitivity magnetic field sensor, composite field sensor, magnetic current inverter, and magnetically‐controlled artificial synaptic, etc. These findings open an avenue for designing high‐performance, multifunctional devices with broad implications for future spintronic‐related technologies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A liquid–gas phase‐changing pneumatic actuator driven by optical light is introduced. By precisely controlling the light spot using a magnifying glass, the fiber actuator rolls on a horizontal plane in daylight. With an annular design, the actuator achieved vertical crawling under a fixed visible light source. It also demonstrates promising potential for load propulsion in forward movement. 








Abstract
Light‐driven wireless actuators provide obvious advantages for remote control. However, traditional double‐layer actuators are restricted to the thin film deformation mode when undertaking complex tasks. Here, an actuator is proposed that employs thermal strain and local photothermal effects induced by low boiling point liquids to generate asymmetry along the fiber axis, thereby causing elastic deformation of the fiber. Under continuous irradiation, the sustained elastic deformation results in dynamic frustration within the fiber, creating torque around its axis. Based on this principle, the fiber actuator fabricated in this study enables rolling translation, while the ring actuator achieves simultaneous rolling and lifting motion for object manipulation. Continuous rolling under light eliminates the need for complex light manipulation. This new movement method offers an insight for various application scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A reliable benchmark for qualitative and quantitative analysis of oxygen functional groups on carbon surface is established by in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. And the dynamic evolution of carbon surface reveals the special flame‐retardant effect and anchor metal ability of oxygen functionalities on carbon materials. These findings strengthen the understanding of carbon surface chemistry from an atomic perspective.








Abstract
The explicit roles of the hardly avoidable oxygen species on carbon materials in various fields remain contentious due to the limitations of characterization techniques, which lead to a lack of fundamental understanding of carbon surface chemistry. This study delves exhaustively into the comprehension of the features of different oxygen‐modified carbons through the dynamic evolution of surficial oxygen functional groups. Significant differences of thermal stability and electronic properties among various oxygen species are elucidated via in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, providing a reliable benchmark for identifying oxygen functional groups on carbon materials. The chemical properties of the carbon materials are simultaneously investigated to show the influence of the oxygen functional groups on carbon structures, redox stability, and scalable metal adsorption. These findings not only consider the common misconception that oxygen species produced under various conditions possess identical properties but also raise awareness of understanding carbon surface chemistry in the atomic level.

The mechanisms of glass fiber (GF) and Zn─Mn atom pairs‐modified glass fiber separator (named as ZnMn‐NC/GF) work in zinc‐halogen batteries. The Mn‐N4 single‐atom sites are responsible for adsorption, while the Zn─Mn atom pairs are responsible for catalysis. The polyiodide can be rapidly captured and further transformed into I‐ before it reaches zinc anodes through this effective ZnMn‐NC modified layer.









Abstract
Aqueous Zn‐halogen batteries (Zn‐I2/Br2) suffer from grievous self‐discharge behavior, resulting in irreversible loss of active cathode material and severe corrosion of zinc anode, which ultimately leads to rapid battery failure. Herein, an entrapment‐adsorption‐catalysis strategy is reported, leveraging Zn─Mn atom pairs‐modified glass fiber separator (designated as ZnMn‐NC/GF), to effectively mitigate the self‐discharge phenomenon. The in situ Raman and UV experiments, along with theoretical calculations, confirmed the single‐atom Mn sites are responsible for polyiodides adsorption, while Zn─Mn atom pairs facilitated the conversion of reaction intermediates. As a result, the utilization rate of cathode active species is enhanced through this ZnMn‐NC/GF separator. The fully charged Zn‐I2 battery assembled with ZnMn‐NC/GF maintained a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 90.1% after being left for 120 h, as well as a capacity retention rate of 95.3% after 30000 cycles at a current density of 5 A g−1. Additionally, the Zn‐Br2 battery designed with ZnMn‐NC/GF separator can withstand more serious self‐discharge problems of bromine species, with an average discharge voltage platform of 1.75 V at 0.5 A g−1. The self‐discharge problem of aqueous Zn‐halogen batteries is significantly suppressed by this entrapment‐adsorption‐catalysis strategy, which can serve as a crucial reference for the advancement of high‐performance aqueous Zn‐halogen batteries.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al₂O₃ on ZnMgO nanocrystals eliminates aging‐induced performance variability in quantum dot light‐emitting diodes (QD‐LEDs). This scalable passivation strategy suppresses nanocrystal ripening and passivates surface traps, achieving reproducible 17% external quantum efficiency, a tenfold increase in device operational stability, and consistent performance sustained over 39 weeks.








Abstract
Quantum dot light‐emitting diodes (QD‐LEDs) with stable high efficiencies are crucial for next‐generation displays. However, uncontrollable aging, where efficiency initially increases during storage (positive aging) but is entirely lost upon extended aging (negative aging), hinders further device development. It is uncovered that it is chemical changes to nanocrystal (NC)‐based electron transport layer (ETL) that give rise to positive aging, their drift in structure and morphology leading to transiently improved charge injection balance. Using grazing‐incidence small‐angle X‐ray scattering, it is found that ZnMgO NCs undergo size‐focusing ripening during aging, improving size uniformity and creating a smoother energy landscape. Electron‐only device measurements reveal a sevenfold reduction in trap states, indicating enhanced surface passivation of ZnMgO. These insights, combined with density functional theory calculations of ZnMgO surface binding, inspire an atomic layer deposition (ALD) strategy with Al₂O₃ to permanently suppress surface traps and inhibit NC growth, effectively eliminating aging‐induced efficiency loss. This ALD‐engineered ZnMgO ETL enables reproducible external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 17% across 30 batches of LEDs with a T60 of 60 h at an initial luminance of 4500 cd m−2, representing a 1.6‐fold increase in EQE and a tenfold improvement in operating stability compared to control devices.

A spatiotemporal segmentation immunotherapy strategy uses modular microneedles to modulate paradoxical postoperative immunization microenvironments. The modular microneedles load a personalized antitumor vaccine and demonstrate broad antitumor activities in postoperative immunotherapy, reducing recurrence and the incidence of perioperative wound complications.








Abstract
The perioperative period is crucial for determining postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis. Various factors in postoperative lesions can diminish the therapeutic effect of conventional chemoradiotherapy, while emerging immunotherapy is restricted. The combination use of inflammatory inhibitors during treatment is also controversial. Here, a modular microneedle prepared from engineered keratin proteins is reported, which spatially and temporally differentiates the microenvironment of immune cell activation required for immunotherapy from that of wound healing. The recombinant keratin‐84‐T‐based needle root layer, mainly retained in the epidermis, facilitated dendritic cell recruitment to achieve maximum antigen presentation of loaded vaccines. Meanwhile, the recombinant keratin‐81‐1Aα‐based needle tip layer, located within the dermis, rapidly mitigated inflammatory responses while promoting tissue repair and regeneration. Unlike simply mixing immunotherapy and wound treatment, this spatiotemporal segmentation approach maximized the efficacy of immune therapeutics while promoting wound healing, making it suitable for application throughout the perioperative period.

The acceptor BTP‐Cy, featuring cyclohexyl side chains, is synthesized to control molecular aggregation state in solution. Compared to molecules containing benzene and undecyl side chains, BTP‐Cy‐based active layer exhibits suitable solubility and molecular aggregation size, leading to an optimal liquid precursor film length and film morphology. Consequently, all‐printed 23.6 cm2 BTP‐Cy‐based modules achieve a power conversion efficiency of 16.2%.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all‐printed organic solar cells (OSCs) remain inferior to those of spin‐coated devices, primarily due to morphological variations within the bulk heterojunction processed via diverse coating/printing techniques. Herein, cyclohexyl is introduced as outer side chains to formulate a non‐fullerene acceptor, BTP‐Cy, aimed at modulating the molecular aggregation in solution and subsequent film formation kinetics during printing. Investigations demonstrate that BTP‐Cy molecule with cyclohexyl side chains exhibits enhanced intermolecular π‐π stacking, optimal solution aggregation size, and favorable phase separation. Consequently, PB3:FTCC‐Br:BTP‐Cy‐based OSCs achieve remarkable PCEs of 20.2% and 19.5% via spin‐coating and blade‐coating, respectively. Furthermore, a 23.6 cm2 module exhibits a remarkable efficiency of 16.7%. This study offers a fresh perspective on tailoring the film formation kinetics of photoactive materials during printing through molecular design, paving a novel path to enhance the efficiency of all‐printed OSCs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High‐performance ultralong biomass room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) doped systems with phosphorescence quantum up to 32.8%, lifetime up to 4.65 s, and multi‐stimulus response through multiple interactions between host biomass macrocycle and guest is reported. The RTP performance of biomass macrocycle doped systems far exceeds biomass systems ever reported and compares favorably with highly effective polymer systems.








Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable, high‐performance organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with stimulus‐responsive properties presents a significant and enticing yet formidable challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy to confining boric acid‐based compounds into biomass macrocycle γ‐cyclodextrin through multiple interactions is developed, enabling the construction of high‐performance and multicolor OURTP doped systems. The synergistic effects of strong hydrogen bonding, C─O─B covalent cross‐linking, and host–guest encapsulation significantly suppress non‐radiative transition, culminating in an extraordinary lifetime and excellent phosphorescence quantum yield of 4.65 s and 32.8%, respectively, which are far superior to reported biomass RTP materials. Additionally, merging biomass macrocycle with phosphors contributes to multiple stimulus responses, overcoming the inherent limitations of degradation and recycling of organic RTP compounds, and dynamically modulating RTP signals through multiple‐stimulus responses, achieving the integration of multifunctional dynamic data processing techniques. This work will provide a direction for new environmentally friendly and potentially commercially available stimulus‐responsive OURTP materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A nanowire assemblies‐induced geometry engineering method is reported to fabricate a photoresponsive liquid crystal actuator with mechanically incompatible geometry, exhibiting a saddle‐like appearance. By regulating the off‐axis director angle and strip width, the configurations of the actuators undergo sharp and periodic transitions among the rings, helicoids, and spirals, enabling the generation of multi‐modal photo‐driven locomotion with fast velocities and high controllability.








Abstract
Photoresponsive shape‐changing materials have significant applications in miniaturized smart robotics and biomedicine powered in a remote and wireless manner. Existing light‐fuelled soft materials suffer from limited continuous shape manipulation and constrained mobility and locomotive modes. One promising solution is developing a hierarchical structure design approach to integrate rapid, reversible photoactive molecular alignment and mechanically incompatible geometry in a macroscopic system. Here, a nanowire assemblies‐induced geometry engineering method is reported for the fabrication of silver nanowire‐incorporated nematic liquid crystalline elastomers with prominent anisotropic structures at multi‐length scales and incompatible elasticity that show sharp morphological transitions among the rings, helicoids, and spirals with diverse helical configurations. The engineered composite films can realize complex light‐driven motions including rotating, rolling, and jumping with the controlled directionality and magnitude that are pre‐encoded in their both molecular and macroscopic configurations. Owing to the great controllability of multimodal locomotion, a spiral robot can undertake task‐specific configuration to climb up complex terrains. The complete regulatory relationship among molecular orientation, shape geometry, and light‐driven motions is also established. This study may open an avenue for elaborate design and precise fabrication of novel shape‐morphing materials for future applications in intelligent robotic systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Covalent peptide assembly integrates the robustness of covalent bonds with the adaptability of dynamic non‐covalent interactions. Systematic amino acid substitution screening yields programmable peptide frameworks, facilitating the advanced engineering of features such as frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architectures, affinity enrichment, stimuli‐responsive behavior, and signal amplification. This approach revolutionizes multicomponent peptide assembly, offering enhanced complexity, versatility, and multifunctional potential.








Abstract
Covalent peptide assembly leverages robust covalent bonds and dynamic non‐covalent interactions to provide enhanced stability and introduce diverse functionalities. Nevertheless, it remains significantly challenging to achieve modular control over the structural diversity and functional complexity while elucidating how specific amino acid sequences contribute to these processes. Here, the systematic encoding of peptide derivative characteristics is demonstrated through amino acid modularity to enable precise control over both the structural diversity and functional complexity in covalent peptide assemblies. By systematically screening single amino acid substitutions in pentapeptides using tyrosine crosslinking, a diverse library of peptide constructs is developed. Each construct is tailored to exhibit distinct properties, including charge repulsion, aggregation‐induced quenching, disassembly behavior, and redox responsiveness. The strategic manipulation of sequence composition, both in individual assemblies and combinatorial systems, enables programmable control over the structural diversity and functional complexity. This approach yields various module‐specific functions, including frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architecture formation, affinity enrichment, stimuli‐responsive behavior, and fluorescence signal amplification. This work establishes a framework for the design of modular peptide materials with programmable functionalities, advancing the development of next‐generation multicomponent peptide assembly technologies characterized by unprecedented complexity and adaptability.

<title>Unifying Electrochemically‐Driven Multistep Phase Transformations of Rutile TiO2 to Rocksalt Nanograins for Reversible Li+ and Na+ Storage</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419999?af=R</link>
<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419999?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work reveals the insight reason for the Li+ and Na+ storage performance of the rutile phase, which is determined by the electrochemically driven formed rocksalt nanograins. Importantly, the electrochemically in situ formed rocksalt phase has open diffusion channels for rapid Li+ or Na+ (de)intercalations through a solid‐solution mechanism, which determines the pseudocapacitive, “mirror‐like” cyclic voltammetry curves and excellent rate capabilities.








Abstract
Rutile titanium dioxide (TiO2(R)) lacks octahedral vacancies, which is not suitable for Li+ and Na+ intercalation via reversible two‐phase transformations, but it displays promising electrochemical properties. The origins of these electrochemical performances remain largely unclear. Herein, the Li+ and Na+ storage mechanisms of TiO2(R) with grain sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm are systematically investigated. Through revealing the electrochemically‐driven atom rearrangements, nanosize effect and kinetics analysis of TiO2(R) nanograins during repeated cycling with Li+ or Na+, a unified mechanism of electrochemically‐driven multistep rutile‐to‐rocksalt phase transformations is demonstrated. Importantly, the electrochemically in situ formed rocksalt phase has open diffusion channels for rapid Li+ or Na+ (de)intercalation through a solid‐solution mechanism, which determines the pseudocapacitive, “mirror‐like” cyclic voltammetry curves and excellent rate capabilities. Whereas, the nanosize effect determines the different Li+ and Na+ storage capacities because of their distinct reaction depths. Remarkably, the TiO2(R)‐10 nm anode in situ turns into rocksalt nanograins after 30 cycles with Na+, which delivers a reversible capacity of ≈200 mAh g−1, high‐rate capability of 97 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 and long‐term cycling stability over 3000 cycles. The findings provide deep insights into the in situ phase evolutions with boosted electrochemical Li+ or Na+ storage performance.

<title>Colloidal Ink Engineering for Slot‐Die Processes to Realize Highly Efficient and Robust Perovskite Solar Modules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A strategy is presented for fabricating high‐efficiency, highly stable perovskite solar cells, and minimodules using a slot‐die process based on colloidal inks. By incorporating the antisolvents toluene and chlorobenzene as modulator solvents, a colloidal ink system is formulated with superior rheological properties compared to conventional precursor inks. This colloidal strategy achieves devices with a maximum efficiency of 21.32% and remarkable long‐term stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising alternative to silicon solar cells, but challenges remain in developing perovskite inks and processes suitable for large‐scale production. This study introduces a novel approach using colloidal inks incorporating toluene and chlorobenzene as co‐antisolvents for PSC fabrication via slot‐die process. It is found that colloidal inks that are strategically engineered can significantly improve the rheological properties of perovskite inks, leading to enhanced wettability and high‐quality film formation. The formation of large colloids such as α cubic perovskite, δ hexagonal perovskite and transition intermediate phases promotes heterogeneous nucleation and lowers activation energy for crystallization, resulting in superior crystal growth and improved film morphology. Notably, the co‐solvent enhances the FA‐PbI3 binding energy and weakens the dimethyl sulfoxide coordination, which is more thermodynamically favorable for perovskite crystallization. This colloidal strategy yields devices with a maximum efficiency of 21.32% and remarkable long‐term stability, retaining 77% of initial efficiency over 10115 h. The study demonstrates the scalability of this approach, achieving 20.26% efficiency in lab‐scale minimodules and 19.15% in larger convergence minimodules. These findings provide an understanding of the complex relationship between ink composition, rheological properties, film quality, crystallization kinetics, and device performance.

<title>“Pumping” Trace Cu Impurity out of Zn Foil for Sustainable Aqueous Battery Interface</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Copper exists as trace impurity in commercial Zn foil and generally gets ignored in terms of its potential for regulating Zn electrodeposition. Herein, it is demonstrated how trace amount of internal Cu atoms can be readily “pumped” out, in one step, to get concentrated on Zn foil surface and to further suppress dendritic Zn electrodeposition as a sustainable aqueous battery interface.









Abstract
Dendritic zinc (Zn) electrodeposition presents a significant obstacle to the large‐scale development of rechargeable zinc‐ion batteries. To mitigate this challenge, various interfacial strategies have been employed. However, these approaches often involve the incorporation of foreign materials onto Zn anode surface, resulting in increased material costs and processing complexities, not to mention the compromised interface endurability due to structural and compositional heterogeneity. Realizing that Cu atoms typically exist as trace impurities in commercial Zn, a novel approach is demonstrated that leverages these Cu impurities to create a Cu‐rich surface for effective modulation of Zn electrodeposition. By simply heating commercially available Zn foil with a naturally oxidized surface, not only the internal Cu atoms are thermally activated to become diffusible, their diffusion is also navigated toward the surface via oxygen attraction. The resulting Cu‐rich surface effectively regulates Zn electrodeposition, comparable to conventional interfacial strategies, yet exhibits superior cycling durability. 3D in situ microscopy confirms that this Cu‐rich surface enables dendrite‐free, compact, and (101)‐oriented Zn electrodeposition, contrasting with the traditional (002)‐oriented dendrite‐suppression mechanism. By transforming trace Cu impurity within Zn foil into a Cu‐rich surface, this work demonstrates a straightforward, cost‐effective and efficient method for controlling Zn electrodeposition.

<title>Myocardia‐Injected Synergistically Anti‐Apoptotic and Anti‐Inflammatory Poly(amino acid) Hydrogel Relieves Ischemia‐Reperfusion Injury</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A bioactive thermo‐sensitive poly(amino acid) hydrogel is demonstrated to release the therapeutic drug FTY720 in a reactive oxygen species‐controlled manner and achieves a synergistic effect by inhibiting apoptosis and regulating the reperfusion inflammatory microenvironments, thereby reducing ischemia‐reperfusion injury and promoting tissue repair, demonstrating significant clinical potential for the treatment of ischemia‐reperfusion injury.








Abstract
Reperfusion therapy is the most effective treatment for acute myocardial infarction, but its efficacy is frequently limited by ischemia‐reperfusion injury (IRI). While antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory therapies have shown significant potential in alleviating IRI, these strategies have not yielded satisfactory clinical outcomes. For that, a thermo‐sensitive myocardial‐injectable poly(amino acid) hydrogel of methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)45‐poly(L‐methionine20‐co‐L‐alanine10) (mPEG45‐P(Met20‐co‐Ala10), PMA) loaded with FTY720 (PMA/FTY720) is developed to address IRI through synergistic anti‐apoptotic and anti‐inflammatory effects. Upon injection into the ischemic myocardium, the PMA aqueous solution undergoes a sol‐to‐gel phase transition and gradually degrades in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS), releasing FTY720 on demand. PMA acts synergistically with FTY720 to inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis and modulate pro‐inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization toward anti‐inflammatory M2 macrophages by clearing ROS, thereby mitigating the inflammatory response and promoting vascular regeneration. In a rat IRI model, PMA/FTY720 reduces the apoptotic cell ratio by 81.8%, increases vascular density by 34.0%, and enhances left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by 12.8%. In a rabbit IRI model, the gel‐based sustained release of FTY720 enhanced LVEF by an additional 7.2% compared to individual treatment. In summary, the engineered PMA hydrogel effectively alleviates IRI through synergistic anti‐apoptosis and anti‐inflammation actions, offering valuable clinical potential for treating myocardial IRI.

<title>Photoinduced Cleavage of Respiratory Syncytial Virus by Chiral Vanadium Trioxide Nanoparticles</title>

Strongly chiral V2O3 NPs with optical responsiveness achieve targeted and precise cleavage of the RSV pre‐fusion protein through photoinduction, thereby inhibiting respiratory syncytial virus.








Abstract
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) poses a significant threat to the health of infants, children, and the elderly, and as of now there is a lack of effective therapeutic drugs. To tackle this challenge, chiral vanadium trioxide nanoparticles (V2O3 NPs) with a particle size of 2.56 ± 0.34 nm are successfully synthesized, exhibiting a g‐factor value of 0.048 at 874 nm in terms of circular dichroism. Under 808 nm light irradiation, these chiral V2O3 NPs demonstrated selective cleavage of the RSV pre‐fusion protein (RSV protein), effectively blocking its conformational rearrangement and preventing RSV infection both in vitro and in vivo. Experimental analysis revealed that the chiral V2O3 NPs specifically bind to the functional domain spanning from aspartate200 (D200) to asparagine208 (N208) in the primary sequence of the RSV protein. Notably, L‐V2O3 NPs exhibited a higher affinity, which is 4.06 times that of D‐V2O3 NPs and 13.55 times that of DL‐V2O3 NPs. The precise cutting site is located between amino acid residues leucine204 (L204) and proline205 (P205), attributed to the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by photoinduced nanoparticles. In addition, L‐V2O3 NPs inhibited RSV infection by 99.6% in nasal epithelial cells and 99.2% in Vero cells. In the RSV‐infected mouse model, intranasal administration of L‐V₂O₃ NPs effectively controlled the viral load in the lungs of mice, reducing it by 92.43%. The hematoxylin and eosin staining of mouse organs and serum biochemical indicators are similar to those of the wild‐type group, indicating the biosafety of L‐V₂O₃ NPs. The findings suggest that chiral nanoparticles hold great potential in controlling RSV and provide new directions and ideas for drug development against viruses.

This article describes the convergence of materials science and art through the creation of self‐assembled block copolymer lamellar thin films with vivid iridescence. These films are applied as coatings on window panels for an architectural installation as well as transformed into porous, structurally colored ceramics. The work demonstrates the potential of nanoscale engineering in artistic and architectural contexts.








Abstract
Art and materials innovation have always been intertwined, dating back to the earliest human creations. In modern times, however, the increasing specialization of materials science often restricts artists' access to cutting‐edge materials. Here, the materials science aspects of an art‐science collaboration between artist Kimsooja and the Wiesner Lab at Cornell University, are detailed. The project involves the development of a custom‐made iridescent block copolymer coating by means of self‐assembly, originally applied to transparent window panels of a façade for the ≈14 m tall art installation: A Needle Woman: Galaxy Is a Memory, Earth is a Souvenir by artist Kimsooja. After several exhibitions in the US and Europe, the installation is now part of the permanent museum collection at Yorkshire Sculpture Park in Wakefield, UK. Full characterization of the solution blade‐cast coatings show shear aligned, standing up lamellar morphologies that behave as volume‐phase gratings with periodicities between 300 and 400 nm. Coatings are also applied to foldable (origami) paper and converted into iridescent porous ceramic materials. It is hoped this work inspires and informs communities across materials science, the arts, and architecture.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stretchable bioelectronics conforming to dynamic body surfaces enable high‐fidelity physiological monitoring but often suffer from motion artifacts. All‐printed strain‐insensitive bioelectronics are presented using a universal gradient interface (UGI) created via aerosol‐based multi‐materials printing (AMMP). The UGI minimizes local strain changes under 180% stretch, supporting artifact‐free sensors for health monitoring and advancing wearable and implantable bioelectronics for personalized healthcare.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on‐skin devices for high‐fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain‐induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here all‐printed super stretchable strain‐insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) are reported to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol‐based multi‐materials printing technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain‐insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% uniaxial stretch ratio. Various stretchable devices are directly printed on the UGI for on‐skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near‐perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor‐based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal‐based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real‐time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.

A self‐assembled colloidal topological laser with CW room‐temperature pumping is presented, featuring extensive wavelength tunability, ultra‐high polarization, and good temporal stability. Precise control over a single NPL layer thickness allows excellent performance in semiconductor lasers, advancing solution‐processed systems for display technology and modern communication.








Abstract
The field of optoelectronic integrated circuits is actively developing reliable and efficient room‐temperature continuous‐wave (CW) lasers. CW‐pumped lasers combine the economical and simple manufacturing processes of colloidal semiconductor lasers with the efficient and stable output of continuous pumping, enabling them to significantly impact the field of semiconductor lasers. However, development is still severely challenged by limitations such as gain materials and cavity structures. Consequently, as a compromise, most colloidal semiconductor lasers proposed to date have relied on another pulsed laser as the pumping source. In this study, a self‐assembled colloidal topological laser is proposed that benefits from CW pumping at room temperature. By utilizing an interfacial self‐assembly strategy, nanoplatelets (NPLs) are managed to control the collective orientation (face‐down or edge‐up), achieving controlled polarization of amplified spontaneous emission for the first time. Furthermore, precise control over the thickness of a single NPL layer is demonstrated, which enables the laser system to offer extensive wavelength tunability (over 50 nm), ultra‐high polarization (over 95%), and good temporal stability. These metrics signify the optimal performance level of colloidal semiconductor lasers, marking a new era in solution processing systems for the optoelectronic integrated circuit field.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
F‐N‐C catalysts with high density of accessible sites (D‐Fe‐N/C) is fabricated by a cascade capturing strategy. Systematic structural and electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the high active site density and site utilization enable D‐Fe‐N/C showcases excellent ORR performance, which is further verified in laminated zinc‐air batteries with remarkable durability and temperature‐adaptive.








Abstract
Designing single‐atom catalysts (SACs) with high density of accessible sites by improving metal loading and sites utilization is a promising strategy to boost the catalytic activity, but remains challenging. Herein, a high site density (SD) iron SAC (D‐Fe‐N/C) with 11.8 wt.% Fe‐loading is reported. The in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technique attests that the accessible active SD and site utilization of D‐Fe‐N/C reach as high as 1.01 × 1021 site g−1 and 79.8%, respectively. Therefore, D‐Fe‐N/C demonstrates superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in terms of a half‐wave potential of 0.918 V and turnover frequency of 0.41 e site−1 s−1. The excellent ORR property of D‐Fe‐N/C is also demonstrated in the liquid zinc‐air batteries (ZABs), which exhibit a high peak power density of 306.1 mW cm−2 and an ultra‐long cycling stability over 1200 h. Moreover, solid‐state laminated ZABs prepared by presetting an air flow layer show a high specific capacity of 818.8 mA h g−1, an excellent cycling stability of 520 h, and a wide temperature‐adaptive from −40 to 60 °C. This work not only offers possibilities by improving metal‐loading and catalytic site utilization for exploring efficient SACs, but also provides strategies for device structure design toward advanced ZABs.

This study presents a simple self‐assembly strategy to construct Type I photosensitizer nanocluster. Facile intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer within nanocluster forms photosensitizer radical cation and anion via autoionization. These radicals engage in cascade photoredox to generate efficient reactive oxygen species, achieving 97.6% antibacterial efficacy against MRSA that surpasses the efficacy of commercial antibiotic Vancomycin by 8.8‐fold.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) holds significant promise for antibacterial treatment, with its potential markedly amplified when using Type I photosensitizers (PSs). However, developing Type I PSs remains a significant challenge due to a lack of reliable design strategy. Herein, a Type I PS nanocluster is developed via self‐assembly of zwitterionic small molecule (C3TH) for superior antibacterial PDT in vivo. Mechanism studies demonstrate that unique cross‐arranged C3TH within nanocluster not only shortens intermolecular distance but also inhibits intermolecular electronic‐vibrational coupling, thus facilitating intermolecular photoinduced electron transfer to form PS radical cation and anion via autoionization reaction. Subsequently, these highly oxidizing or reducing PS radicals engage in cascade photoredox to generate efficient ·OH and O2‾·. As a result, C3TH nanoclusters achieve a 97.6% antibacterial efficacy against MRSA at an ultralow dose, surpassing the efficacy of the commercial antibiotic Vancomycin by more than 8.8‐fold. These findings deepen the understanding of Type I PDT, providing a novel strategy for developing Type I PSs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase‐filed simulations, a strategy of controlling the morphology and ordering of Al2O3 fillers in Pb‐based AFE composite ceramics is proposed, aiming to improve its breakdown strength. Significantly improved Eb of 570 kV cm−1 and ultrahigh Wrec of 13.2 J cm−3 are achieved in composite ceramics with parallel‐aligned Al2O3 plates.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors possessing high power density and ultrashort discharge time are valuable for high‐power energy storage applications. However, achieving high energy storage density remains challenging due to the limited breakdown strength of dielectric ceramics. In this study, inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase‐field simulations, a strategy of constructing a nacre‐like layered structure is proposed to improve the breakdown strength and energy storage density of the ceramics. This unique structure is formed by controlling the morphology and ordering of high‐voltage‐resistant fillers in a ceramic matrix. The (Pb0.98La0.02)(Zr0.7Sn0.3)0.995O3‐Al2O3 antiferroelectric composite ceramics, containing 5vol% parallel‐aligned Al2O3 plates, demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in breakdown strength from 390 to 570 kV cm−1. Of particular importance is that an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density of up to 13.2 J cm−3 is achieved, representing a 50% enhancement compared to the pure ceramic (8.7 J cm−3). The parallel‐aligned Al2O3 plates are strongly bound together with the ceramic matrix, effectively blocking charge migration and controlling the breakdown path, thus greatly enhancing the voltage endurance of the composite ceramics. This work provides an innovative approach to designing high‐performance composite ceramics for next‐generation energy storage applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A simple yet intuitive d‐p orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu‐based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono‐carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction—acidic CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu‐based single‐atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu‐based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive d‐p orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu‐based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction‐acidic CO2 electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single‐carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb1Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 ± 2.5% at 200 mA cm−2. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu‐based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh‐performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study explores the synergistic interplay between oxygen reduction reaction and NH4+ storage, and harnesses the synergy for the successful development of a high‐rate and highly stable ammonium ion air battery (AIAB). The assembled AIAB demonstrates outstanding rate performance (89 mAh g−1 at 15 A g−1), high energy density (78 Wh kg−1 at 9369 W kg−1), and exceptional cycling stability at 10 A g−1.








Abstract
Ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) offer cost‐effectiveness, nontoxicity, and eco‐friendly attributes in energy storage technology. However, the constrained capacity and poor stability of conventional cathode materials have impeded their widespread adoption. Herein, a synergistic approach is introduced to overcome these challenges, by enhancing the air cathode with NH4+ and simultaneously leveraging atmospheric oxygen as a reservoir for NH4+ storage. Notably, NH4+ significantly enhances the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in neutral environments. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and quantum density functional theory calculations, it is elucidated how NH4+ can act as a proton donor, replacing H2O in neutral media and reducing energy barriers in the protonation of *O2− and *O, thereby accelerating ORR kinetics. The resulting ammonium ion‐air battery, comprising an air cathode and a polymer (PNP) anode, showcases impressive metrics: high energy density of 78 Wh kg−1 and power density of 9369 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1, an initial capacity of 94.3 mAh g−1 and exceptional cycling stability (70.4% capacity retention after 12 500 cycles) at 10 A g−1. This pioneering research highlights the synergistic relationship between ORR and NH4+ storage and opens up new avenues for the design and advancement of innovative, sustainable, and environment‐friendly AIBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel ionizing radiation‐responsive delivery system is designed for the precise expression of anti‐TREM2 single‐chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy.








Abstract
Preoperative neoadjuvant radio‐chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of low rectal cancer, yet its effectiveness can be limited by the insensitivity of some patients, profoundly impacting their quality of life. Through preliminary research, it is found that TREM2+ macrophages play a pivotal role in the non‐responsiveness to immunotherapy. To address this challenge, a novel ionizing radiation‐responsive delivery system is developed for the precise expression of anti‐TREM2 single‐chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy. The released anti‐TREM2 scFv can be precisely targeted and delivered to the tumor site via the engineered EcN outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing tumor therapeutic efficiency when used in combination with the αPD‐L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, these engineered bacteria can be further modified to enhance the intestinal colonization capabilities through oral administration, thereby regulating the gut microbiota and its metabolic byproducts. Consequently, the ionizing radiation‐responsive drug delivery system based on the engineered bacteria not only introduces a promising new therapeutic option for low rectal cancer but also showcases the potential to finely tune immune responses within the intricate tumor microenvironment, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor radio‐immunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal‐plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.








Abstract
The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal‐plane (Cu‐SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu‐SC in 0.1 m NaOH is reduced to 1.99 × 10−3 mm yr−¹, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 × 10−2 mm yr−¹). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti‐counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu‐SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144 h at 85 °C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles. The enhanced anti‐oxidation properties of Cu‐SC ensure the stability of its microstructures, which are critical for deep learning‐based authentication, allowing precise feature extraction and accurate label verification even under extreme conditions. These results highlight the potential of (111) surface reconstruction for enhancing material stability, enabling advanced anti‐counterfeiting applications, and promoting the sustainable utilization of metallic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A cost‐effective ternary Prussian blue analog is synthesized via structural regulation to achieve the compatibility of high capacity and long lifespan for sodium‐ion batteries within a wide temperature range. Mn and Cu synergistically enhances conductivity, operating voltage, and stability, suppressing Jahn–Teller distortions. This design enables high‐loading 18650‐type cells with exceptional electrochemical performance, supporting grid‐scale energy storage.








Abstract
High‐performance, cost‐effective cathodes are essential for grid‐scale sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) have shown great potential as SIB cathodes, but achieving both high capacity and long lifespan remains challenging. In this study, a series of low‐cost ternary PBAs synthesized through structural regulation is presented to simultaneously achieve high capacity, stable cycling performance, and broad temperature adaptability. Among them, CuHCF‐3 demonstrates a specific capacity of 132.4 mAh g−1 with 73.3% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. In‐depth analyses, using in situ techniques and density functional theory calculations, reveal a highly reversible three‐phase transition (monoclinic ↔ cubic ↔ tetragonal) in Na1.96Cu0.45Mn0.55[Fe(CN)6]0.91·□0.09·2.14H2O (CuHCF‐3), which is driven by synergistic interactions between Mn and Cu. Mn enhances conductivity, increases the operating voltage, and introduces additional redox centers, while Cu mitigates the Jahn–Teller distortions associated with Mn and buffers volume changes during cycling. This structural synergy results in excellent temperature stability across a wide temperature range (−20 to 55 °C). 18650‐type cylindrical cells based on CuHCF‐3 with high loading density achieve 73.54% capacity retention over 850 cycles. This study offers valuable insights for designing durable, high‐capacity electrode materials for SIB energy storage applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The peptide‐oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5‐P7‐R9‐(G‐DOPA)4‐HPGGPQ‐H8‐C‐DBCO and miRNA‐124‐A5‐(CH2)6‐Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.









Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region‐targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.

<title>Revisiting the “Stick‐Slip” Process via Magnetism‐Coupled Flexible Sensors with Bioinspired Ridge Architecture</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A sandwich‐like device for stick‐slip perception is developed, featuring a deformable bioinspired ridge layer with capability of lateral deformation and fast recovery. Coupled with magnetized functionality, the morphological transformation is capable to induce periodical electrical pulses which allows to revisit the stick‐slip process when human fingertip scans across a specific surface.








Abstract
“Stick‐slip” phenomenon that occurs when human fingertip scans across a specific surface is essential to perceive the interactions between skin and the surface. Understanding the “stick‐slip” behavior is important for bionic flexible system in applications from advanced robotics to intelligent tactile sensors. However, it is often overlooked owing to the limitations to mimic the soft skin that can tangentially deform/recover with informative electrical feedback. Here, a sandwich‐type device with deformable ridge‐layer is proposed to analyze the characteristic of stick/slip states in “stick‐slip” process. Specifically, it is observed that fast recovery of the sensing architecture is caused by dynamic slip phase that generates periodical signals based on principle of induction. The results experimentally show that periods of the electrical pulses are dependent on factors such as inherent properties (e.g., modulus and geometry) and operational parameters (e.g., scanning speed and normal load), which is consistent with the theoretical model. Furthermore, it is found that the transition between “stick‐slip” and full slip could qualitatively reflect interfacial properties such as moisture, roughness, and topology. It is expected that the results can strengthen the understanding of “stick‐slip” behavior when fingertip interacts with a surface and provide guidance of flexible sensor design to enrich the biomimetic perceptions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The air‐operated assembly of aqueous Fe‐ion batteries is realized by a very unexpected finding when excess acid is introduced into the traditional aqueous FeSO4 electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism for the as‐detected ultra‐low dissolved O2 and reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell is revealed.








Abstract
Fe2+ have emerged as the ideal charge carriers to construct aqueous batteries as one of the most competitive candidates for next‐generation low‐cost and safe energy storage. Unfortunately, the fast oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ at ambient conditions inevitably requires the assembly process of the cells in an oxygen‐free glovebox. Up to date, direct air assembly of aqueous Fe‐ion battery remains very desirable yet highly challenge. Here oxidation of Fe2+ is found at ambient condition and is completely inhibited in an acidic electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is revealed with reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell for this unexpected finding. Based on this surprise, for the first time, air‐operated assembly of iron‐ion batteries is realized. Meanwhile, it is found that the acidic environment induces the in situ growth of active α‐FeOOH derivate on the VOPO4·2H2O surface. Strikingly, the acidic electrolyte enables an air‐operated Fe‐ion battery with a high specific capacity of 192 mAh g−1 and ultrastable cycling stability over 1300 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. This work makes a break through on the air‐assembly of Fe‐ion battery without oxygen‐free glovebox. It also reveals previously unknown proton/O2 competitive mechanisms in the Fe2+ solvated shell and cathode surface chemistry for aqueous Fe2+ storage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Centimeter‐scale arrays of single nanoparticles, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography or Polymer Pen Lithography, allow for the discovery of novel nanomaterials at an unprecedented scale. The development of phase‐separating hydrophobic nanoreactors bypasses element‐specific chemistry limitations, enabling the synthesis of polyelemental metal and metal oxide nanoparticle megalibraries from at least 52 metal elements with an almost infinite number of chemical combinations in a single experiment.








Abstract
Phase‐separating nanoreactors, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN) or Polymer Pen Lithography (PPL) and capable of single nanoparticle formation, are compatible with almost every relevant element from the periodic table. This advance overcomes one of the most daunting limitations in high throughput materials discovery, specifically enabling the synthesis of broad swaths of the materials genome. Indeed, the platform is compatible with at least 52 metal elements of interest and almost an infinite number of combinations. In particular, it is discovered that surface‐confined, attoliter‐volume reactors made of polystyrene (PS) mixtures can be preloaded with metal salts spanning all but the alkali metals and subsequently transformed into single‐ or multi‐component nanoparticles of well‐defined dimensions. This is done in a three‐step process, which initially involves the facilitation of precursor precipitation and localization with toluene vapor, followed by plasma treatment to remove the polymer reactor component, and then heating from 400–900 °C, depending upon precursor and desired end‐state (degree of reduction and crystallinity). These phase‐separating nanoreactors are used to produce metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, depending upon conditions, in a substrate‐general manner.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The low plating‐stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next‐generation Fe‐ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl2 to the FeCl2‐based electrolyte makes the solid‐electrolyte interphase‐enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.








Abstract
Iron is a promising candidate for a cost‐effective anode for large‐scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well‐established mass production. Recently, Fe‐ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid‐electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl2 and ZnCl2 as cosalts, where the Zn‐Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl2 allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much‐improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Hybrid materials with enhanced photostability and photothermal properties are prepared by modifying gold nanorods with tailored organic dyes, where plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation are effectively combined. Using the materials as a reusable energy converter, localized, and controllable photothermal crystallization of biorelevant mineral salts, including NaCl, CaCO3, BaCO3, and SrCO3, is realized using 638 nm laser light.








Abstract
Well‐designed nanomaterials with favorable photothermal performance are beneficial for exploring fascinating and prospective applications. Herein the facile and effective way is reported to enhance photothermal properties of gold nanorods (GNRs) through immobilizing tailored organic dyes around GNRs. Benefitting from the combination of plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation, the modified GNRs exhibit a temperature increase of >100 °C under 638 nm laser irradiation in film state, which is double of that of the bare GNRs‐doped film under the same condition. The hybrid film also exhibits superior stability and reusability compared to the film only doped with the dyes. Surface temperature of the hybrid film can be adjusted from 31 to 116 °C by tunning either doping materials concentration or light power. Interestingly, the hybrid film serves as a reusable energy converter in confined and controllable photothermal crystallization of mineral salts. NaCl crystals can be arranged into different patterns by moving the laser probe during the crystallization. Microcrystals of CaCO3 (calcite, vaterite, and aragonite), BaCO3, and SrCO3 are successfully obtained. It is believed that the as‐prepared materials as well as the demonstrated photothermal crystallization will contribute to the development of function‐led photothermal materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A unique electrocatalyst featuring singly dispersed Pt–Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, which confers exceptional activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, enabling high‐performance anion‐exchange‐membrane water electrolyser, is reported. Real‐time monitoring reveals that these sites self‐adaptively distort under operating conditions to form a Pt1Co6 configuration with strongly negative charge, optimizing reactant binding and reorganizing the interfacial water structure.








Abstract
Metallizing active sites to control the structural and kinetic dissociation of water at the catalyst–electrolyte interface, along with elucidating its mechanism under operating conditions, is a pivotal innovation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a design of singly dispersed Pt–Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, tailored for HER, is introduced. An anion‐exchange‐membrane water electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst can achieve the industrial current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm−2 at 1.71 and 1.85 V, respectively. It is revealed that the singly dispersed Pt–Co sites undergo self‐adaptive distortion under operating conditions, which form a Pt1Co6 configuration with a strongly negative charge that optimizes reactant binding and reorganizes the interfacial water structure, resulting in an improved concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the closest ion plane. The K+ ions interact cooperatively with H2O (K·H2O), which strengthens the Pt–H binding interaction and facilitates the polarization of the H─OH bond, leading to improved HER activity. This study not only propels the advancement of cathodic catalysts for water electrolysis but also delineates a metallization strategy and an interface design principle, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic reaction rates.

By connecting CoTPyP blocks with transition metal nodes, a class of bimetallic 2D MOFs are designed and synthesized. The prepared CoTPyP‐M MOFs enhanced the utilization of sulfur and smoothed the lithium deposition/stripping process. The central Co sites display strong interactions with sulfur species through Co−S and Li−N bonds, facilitating the cleavage of S−S bond from both ends and promoting their conversion kinetics in Li−S batteries.








Abstract
Developing the highly efficient catalysts is a great challenge for accelerating the redox reactions in Li−S batteries. Inspired by the single‐atom catalysts and metalloproteins, it makes full use of the advantages of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts. Herein, a series of 2D metal‐bonded metalloporphyrin MOFs are prepared with 5,10,15,20‐tetrakis(4‐pyridyl) cobalt porphyrin (CoTPyP) as building blocks and transition metals (M═Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) as nodes, respectively. The crystalline structures of the bimetallic 2D MOFs are confirmed by UV–vis spectra and X‐ray diffraction analyses. According to DFT calculation, the peripheral metal nodes optimize the electronic state of Co in porphyrin core. Especially, CoTPyP‐Mn facilitates the cleavage of S−S bond from both ends and promotes their conversion kinetics through Co−S and Li−N bonds. The Li−S cells with CoTPyP‐Mn show the initial specific capacity of 1339 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C. The capacity decay rate is only 0.0442% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 2 C. This work achieves the rational control of the central Co d electron state through the peripheral regulation and enriches the application of MOFs in accelerating the redox kinetics in Li−S batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Chemically bonded conductive metal‐organic framework/polyoxometalate composites are synthesized as a high‐performance bifunctional electrocatalyst through a conserved ligand replacement strategy. Excellent performances with a H2O2 production rate of 9.51 mol gcat−1 h−1 and 2, 5‐furandicarboxylic acid yield of 96.8% are achieved in an integrated electrolysis system of two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction coupling with 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The design of bifunctional and high‐performance electrocatalysts that can be used as both cathodes and anodes for the two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) and biomass valorization is attracting increasing attention. Herein, a conserved ligand replacement strategy is developed for the synthesis of highly ordered conductive metal‐organic frameworks (Ni‐HITP, HITP = 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11‐hexaiminotriphenylene) with chemically confined phosphotungstic acid (PW12) nanoclusters in the nanopores. The newly formed Ni−O−W bonds in the resultant Ni‐HITP/PW12 electrocatalysts modulate the electronic structures of both Ni and W sites, which are favorable for cathodic 2e− ORR to H2O2 production and anodic 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to 2, 5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), respectively. In combination with the deliberately retained conductive frameworks and ordered pores, the dual‐functional Ni‐HITP/PW12 composites enable a H2O2 production rate of 9.51 mol gcat−1 h−1 and an FDCA yield of 96.8% at a current density of 100 mA cm−2/cell voltage of 1.38 V in an integrated 2e− ORR/HMFOR system, significantly improved than the traditional 2e− ORR/oxygen evolution reaction system. This work has provided new insights into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and electrocatalytic systems for the green synthesis of valuable chemicals.

This is a quasi‐dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI), which can be effectively used to fabricate high‐quality twisted heterostructures, including monolayer/few‐layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal‐like heterostructure. It also enables the fabrication of suspended 2DMs and high‐performance devices. This technique features excellent scalability, advancing fundamental research on 2DMs, and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.









Abstract
Transfer technique has become an indispensable process in the development of two‐dimensional materials (2DMs) and their heterostructures, as it determines the quality of the interface and the performance of the resulting devices. However, how to flexibly and conveniently fabricate two‐dimensional (2D) twisted heterostructures with high‐quality interfaces has always been a formidable challenge. Here, a quasi‐dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI) is developed, which can be flexibly used to fabricate twisted heterostructures. This method leverages a charged hydrophilic surface to facilitate WVI at the interface, enabling the clean and uniform detachment of 2DMs from the substrate. Using this method, the twisted monolayer/few‐layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal‐like WS2/MoS2, highlighting the surface/interface cleanness and angle‐controlled transfer method is successfully fabricated. Besides, suspended structures of these 2DMs and heterostructures are fabricated, which offers substantial convenience for studying their intrinsic physical properties. Further, a high‐performance hBN/graphene/hBN superlattice device with the mobility of ≈199,000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature is fabricated. This transfer technique ingeniously combines the advantages of dry transfer and wet transfer. Moreover, it features excellent scalability, providing crucial technical support for future research on the fundamental physical properties of 2DMs and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.

<title>p‐π Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks Expedite Molecular Triplet Excitons for H2O2 Production Coupled with Biomass Upgrading</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A fluorinated olefin‐linked triazine covalent organic framework photocatalyst is developed. The adjacent fluorine atom‐olefinic bond forms p–π conjugation and expedites triplet excitons for activating O2 to 1O2 while accelerating charge separation, thus leading to high‐efficiency photocatalytic O2 reduction to H2O2 and 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural photo‐oxidation upgrading.








Abstract
High‐efficiency production of triplet states in covalent organic framework photocatalysts is crucial for high‐selectivity oxygen (O2) reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, fluorine and partial fluorine atoms are incorporated into an olefin‐linked triazine covalent organic framework (F‐ol‐COF and HF‐ol‐COF), in which the adjacent fluorine (F) atoms‐olefinic bond forms p‐π conjugation that induces spin‐polarization under irradiation, thus expediting triplet excitons for activating O2 to singlet oxygen (1O2) and contributing to a high H2O2 selectivity (91%). Additionally, the feasibility of coupling H2O2 production with the valorization of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is exhibited. The F‐ol‐COF demonstrates a highly stable H2O2 yield rate of 12558 µmol g−1 h−1 with the HMF‐to‐functionalized furan conversion yield of 95%, much higher than the partially fluorinated COF (HF‐ol‐COF) and the non‐fluorinated COF (H‐ol‐COF). Mechanistic studies reveal that F‐incorporation promotes charge separation, intensifies the Lewis acidity of the carbon atoms on the olefinic bond as active sites for O2 adsorption, and provides highly concentrated holes at the triazine unit for HMF oxidation upgrading. This study suggests the attractive potential of rational design of porous‐crystalline photocatalysts for high‐efficiency photocatalytic O2 reduction to H2O2 and biomass upgrading.

<title>Preventing Benzoquinone‐Based Catalyst Aggregation Enables the One‐Step Synthesis of Highly Conductive Poly(benzodifurandione) without Post‐Reaction Purification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
α‐Tocopherylquinone (α‐TQ), the oxidation product of α‐tocopherol (α‐TOH), catalyzes the oxidative polymerization of 3,7‐dihydrobenzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐b′]difuran‐2,6‐dione (HBFDO). The saturated aliphatic chiral side chain of α‐TQ suppresses its crystallization, enabling high‐conductivity polymer ink without needing post‐polymerization dialysis. This scalable method, tested in a 20 L reactor, yields ready‐to‐use poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) ink.








Abstract
Conductive polymers have become crucial in advancing various electronic applications. While p‐type materials like poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) are widely used and produced at scale, the development of high‐performance n‐type polymers has lagged due to challenges in synthesis and scalability. In this work, a novel method is introduced to synthesize the highly conductive n‐type polymer poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) using α‐tocopherylquinone (α‐TQ) as a catalyst. This approach eliminates the need for post‐reaction dialysis, a major obstacle to large‐scale PBFDO production. By preventing catalyst aggregation, high electrical conductivity (>1320 S cm−1) is achieved, which remains stable in air for over 180 d, significantly simplifying the process. The α‐TQ‐synthesized PBFDO also exhibits excellent thermoelectric properties, with a power factor exceeding 100 µW m−1 K−2, placing it among the highest‐performing n‐type thermoelectric polymers. Additionally, residual α‐TQ acts as a plasticizer, reducing the elastic modulus by over tenfold while maintaining high conductivity, making this material suitable for mechanically compliant electronics. Similarly, residual α‐TQ lowers the thermal conductivity of PBFDO by more than an order of magnitude. The process is scalable, as demonstrated by producing high‐conductivity ink in a 20 L reactor. This work presents an efficient and sustainable approach for large‐scale n‐type polymer production.

<title>A 2D/3D Heterostructure Perovskite Solar Cell with a Phase‐Pure and Pristine 2D Layer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A simple solution‐based method that can achieve pristine (without residual 2D precursors) and phase‐pure 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure without the need for synthesizing a single crystal is developed. Perovskite solar cells with this treatment demonstrate a notable improvement in both power conversion efficiency and long‐term stability, with negligible hysteresis, compared to the conventional process.








Abstract
Interface engineering plays a critical role in advancing the performance of perovskite solar cells. As such, 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures are of particular interest due to their optoelectrical properties and their further potential improvements. However, for conventional solution‐processed 2D perovskites grown on an underlying 3D perovskite, the reaction stoichiometry is normally unbalanced with excess precursors. Moreover, the formed 2D perovskite is impure, leading to unfavorable energy band alignment at the interface. Here a simple method is presented that solves both issues simultaneously. The 2D formation reaction is taken first to completion, fully consuming excess PbI2. Then, isopropanol is utilized to remove excess organic ligands, control the 2D perovskite thickness, and obtain a phase‐pure, n = 2, 2D perovskite. The outcome is a pristine (without residual 2D precursors) and phase‐pure 2D perovskite heterostructure with improved surface passivation and charge carrier extraction compared to the conventional solution process. PSCs incorporating this treatment demonstrate a notable improvement in both stability and power conversion efficiency, with negligible hysteresis, compared to the conventional process.

This work reports an OPECT‐based chemical MSI with multisensory perception, multimodal synaptic plasticity, and typical MSI features in electrolytes. The advanced MSI device is then used to mimic the associative learning and reflex activities of visual and gustatory stimuli with the associated feedback loops. This work may provide new insight into the development of highly biomimetic MSI in biological fluids for seamless neuro‐robotic systems.









Abstract
Neuromorphic perception capable of multisensory integration (MSI) in electrolytes is important but remains challenging. Here, the aqueous implementation of artificial MSI is reported based on the newly emerged organic photoelectrochemical transistor (OPECT) by representative visual (light)‐gustatory (sour) perception. Under the co‐modulation of light and H+/OH−, multisensory synaptic plasticity and several typical MSI characteristics are mimicked, including “super‐additive response,” “inverse effectiveness effect” and “temporal congruency.” To demonstrate its potential usage, different types of multisensory associative learning and corresponding reflex activities are further emulated. The chemical MSI system is also utilized to control artificial salivation by a closed loop of real‐time perception, processing, integration, and actuation to emulate the biological responses toward external stimuli. In contrast to previous solid‐state operations, this work offers a new strategy for developing neuromorphic MSI in aqueous environments that are analogous to those in biology.

<title>Giant Non‐Saturating Exchange Striction in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High‐quality single crystals of the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn are synthesized, and a non‐saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400 ppm under 57 T is observed, surpassing the giant magnetostriction materials such as FeGa. The theoretical analyses indicate that this pronounced non‐saturating magnetostriction stems from an exotic exchange striction mechanism, which facilitates a linear relationship between strain output and applied magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetostriction, discovered by Joule in 1842, refers to the mechanical strain that a material undergoes in the presence of a magnetic field. Conventionally, it originates from the spin‐orbit coupling and has been predominantly explored in ferromagnets. In this work, a giant magnetostriction effect is reported in the high‐quality single crystal of a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Non‐saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400 ppm is obtained, which is even larger than the saturation values of the well‐known Fe‐based giant magnetostriction ferromagnetic materials such as FeGa. Theoretical calculations reveal that the large non‐saturating magnetostriction results from a sophisticated exchange striction effect of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure, leading to a nearly linear dependence of the strain output on the applied magnetic field. This work provides an unprecedented strategy to design next‐generation magnetoelastic materials with noncollinear compensated spin structures.

This research introduces an innovative octahedron‐like cobalt structure embedded in hierarchical porous nanofibers, significantly optimizing hydrogen peroxide production in acidic environments. Achieving 80% faradaic efficiency at 400 mA cm−2 and maintaining stable operation over 120 h at 100 mA cm−2, this approach provides a scalable and sustainable pathway to enhance industrial hydrogen peroxide generation.








Abstract
Electrochemically generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen offers a more sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to conventional anthraquinone process. In alkaline conditions, H2O2 is unstable as HO2−, and in neutral electrolytes, alkali cation crossover causes system instability. Producing H2O2 in acidic electrolytes ensures enhanced stability and efficiency. However, in acidic conditions, the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism is dominated by the inner‐sphere electron transfer pathway, requiring careful consideration of both reaction and mass transfer kinetics. These stringent requirements limit H2O2 production efficiency, typically below 10–20% at industrial‐relevant current densities (>300 mA cm−2). Using a multiscale approach that combines active site tuning with macrostructure tuning, this work presents an octahedron‐like cobalt structure on interconnected hierarchical porous nanofibers, achieving a faradaic efficiency exceeding 80% at 400 mA cm−2 and stable operation for over 120 h at 100 mA cm−2. At 300 mA cm−2, the optimized catalyst demonstrates a cell potential of 2.14 V, resulting in an energy efficiency of 26%.

High‐aspect‐ratio cationic nanocellulose self‐assembles into mechanically robust nanomesh architectures at oil‐water interfaces through charge‐directed assembly. The resulting structures feature uniform “breathing holes” (≈34 nm) enabling efficient mass transfer. When applied to oxidative desulfurization, the system achieves >90% thiophene removal under ambient conditions with exceptional catalyst stability through multiple cycles.








Abstract
Liquid–liquid interfaces present unique opportunities for sustainable biphasic catalysis, yet concurrent amplification of molecular transport and reactivity at these boundaries remains challenging. Here it is demonstrated that high‐aspect‐ratio cationic nanocellulose (HNC+) spontaneously self‐assembles into mechanically robust nanomesh architectures at oil‐water interfaces through charge‐directed assembly. This assembly is driven by electrostatic attraction between the cationic nanofibers and the intrinsic negative charge at hydrophobic‐aqueous interfaces (σ ≈−0.3 C m−2), generating sufficient excess attractive force (ΔU ≈−1,200 kBT) to overcome image charge repulsion. The resulting nanomesh exhibits uniform “breathing holes” (≈34 nm) and exceptional stability under extreme conditions (pH 2–13, 1.8 m NaCl, and 90 °C). When applied to oxidative desulfurization, the system achieves >90% thiophene removal under ambient conditions with exceptional atom economy (E‐factor < 1.1) and catalyst stability through multiple cycles. This breakthrough strategy for interfacial engineering using renewable materials opens new possibilities for green chemical manufacturing while providing fundamental insights into charge‐mediated assembly at liquid interfaces. These findings establish a viable pathway for sustainable heterogeneous catalysis that aligns with circular economy principles.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review comprehensively elaborates on functional groups‐regulated OSCs that enhance photocatalytic H2O2 production performance, such as cyano, imine, hydroxyl, carboxyl, anthraquinone, sulfonic acid, halogen, etc. Functional groups containing O, N, and S elements contribute to increased charge separation and lower energy barriers for intermediate formation, ultimately enhancing the rate of photocatalytic H2O2 production.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly reagent, and organic semiconductors (OSCs) are ideal photocatalysts for the synthesis of H2O2 due to their well‐defined molecular structure, strong donor‐acceptor interactions, and efficient charge separation. This review discusses the regulatory mechanisms of functional group modifications in tuning the photocatalytic performance of OSCs, highlighting the relationship between functional group structure and catalytic performance. For example, electron‐regulating groups, such as cyano and halogen, induce molecular dipoles, facilitating the migration of photogenerated electrons. Fluorine groups optimize the band structure and prolong carrier lifetime due to their high electronegativity. π‐Conjugated extension groups, like anthraquinone and thiophene, expand conjugation, improve visible light capture, and stabilize intermediates through redox cycles. Hydroxyl groups enhance surface hydrophilicity and promote H2O activation, while imine bond protonation adjusts charge distribution and improves selectivity and cycle stability. Multi‐active site functional groups, such as sulfonic acid and amide, accelerate reaction kinetics and inhibit H2O2 decomposition. Functional groups enhance light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactions through electronic structure regulation, intermediate adsorption optimization, and proton‐electron transfer. Future work should integrate machine learning to identify optimal functional group combinations and develop green functionalization strategies for efficient H2O2 photocatalyst synthesis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Comprehensive analysis of the existing and prospective sodium‐ion battery (SIB) systems unveils that a wider application of SIBs should primarily focus on i) regulating the composition, morphology, surface chemistry, safety performance, and production feasibility of mainstream cathodes, ii) enhancing the high‐voltage stability, film formation ability, and cost effectiveness of electrolytes, and iii) reducing irreversible capacity loss and interphase growth of hard carbon anodes based on well‐understood sodium‐ion storage mechanisms.








Abstract
Lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) have been widely adopted in the automotive industry, with an annual global production exceeding 1000 GWh. Despite their success, the escalating demand for LIBs has created concerns on supply chain issues related to key elements, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are emerging as a promising alternative due to the high abundance and low cost of sodium and other raw materials. Nevertheless, the commercialization of SIBs, particularly for grid storage and automotive applications, faces significant hurdles. This perspective article aims to identify the critical challenges in making SIBs viable from both chemical and techno‐economic perspectives. First, a brief comparison of the materials chemistry, working mechanisms, and cost between mainstream LIB systems and prospective SIB systems is provided. The intrinsic challenges of SIBs regarding storage stability, capacity utilization, cycle stability, calendar life, and safe operation of cathode, electrolyte, and anode materials are discussed. Furthermore, issues related to the scalability of material production, materials engineering feasibility, and energy‐dense electrode design and fabrication are illustrated. Finally, promising pathways are listed and discussed toward achieving high‐energy‐density, stable, cost‐effective SIBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Muscles represent one of the toughest anisotropic soft matters. The appealing features originate from their unique aligned fiber‐based structures, which form via a combining process involving two major essentials: absorbing nutrients for matrix growth and mechanical training to strengthen the matrix. In this work, a mechanical training‐associated growing strategy is proposed to mimic this process for preparing tough anisotropic hydrogels with tunable sizes and enhanced mechanical properties.








Abstract
Muscles are highly anisotropic, force‐bearing issues. They form via a process involving nutrient absorption for matrix growth and mechanical training for matrix toughening, in which cyclic disassembly‐reconstruction of muscle fibers plays a critical role in generating strong anisotropic structures. Inspired by this process, a mechanical training‐associated growing strategy is developed for preparing tough anisotropic hydrogels. Using anisotropic hydrogels made from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/tannic acid (TA) as an example, it is demonstrated that the hydrogels can absorb poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) via disassembling their aligned nanofibrillar structures. Incorporation of PEGDA within the hydrogels induces PVA to form crystal domains while subsequent mechanical training can restore the aligned fibrillar structures. Such a combining process results in expansion in materials’ size (≈2 times) and significant enhancement in their mechanical properties (Young's modulus: from 2.4 to 2.85 MPa; ultimate tensile strength: from 8.2 to 14.1 MPa; toughness: from 335 to 465 MJ m−3). With a high energy dissipation efficiency (≈0%), potential applications for these tough and adaptable hydrogels are envisioned in impact‐protective materials, surgical sutures, etc.

The charge transfer mechanism and hydrogen evolution reaction photocatalytic reaction mechanism are determined by using transient absorption spectrum, electromagnetic simulation, in situ Raman, and density functional theory theoretical calculation.








Abstract
Plasmonic metal–semiconductor nanocomposites are promising candidates for considerably enhancing the solar‐to‐hydrogen conversion efficiency of semiconductor‐based photocatalysts across the entire solar spectrum. However, the underlying enhancement mechanism remains unclear, and the overall efficiency is still low. Herein, a hollow C@MoS2‐Au@CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst is developed to achieve improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) across a broad spectral range. Transient absorption spectroscopy experiments and electromagnetic field simulations demonstrate that compared to the treated sample, the untreated sample exhibits a high density of sulfur vacancies. Consequently, under near‐field enhancement, photogenerated electrons from CdS and hot electrons generated by intra‐band or inter‐band transitions of Au nanoparticles are efficiently transferred to the CdS surface, thus significantly improving the HER activity of CdS. Additionally, in situ, Raman spectroscopy provided spectral evidence of S─H intermediate species on the CdS surface during the HER process, which is verified through isotope experiments. Density functional theory simulations identify sulfur atoms in CdS as the catalytic active sites for HER. These findings enhance the understanding of charge transfer mechanisms and HER pathways, offering valuable insights for the design of plasmonic photocatalysts with enhanced efficiency.

Here, a deep‐HOMO level p‐type small molecule, (2‐(3,6‐dibromo‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid, constructs a better‐balanced carrier injection due to improved hole and retarded electron injection by spontaneously centered at the bottom and top surfaces of perovskites films, along with modulation of all defects in bulk and at surface of doped films due to the formation of covalent bonds. With this approach a series of blue perovskite LEDs with external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.03% (485 nm), 16.61% (476 nm), and 8.55% (467 nm) is designed.








Abstract
Unbalanced charge carrier injections and high densities of non‐radiative recombination channels are still major obstacles to advancing high‐efficiency blue perovskite light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, a deep‐HOMO level p‐type small molecule, (2‐(3,6‐dibromo‐9H‐carbazol‐9‐yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid, doped in blue perovskites for building a better‐balanced injection and controlling over defects is demonstrated. During the perovskite film deposition process, most small molecules are extruded from the precursor solution to the bottom and top surfaces of the perovskite films. This unique distribution of molecules can construct a better‐balanced carrier injection due to improved hole and retarded electron injection by its suitable energy‐level structure, along with modulation of all defects in bulk and at the surface of doped films due to the formation of covalent bonds by its functional moiety. With this approach, a series of blue perovskite LEDs is designed with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 24.03% (at a luminance of 113 cd m−2 and emission peak of 485 nm), 16.61% (at a luminance of 51 cd m−2 and emission peak of 476 nm) and 8.55% (at a luminance of 30 cd m−2 and emission perk of 467 nm), and encouraging operational stability.

a) Schematic of all‐silicon photodetectors with in‐plane photon trapping structures (IPTS). b) Comparison of peak specific detectivity in IPTS photodetectors with previously reported very long‐wavelength infrared photodetectors.








Abstract
Silicon (Si) photonics has been widely explored for many various applications, including optical communication, optoelectronic computing, spectroscopy, and image sensing. As a key component for optoelectronic signal conversion in these applications, Si‐based infrared photodetectors have attracted extensive attention. However, achieving all‐Si on‐chip photodetection in the very long‐wavelength infrared (VLWIR) range remains challenging, with broadband enhancement and improved operating temperature being pressing issues that need to be addressed. An all‐Si photodetector design is presented using in‐plane photon trapping structures (IPTS) to enhance detection efficiency and improve the operating temperature of the photodetector at the VLWIR range. The photodetector achieves a broadband enhancement of 285–575% (across 12–19 µm) and a 31% reduction in dark current. Additionally, it exhibits an impressive peak specific detectivity of 1.9 × 1010 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at 15 µm, operating at a temperature of 40 K. This study introduces a novel all‐Si optoelectronic device architecture that offers a promising solution for improving the operating temperature and sensitivity of broadband VLWIR devices, making the whole system more compact and cost‐effective.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An in‐liquid superspreading space‐confined epitaxy approach is proposed to fabricate Pt (II) complexes crystalline films on superamphiphilic surface. By regulation of the diffusion process, precise control over the nucleation and crystal growth is achieved, resulting in the formation of planar crystalline films. These films exhibit multi‐signal sensing ability, making them suitable for reaffirmed sensing detector in complex and unstable conditions.








Abstract
Solution‐based method is regarded as a promising approach to fabricate large‐area, high‐quality crystalline films, owing to its low‐cost manufacturing and facile features. However, traditional solution‐based methods still suffer from random simultaneous nucleation and uncontrollable crystal growth which result in polycrystalline films and coffee‐ring effect. Herein, it is proposed that an in‐liquid superspreading space‐confined epitaxy approach on a superamphiphilic surface to fabricate crystalline films with controllable initial nucleation and crystal morphology. With delicate control of the liquid environment, concentration, and superspreading space‐confined solvent film thickness, planar crystalline films with high crystallinity and smooth morphology are obtained. A controllable dewetting crystallization mechanism is proposed, indicating that the diffusion coefficient, regulated by liquid environment, can control the dewetting process during crystallization. With the balance of solvent diffusion and solute precipitation in crystallization, the ordered in‐plane and out‐of‐plane molecular stacking is achieved. And the as‐prepared planar Pt(II) complex crystalline film exhibits multi‐signal sensing ability, which can be further used to fabricate the reaffirmed sensing detector for precise gas sensing in complex and unstable conditions. This study demonstrates a facile approach for crystalline film fabrication with controllable nucleation and morphology in a liquid environment, which holds promising applications in the construction of oxygen or water‐sensitive organic/inorganic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study employs multi‐objective kernel‐based Bayesian optimization to efficiently screen ionic polymer electrolytes (IPEs) for high‐voltage, fast‐charging lithium metal batteries (LMBs). By examining just 2.8% of the complex chemical space, it achieves multi‐objective optimization for ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and capacity in IPEs. These findings highlight the pivotal role of machine learning in expediting material discovery for advanced batteries.








Abstract
Designing ionic polymer electrolytes (IPEs) for high‐voltage and fast‐charging lithium batteries involves searching in a highly complex and discrete chemical space. Traditional material discovery processes struggle with this complexity due to high costs and long evaluation time. A kernel‐based Bayesian optimization is described to complete the multi‐objective optimization by considering ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and discharge capacity simultaneously. According to a recommender based on a union set of acquisition functions, promising IPEs through three iterations with only 2.8% of the chemical space is targeted. The achieved lithium metal batteries exhibit promising performance with ultrahigh cutoff voltage with NCM811 (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, 4.8 V) and LNMO (LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, 4.92 V). To further extend the versatility of IPEs and diminish the high cost associated with the glove‐box environment, an aqueous and high‐voltage lithium‐ion battery is developed by introducing water molecules in IPEs coupled with Li4Ti5O12||LiMn2O4, a strong hydrogen bonding network formed between the rigid‐rod polyelectrolyte and the embedded water molecules, which effectively suppresses the water reactivity, meanwhile boosting the ionic conductivity. This work reveals an innovative multi‐objective optimization that effectively handles multi‐targets and discontinuous parameter space, offering critical insights to address complex challenges in material discovery and property optimization for advanced and versatile lithium batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
POctS is an innovative, simple to prepare mRNA delivery carrier that has both high mRNA delivery efficiency and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)‐stimulating function. More importantly, the unique site‐specific delivery ability of POctS achieves mRNA expression in specific sites and the exertion of STING‐stimulating function in specific sites, resulting in minimization of formulation toxicity and maximization of mRNA vaccine efficacy.








Abstract
The development of mRNA delivery carriers with innate immune stimulation functions has emerged as a focal point in the field of mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the expression of mRNA in specific sites and innate immune stimulation at specific sites are prerequisites for ensuring the safety of mRNA vaccines. Based on the synthetic PEIRs carriers library, this study identifies an innovative mRNA delivery carrier named POctS with the following characteristics: 1) simultaneously possessing high mRNA delivery efficiency and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) stimulation function. 2) Leveraging the distinctive site‐specific delivery capabilities of POctS, the expression of mRNA at specific sites and the activation of innate immune responses at designated sites are achieved, minimizing formulation toxicity and maximizing the vaccine performance. 3) Tailoring two types of mRNA vaccines based on POctS according to the immune infiltration status of different types of tumors. Briefly, POctS‐loading ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA as a tumor antigen vaccine achieves the prevention and treatment of melanoma in mice. Further, POctS‐loading mixed lineage kinase domain‐like protein (MLKL) mRNA as an in situ tumor vaccine effectively treats orthotopic pancreatic cancer in mice. This delivery carrier offers a feasible mRNA vaccine‐based immunotherapy strategy for various types of tumors.

<title>Orbital Angular Momentum Correlated Charge to Spin Conversion in Metallic Antiferromagnet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Orbital angular momentum (OAM) generated via interfacial orbital Rashba–Edelstein effect is demonstrated to significantly enhance the SOT efficiency in metallic antiferromagnet IrMn‐based heterostructures. The SOT efficiency variation with IrMn thickness reveals the orbital current transportation and conversion process in IrMn. The OAM contribution is verified by the critical current density decreasing of SOT‐driven magnetization switching.








Abstract
Current‐induced spin‐orbit torque (SOT) allows efficient electrical manipulation on magnetization in spintronic devices. Maximizing the SOT efficiency is a key goal that is pursued via increasing the net spin generation and accumulation. However, spin transport in antiferromagnets is seriously restricted due to the strong antiferromagnetic coupling, which blocks the development of antiferromagnetic‐based devices. Here, a significant enhancement of SOT efficiency in Ir20Mn80 (IrMn)‐based heterostructure associated with the orbital effect of naturally oxidized Cu (Cu*) bottom layer is reported. Considering the weak spin–orbit coupling of Cu*, the enhancement results from an orbital current generated from charge current at the Cu*/IrMn interface that contributes to spin current in the IrMn layer due to the strong spin–orbit coupling. The SOT efficiency variation with IrMn thickness reveals the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transportation and conversion. Moreover, the contribution of orbital current is verified by the critical current density decreasing of SOT‐driven magnetization switching in Cu*/IrMn/[Co/Pt]3 heterostructure. This study opens a path to design high‐efficient SOT‐based spintronic devices combining the advantages of OAM and metallic antiferromagnets.

<title>Integrating Strong Luminescence and High Mobility in Organic Single Crystals of Covalent Pyrene Dimers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Both high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY = 72.17%) and high hole mobility (µ = 32.6 cm2 V−1 s−1) are simultaneously harvested in the single crystal of covalent pyrene dimer, which is substantially ascribed to the strong emission from intramolecular hybridized local and charge−transfer state and the 2D charge transport enabled by the intermolecular uniform herringbone stacking.








Abstract
Simultaneously achieving strong luminescence and high mobility in organic semiconductors remains a challenge. Herein, two covalently dimerized pyrene derivatives (1Py‐2Py and 1Py‐1Py) with distinct chemical linkages and crystal packing arrangements are presented. Remarkably, the radiative transition of pyrene is gradually unforbidden from 1Py‐2Py to 1Py‐1Py. Moreover, 1Py‐2Py showcases 1D long‐range π─π stacking, while 1Py‐1Py exhibits 2D herringbone packing formed by a vast network of intermolecular C─H∙∙∙π interactions. To the surprise, both high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY = 72.17%) and high hole mobility (µ = 32.6 cm2 V−1 s−1) are simultaneously harvested in 1Py‐1Py crystal, which are far superior to those in 1Py‐2Py crystal (PLQY = 48.66% and µ = 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1). These findings underscore the potential of covalent pyrene dimer with 1‐position linkages as a promising organic semiconductor for the exceptional combination of strong luminescence and high mobility, which is substantially ascribed to the efficiently unforbidden emission and the favorable 2D charge transport pathways.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work gives an insight into solvent‐dependent rheology properties and phase separation dynamics for the R2R printing of flexible organic solar cells. With o‐XY solvent, the fully R2R gravure‐printed 1 and 28–104 cm2 large‐area modules give efficiencies of 14.67% and over 13%, respectively, with a high cell‐to‐module remaining ratio of 0.9 during upscaling.








Abstract
The cell‐to‐module (CTM) efficiency remaining ratio from monolithic device to large‐area module indicates the scalability potential for large‐area organic solar cells (OSCs). Nowadays, the CTM value is still low as the area increases to larger than 100 cm2. In this work, the crucial role of solvent in CTM for printing, which on one side influenced the large area homogeneity due to the ink rheology property, and on the other side impacted phase separation dynamics because of vaporization and crystalline rate is highlighted. The films from TMB show excessive pure phase and printing line defects in vertical the printing direction due to slow volatilization speed and low adhesion, while Tol‐based films present printing line defects along the printing direction due to large surface adhesion are demonstrated. In contrast, the films from non‐halogenated solvent, o‐XY exhibited a suitable phase separation size and excellent large‐area homogeneity. Consequently, the fully printed 1 cm2 FOSCs exhibit an efficiency of 14.81%. Moreover, the FOSCs module with an area of 28–104 cm2 gives an efficiency of over 13%, with a CTM of 0.9. Selecting suitable non‐halogenated solvents to achieve large‐area uniformity and appropriate phase separation morphology in >100 cm2 modules is of great importance for the industrialization of FOSCs.

This study, for the first time, highlights the translational SeNPs‐enhanced therapeutic efficacy against advanced NSCLC and elucidates the underlying mechanisms involving selenoprotein‐driven immune manipulation. The clinical Investigator‐initiated Trial shows that translational SeNPs supplementation in combination with bevacizumab/cisplatin/pemetrexed exhibits enhanced therapeutic efficacy with an objective response rate of 83.3% and a disease control rate of 100%, through potentiating selenoprotein‐driven antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Reconstructing the tumor immune microenvironment is an effective strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy limited by immunosuppression in non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, it is found that selenium (Se) depletion and immune dysfunction are present in patients with advanced NSCLC compared with healthy volunteers. Surprisingly, Se deficiency resulted in decreased immunity and accelerated rapid tumor growth in the mice model, which further reveals that the correlation between micronutrient Se and lung cancer progression. This pioneering work achieves 500‐L scale production of Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) at GMP level and utilizes it to reveal how and why the trace element Se can enhance clinical immune‐mediated treatment efficacy against NSCLC. The results found that translational SeNPs can promote the proliferation of NK cells and enhance its cytotoxicity against cancer cells by activating mTOR signaling pathway driven by GPXs to regulate the secretion of cytokines to achieve an antitumor response. Moreover, a clinical study of an Investigator‐initiated Trial shows that translational SeNPs supplementation in combination with bevacizumab/cisplatin/pemetrexed exhibits enhanced therapeutic efficacy with an objective response rate of 83.3% and a disease control rate of 100%, through potentiating selenoprotein‐driven antitumor immunity. Taken together, this study, for the first time, highlights the translational SeNPs‐enhanced therapeutic efficacy against clinical advanced NSCLC.

Inspired by some metalloenzymes, bismuth metal clusters are used as active sites and coupled with mesoporous channels to create a favorable catalytic microenvironment, enabling efficient electrocatalysis of the two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction in neutral media, with an industrially relevant current density and an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 21.4 mol gcatalyst−1 h−1 over 120 h.








Abstract
In nature, some metalloenzymes facilitate highly efficient catalytic transformations of small molecules, primarily attributed to the effective coupling between their metal cluster active sites and the surrounding microenvironment. Inspired by this, a thermotropic redispersion strategy to incorporate bismuth nanoclusters (Bi NCs) into mesoporous channels, mimicking metalloenzyme‐like catalysis to enhance the two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) for efficient neutral pH H2O2 electrosynthesis, is developed. This model electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional 2e− ORR performance with >95% H2O2 selectivity across 0.2–0.6 V vs RHE in neutral electrolyte. Notably, the system produces up to 7.2 wt% neutral H2O2 solution at an industrially relevant current density of ≈320 mA cm−2, with 90% Faradaic efficiency for H2O2 over 120 h in a flow cell, demonstrating significant practical potential. Mechanistic insights reveal that the introduction of Bi NCs enhances the adsorption of the *OOH intermediate, facilitating a highly active 2e− ORR process. Moreover, the mesoporous channels of the carbon support create a favorable catalytic microenvironment for O2 aeration and local alkalinity, further boosting H2O2 productivity. This catalyst design mimics metalloenzymes by optimal integration of the active site with the surrounding microenvironment, offering valuable insights for the rational design of nature‐inspired small‐molecule catalysts.

Various quaternary ammonium monomers with lengths of 6.2–8.4 Å are decorated on 1D porous channels of the TpBDOH framework to obtain biomimetic nanochannels for [UO2(CO3)3]4− ions. The unique structure enabled a selective capture of [UO2(CO3)3]4− ions from natural seawater, achieving a high uptake of 25.3 mg g−1 in 35 days.








Abstract
Biomimetic nanochannels enable fast and selective transport of mononuclear metal ions; however, their construction for complex ion transport remains in its infancy due to the nonuniform charge distribution and large geometric dimensions of coordination compounds. Herein, an ionic electrostatic interaction template strategy is proposed to prepare biomimetic channels for the capture of complex ions. Using the [UO2(CO3)3]4− ion as a template, various quaternary ammonium monomers with lengths of 6.2−8.4 Å are decorated on 1D porous channels of the TpBDOH framework via the Williamson ether reaction. Accordingly, the pore size is modulated in the sub‐nanometer range of 9−13 Å, facilitating multiple electrostatic attractions between quaternary ammonium fragments and the three equatorial carbonate ions on the [UO2(CO3)3]4− ion. The unique structure enabled highly efficient uranium adsorption with a capacity of 501.5 mg g−1 and a high selectivity coefficient for uranium over vanadium of >163.1. The resulting electropositive nanochannels selectively captured [UO2(CO3)3]4− ions from natural seawater, achieving a high uptake of 25.3 mg g−1 in 35 days.

Gallium‐based liquid metal alloys provide dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants, spontaneous metal enriching, and oxidation within their surface layers. Under alternating electromagnetic fields, these alloys can serve as the efficient self‐heater, mechanic disturber, and catalyst for thermolysis depolymerization of polycaprolactone with a rate ≈700 mg h−1 mL−1 and monomer selectivity ≈95.5%, offering an unprecedented “all‐in‐one” platform for continuous polyester depolymerization.








Abstract
Depolymerization and recycling of polyesters have shown great significance to economy, ecology, carbon neutrality and human health. Efficient catalysts for thermolysis depolymerization have long been pursued to achieve rapid depolymerization, high selectivity, and low energy consumption. In this study, it is found that liquid metal (LM) can serve as the efficient self‐heater, mechanic disturber and catalyst for thermolysis depolymerization of polyesters under alternating electromagnetic fields. When dissolving different metals (e.g., Sn, Zn, Al, and Mg) into gallium, LMs may provide dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants, spontaneous metal enriching, and oxidation within the LM surface layer. Without any conventional heaters and mechanic shakers, polycaprolactone is catalytically depolymerized into ɛ‐caprolactone at the rate of ≈700 mg h−1 mL−1 with the selectivity of 95.5%. The high surface tension and high mobility of LM also enable continuous depolymerization at an appropriate feeding speed of polyesters (including polyethylene terephthalate, polyhydroxybutyrate and polylactic acid). Thus, this study may offer an unprecedented “all‐in‐one” platform of liquid metal for continuous thermolysis depolymerization of polyesters, while without any requirement of external heater, mixer, and catalysts.

Inspired by DFT calculations, a novel 3D sulfur vacancy‐rich and heterostructured MnS/MXene aerogel is designed based on the synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures, and utilized as a cathode for ZIBs/ZICs for the first time, achieving significantly enhanced electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, systematic kinetic analyses, ex situ characterizations, and DFT calculations are utilized to reveal the phase transition mechanism.








Abstract
As a potential cathode material, manganese‐based sulfide has recently attracted increasing interest due to its many advantages in aqueous zinc‐ion storage. Unfortunately, some challenges such as sluggish kinetics, unstable structure, and controversial phase transition mechanism during the energy storage process hinder its practical application. Herein, inspired by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a novel 3D sulfur vacancy‐rich and heterostructured MnS/MXene aerogel is designed, and used as a cathode for aqueous Zn‐ion batteries/hybrid capacitors (ZIBs/ZICs) for the first time. Thanks to the synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures, the as‐constructed MnS/MXene//Zn ZIBs exhibit significantly enhanced electrochemical properties, especially outstanding rate capability and cyclic stability. More encouragingly, the as‐assembled MnS/MXene//porous carbon (PC) ZICs exhibit an ultrahigh energy density, a high power density, and a splendid cycling lifespan. Most notably, systematic kinetic analyses, ex situ characterizations, and DFT calculations illustrate that MnS/MXene first irreversibly converts into MnOx@ZnMnO3/MXene, and then undergoes a reversible conversion from MnOx@ZnMnO3/MXene to MnOOH@ZnMn2O4/MXene, accompanied by the co‐insertion/extraction of H+ and Zn2+. The synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures and the thorough mechanistic study proposed in this work offer valuable guidance for designing and exploiting high‐performance cathodes in aqueous zinc‐based energy storage devices.

Nature‐inspired, photolithography‐free, flexible, pixelated perovskite photosensitive films serve not only as a high‐resolution pixelation platform but also as a stress‐relief mechanism for otherwise brittle perovskite films, enabling enhanced mechanical flexibility. This synergetic approach yields pixelated perovskite layers with ≈1.5 µm pixel sizes, ≈100 nm gaps, and 2000 PPI resolution. Assembled photodetector arrays offer detectivity greater than 1013 Jones with cross‐talk‐free imaging. The flexible polymer grid also enhances mechanical durability, expanding potential applications in robotics, biomedical imaging, and virtual/augmented reality.








Abstract
A nature‐inspired fabrication method based on a photolithography‐free flexible polymer grid is reported for high‐resolution pixelation of perovskite photodiode arrays with exceptional mechanical ductility and a morphology resembling that of natural compound eyes. The resulting pixelated perovskite photosensitive layer has a ≈1 µm pixel size with 2000 Pixels per inch (PPI) resolution when fully assembled as a photodetector array, delivering a detectivity of >1013 Jones while providing cross‐talk free imaging. Using a polymer grid effectively releases stress on the perovskite platform, greatly increasing the mechanical agility of the otherwise brittle perovskite film. This novel fabrication methodology and device design offer new possibilities for applications in robotics, biomedical imaging, and virtual and augmented reality.

A dual oxidation suppression strategy is developed to suppress the Sn2+ oxidation in 2D tin perovskites, i.e. adopting an oxygen‐free two‐step growth to enhance the crystal quality and incorporating electron‐donating biuret molecules to coordinate with Sn2+. As a result, nanolasers based on these tin perovskite flakes exhibited an ultralow lasing threshold of <1 µJ cm−2 and superior lasing stability.








Abstract
Low lasing threshold and long‐term operational stability are essential in advancing cost‐effective, efficient lead‐free (tin) halide perovskite lasers. However, the rapid crystallization of tin perovskites and oxidation of Sn2+ lead to substantial amounts of lattice defects, detrimental to laser performance enhancement. Herein, a dual oxidation suppression strategy is developed to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ 2D tin halide perovskites, i.e., adopting an oxygen‐free two‐step growth to enhance the crystal quality and incorporating electron‐donating biuret molecules to coordinate with Sn2+ during the crystal growth, which led to the substantial reduction of lasing threshold to <1 µJ cm−2 in (PEA)2MASn2I7. This represents the lowest value in lead‐free perovskite nanolasers and approximately one order of magnitude lower than those previously reported for tin‐based nanolasers. Investigations into the spontaneous photoluminescence (PL) and stimulated lasing emission revealed that 2D tin perovskites exhibited superior photostability and lasing stability compared to their lead counterparts. Specifically, the lasing intensity of (PEA)2MA2Sn3I10 constantly increased by >300% under optical pumping and the lasing threshold decreased by ≈17%, which is not observed in their lead counterparts. The findings highlight the prospect of 2D tin halide perovskites as lead‐free gain materials and cavities for solution‐processed nanolasers with low lasing thresholds and exceptional stability.

The introduction of a high‐entropy strategy into CaBi2Nb2O9 achieves significant breakthroughs in piezoelectric and ferroelectric performance by designing local polarization configuration and defect structure, which causes the formation of high‐density 2D amorphous defect, contributing to extra out‐of‐plane polarization components. This work provides a widely applicable paradigm for designing more novel high‐performance bismuth layer‐structured ferroelectrics.








Abstract
High‐temperature piezoelectric materials are essential components of transducers and accelerometers applied in the fields of aircraft engines, automobiles, nuclear power units, etc., yet how to achieve large piezoelectricity accompanied by high Curie temperature and superior resistivity is still a big challenge. Here, the high‐entropy strategy is utilized to design bismuth‐layer high‐temperature piezoelectric ceramics, resulting in an excellent comprehensive piezoelectric performance with a record‐high figure of merit (d33*TC) and a high electrical DC resistivity of 1.0 × 106 Ω cm at 750 °C. High‐energy synchrotron X‐ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy results suggest that there is no significant change in long‐range average orthorhombic structure through high‐entropy engineering, providing a structural basis for retaining a high TC. Encouragingly, highly dense bismuth‐layer vacancies occupied by alien atoms trigger extra unique out‐of‐plane polarization in perovskite layers around these 2D amorphous defects, as confirmed by quantitative analysis of local polarization configurations and density functional theory calculations. Together with the decreased polarization reversal energy barrier, the high entropy strategy benefits polarization flexibility under external stimulation and offers breakthroughs in electrical properties. This work provides new insight into the improvement of comprehensive functional properties through the cocktail effect and structure mechanism for designing novel high‐entropy materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) of unconventional composition and defined structures are investigated as small oligonucleotide carriers. A composition is identified that outperforms Onpattro in cargo delivery to HeLa cells. The structure of these LNPs resembles a micellar cubic phase not commonly associated with high‐performing LNPs. The results shed light on the LNP structure‐function relationship and highlight the complexity of these platforms.








Abstract
Despite increasing knowledge about the mechanistic aspects of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as oligonucleotide carriers, the structure‐function relationship in LNPs has been generally overlooked. Understanding this correlation is critical in the rational design of LNPs. Here, a materials characterization approach is utilized, applying structural information from small‐angle X‐ray scattering experiments to design novel LNPs focusing on distinct lipid organizations with a minimal compositional variation. The lipid phase structures are characterized in these LNPs and their corresponding bulk lipid mixtures with small‐angle scattering techniques, and the LNP‐cell interactions in vitro with respect to cytotoxicity, hemolysis, cargo delivery, cell uptake, and lysosomal swelling. An LNP is identified that outperforms Onpattro lipid composition using lipid components and molar ratios which differ from the gold standard clinical LNPs. The base structure of these LNPs has an inverse micellar phase organization, whereas the LNPs with inverted hexagonal phases are not functional, suggesting that this phase formation may not be needed for LNP‐mediated oligonucleotide delivery. The importance of stabilizer choice for the LNP function is demonstrated and super‐resolution microscopy highlights the complexity of the delivery mechanisms, where lysosomal swelling for the majority of LNPs is observed. This study highlights the importance of advanced characterization for the rational design of LNPs to enable the study of structure‐function relationships.

Asymmetric small molecule acceptor with a methoxylated end group is produced here, whose oxygen vibration is found effective in suppressing triplet state formation, thereby minimizing non‐radiative energy loss for 20% efficiency in nonhalogenated solvent cast binary organic solar cells.









Abstract
Boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been restricted by its undesirably high energy loss, especially for those nonhalogenated solvent‐processed ones. Here,a dichloro‐methoxylated terminal group in an asymmetric small molecular acceptor design, which realizes a significantly reduced non‐radiative energy loss (0.179 eV) compared to its symmetric counterpart (0.202 eV), is reported. Consequently, the device efficiency is improved by up to 20% for PM6:BTP‐eC9‐4ClO, without sacrificing the photon harvest or charge transport ability of the control system PM6:BTP‐eC9. Further characterizations reveal the asymmetric acceptor BTP‐eC9‐4ClO's blend film demonstrates a suppressed triplet state formation, enabled by an enhanced electron delocalization. In addition, the asymmetric BTP‐eC9‐4ClO is found to be thermally stabler than BTP‐eC9, and thus providing an improved device stability, whose T80 value reaches > 7800 h under 80 °C anneal in N2 via linear extrapolation. This work represents state‐of‐the‐art device performance for nonhalogenated solvent‐processed binary OSCs with certified results (19.45%).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A purely electric‐modulated ferroelectric tunnel junction synapse capable of multimodal recognition and spatiotemporal learning has been successfully designed. Its unique functionality is achieved by integrating volatile oxygen vacancy migration and the nonvolatile polarization switching mechanisms within a single device, providing bidirectional relaxation and adaptive long‐term plasticity characteristics, which are essential for multimodal recognition and spatiotemporal learning, respectively.








Abstract
The brain's unique processing power, such as perception, understanding, and interaction with the multimodal world, is achieved through diverse synaptic functionalities, which include varied temporal responses and adaptation. Although specific functions in brain‐like computing have been successfully realized, emulating multimodal recognition and spatio‐temporal learning remain significant challenges due to the difficulties in achieving multimodal signal processing and adaptive long‐term plasticity in a single electronic synapse. Here, a purely electrically‐modulated ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) memristive synapse which realizes multimodal recognition and spatio‐temporal pattern identification, through the integration of oxygen vacancies migration and ferroelectric polarization switching mechanisms, providing bi‐directional relaxation and adaptive long‐term plasticity simultaneously in the isolated device. The bi‐directional relaxation enables multimodal recognition in the purely electrically‐modulated FTJ device by encoding distinct sensory signals with different electrical polarities. The multimodal perception task is implemented with a multimodal computing system combining visual and speech pattern recognition. Moreover, the adaptive long‐term plasticity allows spatio‐temporal pattern recognition, which is demonstrated by identifying object orientation and direction of motion with a neural network incorporating the arrayed synapses. This work provides a feasible approach for designing bio‐realistic electronic synapses and achieving highly intelligent neuromorphic computing.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Employing a two‐step synthesis approach, a library of high‐entropy metal sulfide (HEMS) materials spanning quinary to duodenary compositions are built by arbitrarily combining 5–12 elements from 28 candidates in the periodic table. The septenary HEMS particles exhibit remarkable cycling stability—retaining≈230 mAh g−1 over 3000 cycles—attributed to uniform metal mixing during discharge.








Abstract
Controlled synthesis of high‐entropy materials offers a unique platform to explore unprecedented electrochemical properties. High‐entropy metal sulfides (HEMSs) have recently emerged as promising electrodes in electrochemical energy storage applications. However, synthesizing HEMSs with a tunable number of components and composition is still challenging. Here, a HEMS library is built by using a general synthetic approach, enabling the synthesis of HEMS with arbitrary combinations of 5 to 12 out of 28 elements in the periodic table. The formation of a solid solution of HEMS is attributed to the two‐step method that lowers the energy barrier and facilitates the sulfur diffusion during the synthesis. The hard soft acid base (HSAB) theory is used to precisely describe the conversion rates of the metal precursors during the synthesis. The HEMSs as cathodes in Na‐ion batteries (SIBs) is investigated, where 7‐component HEMS (7‐HEMS) delivers a promising rate capability and an exceptional sodium storage performance with reversible a capacity of 230 mAh g−1 over 3000 cycles. This work paves the way for the multidisciplinary exploration of HEMSs and their potential in electrochemical energy storage.

A robust in situ cross‐linked polymer electrolyte and its derived Mg3N2‐rich bilayer interphase are obtained by a multifunctional diamine additive. The assembled Mo6S8//Mg cells demonstrate stable cycling over 200 cycles at 150 °C with 80% capacity retention.








Abstract
The electrolyte and its interfacial chemistry are crucial for the development of high‐temperature magnesium metal batteries. Here, a robust in situ cross‐linked gel polymer electrolyte (MgB@CGPE) and its derived Mg3N2‐rich (Mg3N2 and related Mg─N─H complexes) interphase are obtained by a multifunctional diamine additive. The Mg3N2‐rich interphase exhibits low magnesium ion migration activation energy and can effectively inhibit the continuous decomposition of electrolyte at the interface under elevated temperatures. Moreover, the MgB@CGPE can enable reversible magnesium deposition and dissolution over a wide temperature range of 30–180 °C. The assembled Mo6S8//MgB@CGPE//Mg cells demonstrate stable cycling over 200 cycles at 150 °C with 80% capacity retention. Additionally, these cells also address crucial mechanical and thermal safety concerns, indicating their potential for use under extreme conditions. This work presents a universal and practical strategy for designing polymer electrolytes that operate at elevated temperatures.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through delicate design of host‐guest active layer, the hydrogen bonding interactions between host donor D18 and guest BTO‐BO facilitate the formation of predominant J‐type stacking of D18 during crystallization, significantly reducing visible absorption and enhancing hole transport. The resultant ST‐OSCs with optical modulation achieved record light utilization efficiencies of 6.02%, while also demonstrating excellent flexibility and scalability.








Abstract
The trade‐off between average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), governed by the molecular stacking of the donor and acceptor materials in semitransparent organic solar cells (ST‐OSCs), significantly constrains improvements in light utilization efficiency (LUE). Here, simultaneous enhancement of AVT and PCE is achieved by meticulously designing host‐guest active layers to fine‐tune the molecular stacking. A systematic investigation of various host donor and guest material combinations reveals that the donor material (D18) with more electron‐deficient hydrogen atoms tends to form C─H···O interactions with the guest material (BTO‐BO) that features electron‐rich oxygen atoms. Hydrogen bonding interactions between host donor D18 and guest BTO‐BO facilitate the transition from mixed J‐type and H‐type molecular stacking modes of the donor to predominant J‐type stacking during crystallization, significantly reducing visible absorption and enhancing hole transport. Additionally, BTO‐BO can act as a nucleation agent for the host acceptor BTP‐eC9 to increase the crystallinity and absorption coefficient of the active layer, thereby, enhancing near‐infrared light absorption. The resultant toluene‐processed ST‐OSCs with optical modulation exhibit simultaneous improvement in PCE and AVT, delivering record LUEs of 6.02%. Notably, this host‐guest active layer demonstrates exceptional compatibility with flexible devices and promising scalability for greenhouse photovoltaic applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The study designs a bifunctional core/shell‐structured carbon support with the core of highly graphitized carbon and the shell of heteroatom‐doped amorphous carbon, precise control of Pt nanoparticles semi‐embedded by the amorphous shell contributes to the realization of simultaneously exceeded durability targets of electrocatalysts and carbon support for PEMFCs.








Abstract
To enhance the lifetime of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, developing highly durable platinum‐based cathode catalysts is essential. While two degradation pathways for the cathode catalyst—carbon corrosion and electrocatalyst (platinum nanoparticles) coarsening—have been identified, current approaches to enhance its durability are limited to addressing individual degradation pathways. Herein, the study develops a core/shell‐structured carbon support that is designed to afford cathode catalysts capable of simultaneously inhibiting carbon corrosion and electrocatalyst coarsening. The core/shell structure is distinguished by its bifunctional nature: the core is made of highly graphitized carbon tailored to build a robust carbon skeleton, and the shell comprises heteroatom‐doped amorphous carbon engineered to prevent electrocatalyst coarsening by chemical/physical anchoring of platinum nanoparticles. Thanks to this elaborate design, the catalyst surpasses the durability targets for carbon supports and electrocatalysts set by the U.S. Department of Energy, as supported by the achieved durability metrics after the square‐wave/triangle‐wave accelerated stress tests: electrochemical surface area loss at 13%/3%, mass activity loss at 27%/17%, and voltage loss of 29 mV (at 0.8 A cm−2)/4 mV (at 1.5 A cm−2).

This work presents the design and functionality of a gradient‐metasurface‐contact CPL photodetector that operates at zero bias, offering a high discrimination ratio (≈1.6 ✗ 104), broadband response (500–1100 nm), and immunity to non‐CPL fields. By integrating InSe flakes with CPL‐selective metasurface contacts, it achieves CPL‐dependent vectorial photocurrents. Additionally, its application in multivalued logic and CPL‐encrypted communication showcases its potential in advanced on‐chip polarization detection systems.








Abstract
Spin light detection is a rapidly advancing field with significant impact on diverse applications in biology, medicine, and photonics. Developing integrated circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors is pivotal for next‐generation compact polarimeters. However, previous compact CPL detectors, based on natural materials or artificial resonant nanostructures, exhibit intrinsically weak CPL polarization sensitivity, are susceptible to other polarization states, and suffer from limited bandwidths. A gradient‐metasurface‐contact CPL photodetector is demonstrated operating at zero‐bias with a high discrimination ratio (≈1.6 ✗ 104), broadband response (500–1100 nm), and immunity to non‐CPL field components. The photodetector integrates InSe flakes with CPL‐selective metasurface contacts, forming an asymmetric junction interface driven by CPL‐dependent unidirectional propagating surface plasmon waves, generating zero‐bias vectorial photocurrents. Furthermore, it is implemented the developed CPL photodetector in a multivalued logic system and demonstrated the optical decoding of CPL‐encrypted communication signals. This metasurface contact engineering represents a new paradigm in light property detection, paving the way for future integrated optoelectronic systems for on‐chip polarization detection.

<title>Rejuvenation of Tumor‐Specific T Cells via Ultrahigh DAR Antibody‐Polymeric Imidazoquinoline Complexes: Coordinated Targeting of PDL1 and Efficient TLR7/8 Activation in Intratumoral Dendritic Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents an ultrahigh drug‐to‐antibody ratio (DAR) antibody‐polymeric imidazoquinoline complex (αPDL1‐PLG‐IMDQ) that activates intratumoral immature dendritic cells (imDCs) and enhances T‐cell responses. By preferentially targeting PDL1‐high DCs, it efficiently delivers the TLR7/8 agonist IMDQ, overcoming systemic inflammation and imDC‐mediated immunosuppression, leading to significant tumor growth and metastasis inhibition, with potential for advancing tumor‐targeted immunotherapy.









Abstract
Intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal in tumor treatment due to their immature and pro‐tumoral state induced by the tumor microenvironment. Clinically, these immature DCs correlate with disease progression and recurrence, adversely affecting prognosis. Activation of DCs by the TLR7/8 agonist imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) has yielded promising results, but they are limited by systemic inflammation risks, and high programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression on DCs impedes CD8+ T cell activity. Thus, the study introduces an antibody‐polymeric IMDQ complex (αPDL1‐PLG‐IMDQ) with an ultrahigh drug‐to‐antibody ratio, where αPDL1 is conjugated to Fc‐binding peptides on polymeric IMDQ. This complex targets high PDL1‐expressing intratumoral DCs with high probability, inducing PDL1‐mediated endocytosis to deliver IMDQ to TLR7/8 within endosomes, effectively activating DCs (CD11c+MHC II+: 2.33% versus 1.09%, CD11c+CD86+: 2.49% versus 1.00% on tumors compared to phosphate‐buffered saline treatment) and priming T cells. It also blocks PDL1/PD1 interactions, enhancing tumor‐specific T‐cell activation and memory. Notably, αPDL1‐PLG‐IMDQ achieved a 97% tumor inhibition rate, prevented tumor regrowth in rechallenge experiments, and reduced lung metastases of tumors by 83%. These findings underscore its potential for intratumoral DC‐targeted immunotherapy and novel systemic IMDQ and checkpoint inhibitor combinations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Atomically dispersed Co/Mo sites anchored on mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (Co/Mo‐MCHS) are designed via template‐engaged strategy for two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction. Owing to the mesoporous hollow merits and electron‐donating effect from Mo species, the Co/Mo‐MCHS electrocatalyst displays efficient two‐electron pathway with high hydrogen peroxide selectivity, and stable operation in acid.








Abstract
Two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) in acidic media is a promising route for the decentralized and on‐site hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. Nevertheless, strong interaction between active sites and *OOH intermediates usually induces the O─O bond cleavage to convert 2e− pathway into the sluggish 4e− ORR. Therefore, it is highly necessary to optimize the electronic structure of 2e− ORR electrocatalysts for the regulation of adsorption energy. Herein, we propose the utilization of atomically dispersed Co/Mo sites anchored on mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (Co/Mo‐MCHS) via a template‐engaged strategy for highly selective ORR to H2O2 in acid. Benefitting from the electron‐donating effect of Mo atoms, an enriched electron density around the Co center for Co/Mo‐MCHS is observed, resulting in optimal adsorption of the key *OOH intermediates to approach the apex of 2e− ORR volcano plot. Moreover, the introduction of Mo species simultaneously suppresses the electroreduction of as‐obtained H2O2 on Co sites. As a consequence, Co/Mo‐MCHS delivers a high H2O2 selectivity of 90–95% in acid. The flow cell based on the Co/Mo‐MCHS catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 2102 mg for 150 h. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to other early transition metal elements with similar electronic modifier effects.

Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human‐machine interactions. Researchers designed a lithium bond‐mediated molecular cascade hydrogel for bioelectronic interfaces, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.








Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human‐machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non‐damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond‐mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197 J m−2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25 kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14 S m−1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

In this work, the C/CoxTy nanoplates with high‐efficiency and tunable electromagnetic properties are successfully prepared by customizing Co‐based nanoparticles. Relying on these C/CoxTy nanoplates, a series of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices are developed, opening up a new era of multispectral electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Electromagnetic materials with adjustable dielectric and magnetic properties are constantly sought after in electronic and industrial fields. In this study, an innovative strategy that customizes anchored Co‐based nanoparticles to optimize the electronic behaviors is proposed for the first time, enabling a controllable and high‐efficiency evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic response of Co‐based (C/CoxTy) nanoplates across the X‐ray, light in the solar band and gigahertz band. Specifically, in the gigahertz band, the C/Co and C/Co3Se4 nanoplates with high‐power loss capabilities can effectively attenuate and convert electromagnetic energy into heat energy, which not only prevents space electromagnetic radiation but also powers energy for various electromagnetic devices such as thermoelectric generators and microwave actuators. Moreover, multiband antennas and ultra‐wideband bandstop filters are successfully achieved and flexibly tuned. Meanwhile, C/CoxTy nanoplates photo‐ and X‐ray detectors are constructed successfully. Additionally, the C/CoTe nanoplate X‐ray detector, featuring remarkable stability, sensitivity and penetrability, is successfully utilized to construct the interaction system integrating communication and imaging. In summary, this work offers an effective way for flexible regulation of multispectral electromagnetic response, significantly advancing the development of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic‐level controllable growth of composition‐engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom‐assisted incorporation‐enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high‐efficiency and long‐lifetime ultraviolet light‐emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329 nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN‐based ultraviolet (UV) light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280–330 nm wavelength range, known as the “UVB gap”. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga‐adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga‐adatoms during the growth of low‐Al‐composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high‐Al‐composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high‐quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high‐efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The research develops an encapsulation‐free, patterned flexible fuel cell patch (PFCP) with the capability to generate electrostimulation with precisely controlled pattern distributions by adjusting electrode configurations. The inherent adhesion and flexibility properties of the PFCP underpin its performance in vivo. The research introduces a novel and promising tool for accelerating tissue repair via the application of patterned electrostimulation.








Abstract
The distribution of electrical potentials and current in exogenous electrostimulation has significant impacts on its effectiveness in promoting tissue repair. However, there is still a lack of a flexible, implantable power source capable of generating customizable patterned electric fields for in situ electrostimulation(electrical stimulation). Herein, this study reports a fuel cell patch (FCP) that can provide in situ electrostimulation and a hypoxic microenvironment to promote tissue repair synergistically. Stable and highly efficient PtNi nanochains and PtNi nanocages electrocatalysts with anti‐interference properties catalyze glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction respectively in an encapsulation‐free fuel cell. The laser‐induced graphene (LIG) electrode loaded with PtNi electrocatalysts is transferred to the surface of a flexible chitosan hydrogel. The resulting flexible FCP can adapt to tissues with different morphologies, firmly adhere to prevent suturing, and provide potent electrostimulation (0.403 V, 51.55 µW cm−2). Additionally, it consumes oxygen in situ to create a hypoxic microenvironment, increasing the expression of hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α (HIF‐1α). Based on the different pattern requirements of exogenous electrostimulation during the repair of various types of tissue, an axial FCP for peripheral nerves and a flower‐patterned FCP for myocardial tissue are constructed and transplanted into animals, showing significant tissue repair in both models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Rechargeable aqueous batteries with metal anodes promise enhanced energy density, combining higher output voltage and capacity with high safety. This perspective highlights the emerging potential of the Sn metal anode, emphasizing its resistance to hydrogen evolution, high reversibility, and sustainability. Key challenges, including dead Sn formation and electrolyte evolution, as well as innovative design strategies for robust Sn‐based batteries are also discussed. The development of Sn metal batteries could contribute to a sustainable society.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries based on metallic anodes hold tremendous potential of high energy density enabled by the combination of relatively low working potential and large capacity while retaining the intrinsic safety nature and economical value of aqueous systems; However, the realization of these promised advantages relies on the identification of an ideal metal anode chemistry with all these merits. In this review, the emerging Sn metal anode chemistry is examined as such an anode candidate in both acidic and alkaline media, where the inertness of Sn toward hydrogen evolution, flat low voltage profile, and low polarization make it a unique metal anode for aqueous batteries. From a panoramic viewpoint, the key challenges and detrimental issues of Sn metal batteries are discussed, including dead Sn formation, self‐discharge, and electrolyte degradation, as well as strategies for mitigating these issues by constructing robust Sn anodes. New design approaches for more durable and reliable Sn metal batteries are also discussed, with the aim of fully realizing the potential of Sn anode chemistry.

<title>Tuning Transition Metal 3d Spin state on Single‐atom Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The introduction of P into a single‐atom Fe catalyst is shown to induce a shift in its electronic configuration toward a high spin state. This is proposed to enhance electron back donation via the dxz/dyz‐π* bond, which improves *COOH adsorption and facilitates the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO.








Abstract
Tuning transition metal spin states potentially offers a powerful means to control electrocatalyst activity. However, implementing such a strategy in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) is challenging since rational design rules have yet to be elucidated. Here we show how the addition of P dopants to a ferromagnetic element (Fe, Co, and Ni) single‐atom catalyst (SAC) can shift its spin state. For instance, with Fe SAC, P dopants enable a switch from low spin state (dx2‐ y20, dz20, dxz2, dyz1, dxy2) in Fe‐N4 to high spin state (dx2‐y20, dxz1, dyz1, dz21, dxy2) in Fe‐N3‐P. This is studied using a suite of characterization efforts, including X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. When used for CO2R, the SAC with Fe‐N3‐P active sites yields > 90% Faradaic efficiency to CO over a wide potential window of ≈530 mV and a maximum CO partial current density of ≈600 mA cm−2. Density functional theory calculations reveal that high spin state Fe3+ exhibits enhanced electron back donation via the dxz/dyz‐π* bond, which enhances *COOH adsorption and promotes CO formation. Taken together, the results show how the SAC spin state can be intentionally tuned to boost CO2R performance.

This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e⁻ ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e− ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e− ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e– ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e− ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e− ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e− ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e− ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state‐of‐the‐art catalysts of 2e− ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e− ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H2O2 electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Magneto‐ferroelectric effects in van der Waals EuO/graphene heterostructures emerge via a topotactic method, inducing high compressive strain. This strain stabilizes a ferroelectric state up to room temperature, coexisting with the magnetic proximity effect in graphene. These intertwined magneto‐electric effects enable control of magnetization and polarization, offering the potential for next‐gen memory and neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
2D van der Waals materials and their heterostructures are a fantastic playground to explore emergent phenomena arising from electronic quantum hybridization effects. In the last decade, the spin‐dependant hybridization effect pushed this frontier further introducing the magnetic proximity effect as a promising tool for spintronic applications. Here the uncharted proximity‐controlled magnetoelectric effect in EuO/graphene heterostructure is unveiled. This is obtained while creating a new multiferroic hybrid heterostructure with multifunctional properties. Using a topotactic method magnetic insulating EuO thin films on graphene is grown under high compressive strain, which induces the appearance of an additional ferroelectric order, with an electric polarization that reaches up to 18 µC cm−2 at room temperature. This observation therefore quantitatively confirms the theoretical predictions made 15 years ago of a strain‐induced ferroelectric state in EuO. Moreover, the EuO induces a magnetic proximity state into the graphene layer by interfacial hybridization. This new ferroelectric state in the EuO/graphene heterostructure is stable up to room temperature where it coexists with the EuO/graphene magnetic state. Furthermore, intertwined magneto‐electric effects are shown in these strained heterostructures which can facilitate the manipulation of magnetization and electric polarization in future memory and neuromorphic devices.

Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human‐machine interactions. Researchers designed a lithium bond‐mediated molecular cascade hydrogel for bioelectronic interfaces, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.








Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human‐machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non‐damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond‐mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197 J m−2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25 kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14 S m−1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic‐level controllable growth of composition‐engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom‐assisted incorporation‐enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high‐efficiency and long‐lifetime ultraviolet light‐emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329 nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN‐based ultraviolet (UV) light‐emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280–330 nm wavelength range, known as the “UVB gap”. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga‐adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga‐adatoms during the growth of low‐Al‐composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high‐Al‐composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high‐quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high‐efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

The introduction of P into a single‐atom Fe catalyst is shown to induce a shift in its electronic configuration toward a high spin state. This is proposed to enhance electron back donation via the dxz/dyz‐π* bond, which improves *COOH adsorption and facilitates the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO.








Abstract
Tuning transition metal spin states potentially offers a powerful means to control electrocatalyst activity. However, implementing such a strategy in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) is challenging since rational design rules have yet to be elucidated. Here we show how the addition of P dopants to a ferromagnetic element (Fe, Co, and Ni) single‐atom catalyst (SAC) can shift its spin state. For instance, with Fe SAC, P dopants enable a switch from low spin state (dx2‐ y20, dz20, dxz2, dyz1, dxy2) in Fe‐N4 to high spin state (dx2‐y20, dxz1, dyz1, dz21, dxy2) in Fe‐N3‐P. This is studied using a suite of characterization efforts, including X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. When used for CO2R, the SAC with Fe‐N3‐P active sites yields > 90% Faradaic efficiency to CO over a wide potential window of ≈530 mV and a maximum CO partial current density of ≈600 mA cm−2. Density functional theory calculations reveal that high spin state Fe3+ exhibits enhanced electron back donation via the dxz/dyz‐π* bond, which enhances *COOH adsorption and promotes CO formation. Taken together, the results show how the SAC spin state can be intentionally tuned to boost CO2R performance.

The catalytic performance of a 2e− ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e− ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e− ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state‐of‐the‐art catalysts of 2e− ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e− ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H2O2 electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.

Magneto‐ferroelectric effects in van der Waals EuO/graphene heterostructures emerge via a topotactic method, inducing high compressive strain. This strain stabilizes a ferroelectric state up to room temperature, coexisting with the magnetic proximity effect in graphene. These intertwined magneto‐electric effects enable control of magnetization and polarization, offering the potential for next‐gen memory and neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
2D van der Waals materials and their heterostructures are a fantastic playground to explore emergent phenomena arising from electronic quantum hybridization effects. In the last decade, the spin‐dependant hybridization effect pushed this frontier further introducing the magnetic proximity effect as a promising tool for spintronic applications. Here the uncharted proximity‐controlled magnetoelectric effect in EuO/graphene heterostructure is unveiled. This is obtained while creating a new multiferroic hybrid heterostructure with multifunctional properties. Using a topotactic method magnetic insulating EuO thin films on graphene is grown under high compressive strain, which induces the appearance of an additional ferroelectric order, with an electric polarization that reaches up to 18 µC cm−2 at room temperature. This observation therefore quantitatively confirms the theoretical predictions made 15 years ago of a strain‐induced ferroelectric state in EuO. Moreover, the EuO induces a magnetic proximity state into the graphene layer by interfacial hybridization. This new ferroelectric state in the EuO/graphene heterostructure is stable up to room temperature where it coexists with the EuO/graphene magnetic state. Furthermore, intertwined magneto‐electric effects are shown in these strained heterostructures which can facilitate the manipulation of magnetization and electric polarization in future memory and neuromorphic devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anisotropic conducting polymer films can exhibit optical hyperbolic properties which here are found connected to large birefringence and linear dichroism. Off‐axis twist‐stacking of only two such subwavelength films can therefore enable large and broadband circular dichroism (CD), with CD bandwidth closely related to the hyperbolic bandwidth. The study demonstrates the general concept using twist‐stacked stretched PEDOT films.








Abstract
Chiral‐specific interaction of light with organic materials is important but typically arises from circular polarization‐dependent absorption of specific optical transitions, resulting in narrow effective wavelength ranges. This study presents a scalable and universal concept for broadband circular dichroism (CD) enabled by strained conducting polymer thin films that possess in‐plane hyperbolic optical behavior (i.e., optically metallic and dielectric properties along orthogonal directions). It is shown that off‐axis stacking of two or more such thin films provides broadband CD that varies with the hyperbolic bandwidth and stacking geometry. By contrast to traditional chiroptical materials, the CD can also be modulated by redox‐tuning of the hyperbolic polymer properties, opening for broadband dynamic chiroptical components.

<title>Molecular Chain Interpenetration–Enabled High Interfacial Compatibility of Ionic and Electronic Conductors for Stretchable Ionic Devices</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high interfacial compatibility of ionic and electronic conductors is achieved via molecular chain interpenetration. With the benefit of the interface, the fabricated reversible adhesive electrode exhibits a high shear strength of 317 kPa at a low voltage of 4 V, and the ionic diode and transistor maintain stable semiconductor characteristics under arbitrary deformation.








Abstract
Ionic devices find applications such as flexible electronics and biomedicines and function by exploiting hybrid circuits of mobile ions and electrons. However, the poor interfacial compatibility of hard electronic conductors with soft ionic conductors in ionic devices leads to low deformability, sensitivity, electromechanical responses, and stability. Herein, an interpenetrating interface between silicone‐modified polyurethane/carbon nanotube electronic conductors and ionoelastomers in an ionic device using in situ polymerization is fabricated. A robust interpenetrating electronic/ionic conductor interface is realized through molecular chain entanglement and molecular forces (such as ion‐dipole interactions and H‐bonds), effectively enhancing the bonding strength and contact area between the components and resulting in an excellent flexibility, stability, and device performance. The electroadhesive prepared based on this strategy exhibits a superrobust shear strength of 317 kPa under a reduced voltage input of −4 V, and the diode and the transistor can undergo arbitrary deformation while maintaining the semiconductor device characteristics, including rectification and switching. In addition, electromechanical transducers exhibit sensitive electrical responses to various deformation signals. This solution to the interfacial compatibility problems of electronic and ionic conductors holds promise for the development of multifunctional ionic devices.

<title>Compression‐Durable Soft Electronic Circuits Enabled by Embedding Self‐Healing Biphasic Liquid‐Solid Metal Into Microstructured Elastomeric Channels</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A compressible, stretchable conductor combining liquid (GalnSn) and solid (BilnSn) metals is designed. The solid layer resists compression, while the liquid layer self‐heals cracks under strain. Embedded micropillars enhance durability, enabling stable conductivity under extreme pressure (38.2 MPa) and cyclic loads. This biphasic design allows high‐resolution manufacturing of robust antennas and circuits for soft electronics.








Abstract
Compression strongly degrades the electrical conductivity of the liquid‐metal‐based circuits because the liquid state is prone to be squashed. Here, a new compressible and stretchable biphasic liquid‐solid self‐healing circuit is proposed by filling GalnSn‐BilnSn biphasic metal into micropillar‐embedded channels. The underlying BilnSn solid alloy layer serves as a compression resistance layer, while the upper GalnSn liquid metal layer enables the real‐time filling of the cracks in the solid layer under large deformations, resulting in autonomous self‐healing and maintenance of conductivity under both stretching and compression. The embedded micropillars further improved the compression durability by providing additional mechanical support. The synergistic effect between the biphasic materials and embedded micropillar enables the designed stretchable conductor to show stable performance (R/R0<10) under pressure of 38.2 MPa (≈389.5 Kgf cm−2) and cyclic pressure of 15.8 MPa over 7000 cycles (R/R0<0.48%) without compromising the stretchability, whereas the liquid metal‐based conductor can only endure pressure up to 2.5 MPa (25.49 Kgf cm−2). The stretchable antenna and hybrid circuits fabricated using the designed biphasic metal conductor showed enhanced compression durability. The structure‐confined filling strategy enabled high‐resolution and scalable manufacturing. Overall, robust stability under compression significantly expands the range of possible applications of liquid‐metal‐based conductors in soft electronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ion‐confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio‐inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio‐inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high‐performance machine vision. Herein, an ion‐confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio‐inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine‐tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio‐inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.

<title>Shape‐Controlled Reversible Li Plating‐Stripping for Stable and High‐Rate Anode‐Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A shape change‐free and lithium‐free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface‐protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life‐span anode‐free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode‐free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high‐energy‐density power sources with low‐cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change‐free and lithium‐free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating‐stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly‐ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface‐coated lithium‐phosphorus‐oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid‐electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long‐term and high‐rate cycling. The assembled half‐cell stably works at 1.2 mA cm−2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre‐deposition, full‐cells using modified‐LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150‐cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617 Wh kg−1 at 2C rate.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work demonstrates an on‐chip non‐volatile reconfigurable THz topological silicon chip that integrates a waveguide‐cavity coupled system with phase‐change material, Ge2Sb2Te5, enabling persistent and efficient functionality without constant power input. This advancement significantly paves the way for integrating phase change materials into silicon topological chips for programmable photonic devices, including interconnects, modulators, phase shifters, and logic circuits.








Abstract
Programmable on‐chip terahertz (THz) topological photonic devices are poised to address the rising need for high‐capacity data systems, offering broad bandwidth, minimal loss, and reconfigurability. However, current THz topological chips rely on volatile tuning mechanisms that require continuous power to function. Here, a nonvolatile, programmable THz topological silicon chip is demonstrated that integrates a waveguide‐cavity coupled system with phase‐change material, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), enabling persistent and efficient functionality without constant power input. Through precise tuning of the intermediate phase states of GST between amorphous and crystalline forms, a stable, non‐volatile reconfiguration of the topological cavity is achieved, enabling transitions across over‐coupling, critical coupling, and under‐coupling states. Multi‐level modulation of resonance transmission with a modulation depth of 70 dB is demonstrated, enabling precise control over the onset and disappearance of resonance modes and dynamic tuning of critical coupling states. The THz topological chip facilitates phototunable, volatile modulation across nonvolatile configurations, allowing controlled resetting of the coupling states of the cavity. Here, the first nonvolatile, programmable terahertz topological integrated chip is demonstrated, offering flexible control over resonance modes. This advancement significantly paves the way for integrating phase change materials into silicon topological chips for programmable photonic devices, including interconnects, modulators, and logic circuits.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The actuation of stomata—referring to their opening and closing—is crucial for photosynthesis because it regulates gas exchange and water balance. Here, it is investigated if this life‐like property could enhance the photocatalytic properties of soft materials. A hybrid supramolecular and covalent polymer hydrogel is developed to integrate photocatalytic chromophores and stimuli‐responsive properties for controlling or improving light‐driven superoxide or hydrogen peroxide generation.








Abstract
Mechanical expansion and contraction of pores within photosynthetic organisms regulate a series of processes that are necessary to manage light absorption, control gas exchange, and regulate water loss. These pores, known as stoma, allow the plant to maximize photosynthetic output depending on environmental conditions such as light intensity, humidity, and temperature by actively changing the size of the stomal opening. Despite advances in artificial photosynthetic systems, little is known about the effect of such mechanical actuation in synthetic materials where chemical reactions occur. It is reported here on a hybrid hydrogel that combines light‐activated supramolecular polymers for superoxide production with thermal mechanical actuation of a covalent polymer. Superoxide production is important in organic synthesis and environmental remediation, and is a potential precursor to hydrogen peroxide liquid fuel. It is shown that the closing of pores in the hybrid hydrogel results in a substantial decrease in photocatalysis, but cycles of swollen and contracted states enhance photocatalysis. The observations motivate the development of biomimetic photosynthetic materials that integrate large scale motion and chemical reactions.

A novel multifunctional fiber energy storage device consisting of LMO‐LTP‐AC is developed by the coating‐extrusion method. Due to the continuous preparation process, devices exhibited an ultra‐high production rate of 6000 km year−1. This innovative approach significantly enhanced the device performance, achieving a specific capacity of 89.4 mAh g−1 for fiber batteries and rate performance of 20 C for fiber hybrid supercapacitors.








Abstract
The rise of wearable electronics demands flexible energy storage solutions like flexible fiber energy storage devices (FESDs), known for their flexibility and portability. However, it remains difficult for existing fabrication methods (typically, finite‐coating, thermal‐drawing, and solution‐extrusion) to simultaneously achieve desirable electrochemical performances and fast production of FESDs. Here, a new scalable coating‐extrusion method is developed, utilizing a novel extruded spinneret with tapered apertures to create dual pressure zones. These attributes reduced porosity, enhanced electrode materials loading, and stabilized the interface between the fiber electrode and gel electrolyte of FESDs, enabling the integration of three functional electrodes for the fabrication of both fiber LMO‐LTP batteries and fiber LMO/LTP‐AC hybrid supercapacitor within a single energy storage device. The resultant multifunctional device achieved a high specific capacity of 89.4 mAh g−1 in battery mode and demonstrated excellent rate performance of 20 C with nearly 50% capacity retention in supercapacitor mode, with a production rate of 6000 km year−1.

<title>Negative Enthalpy Doping Stabilizes P2‐Type Oxides Cathode for High‐Performance Sodium‐Ion Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A negative enthalpy doping strategy can significantly increase its in‐plane stability of the transition metal layer, which considerably suppresses destructive P2 to O2 phase transition and reduces lattice distortion, stabilizing the cycling performance of P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode for sodium‐ion batteries.








Abstract
P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) as cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) largely suffers from continuous accumulation of local stress caused by destructive structural evolution and irreversible oxygen loss upon cycling, leading to rapid capacity degradation. Herein, a strategy of negative enthalpy doping (NED), wherein transition metal (TM) sites are substituted with 0.01 mol each Sn, Sb, Cu, Ti, Mg, and Zn to increase the stability of the TM layers, is proposed. The robust structure of NED‐NNMO significantly suppresses the P2 to O2 phase transition and improves the Na+ kinetics upon long‐term cycling. Consequently, the NED‐NNMO exhibits much smoothened voltage platforms and improved oxygen redox reversibility, thus considerably extended lifetime as compared with the pristine NNMO sample. The NED‐NNMO delivers a high capacity of 138.9 mAh g−1 with an operation voltage of 3.51 V under 0.1 C and prominent capacity retention of 94.6% after 100 cycles under 1 C, and 90.0% over 3000 cycles under ultra‐high rate of 30 C, which is among the best over previous reports. Moreover, an ampere‐hour scale pouch cell based on the NED‐NNMO demonstrates an energy density of 139 Wh kg−1. This work sheds light on a route of negative enthalpy doping to design high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.

<title>High‐Capacity Volumetric Methane Storage in Hyper‐Cross‐Linked Porous Polymers via Flexibility Engineering of Building Units</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An unprecedented flexible porous polymer HCP‐DPP, constructed by the flexible building unit with the rigid external crosslinker, achieves a desirable trade‐off between porosity and density while displaying an unusual gate‐opening effect; which set a record‐high volumetric methane storage capacity among reported adsorbents, revealing a great promise for flexible hyper‐cross‐linked polymers in methane storage applications.








Abstract
Adsorbed natural gas (ANG) storage is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional compressed and liquefied storage methods. However, its onboard application is restricted by low volumetric methane storage capacity. Flexible porous adsorbents offer a potential solution, as their dense structures and unique gate‐opening effects are well‐suited to enhance volumetric capacity under high pressures. This study developes a series of hyper‐cross‐linked polymers (HCPs) with tunable flexibility by modifying the aliphatic chain length in double‐benzene‐ring building blocks, employing a cost‐effective external crosslinking approach. The resulting flexible polymer, HCP‐DPP, exhibits pore expansion under specific methane pressures, producing a high‐pressure adsorption isotherm with gate‐opening behavior. Combined with its intrinsic dense skeleton, this feature leads to superior volumetric methane storage performance over rigid counterparts. Notably, HCP‐DPP achieves a record‐high volumetric total uptake of 333 cm3 STP cm−3 and a working capacity of 291 cm3 STP cm−3 at 273 K and 100 bar, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) target of 263 cm3 STP cm−3. These findings lay a foundation for developing advanced flexible porous adsorbents for practical ANG applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents an effective strategy to address a longstanding challenge in the practical application of soft bioelectrodes: integrating excellent electrical performance, high compactness, and environmental durability. By leveraging the synergy between holey graphene and conductive polymer, this approach realizes reliable electron‐ion transduction through the construction of robust ionic and electronic transfer pathways at the molecular level.








Abstract
Bioelectrodes function as a critical interface for signal transduction between living organisms and electronics. Conducting polymers (CPs), particularly poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), are among the most promising materials for bioelectrodes, due to their electrical performance, high compactness, and ease of processing, but often suffer from degradation or de‐doping even in some common environments (e.g., electrical stimulation, chemicals, and high temperatures). This instability therefore severely undermines their reliability in practical application. To resolve this critical issue, a novel strategy of separating electron transfer from electron‐ion transduction is proposed. Specifically, chemically derived holey graphene (HG), serving as an ultra‐stable mixed ion‐electron conductor, is introduced into the CP matrix. The HG can restore the CP's destructed conductive pathways, whilst its porosity and its intercalation by the CP synergically preserve fast ionic and molecular diffusion. The resulting bioelectrode therefore exhibits excellent low impedance, high charge injection capacity, electrochemical activity, and outstanding resilience to various harsh conditions, outperforming HG, reduced graphene oxide, CP, or graphene‐coated CP electrodes. Furthermore, this strategy also exhibits broad compatibility with various processing techniques and proves adaptable to other electrode systems, such as stretchable electrodes, paving the way for practical applications in electrophysical capture, neuron modulation, and biochemical analysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The c‐B‐Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium–sulfur batteries. Consequently, c‐B‐Mo2C‐based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure–activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron‐deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h‐Mo2C) to cubic phase (c‐B‐Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron‐rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c‐B‐Mo2C based cell achieves a low‐capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm−2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah‐c‐B‐Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg−1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 µL mg S−1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg−1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Base editing using nanoneedles efficiently corrects pathogenic variants in the type VII collagen gene of primary fibroblasts from patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Nanoneedle editing induces minimal and reversible transcriptional perturbations while restoring the production and secretion of functional type VII collagen. The study highlights the value of nanoneedles as a tool for base editing in cell therapies for genetic disorders.








Abstract
Base editing, a CRISPR‐based genome editing technology, enables precise correction of single‐nucleotide variants, promising resolutive treatment for monogenic genetic disorders like recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). However, the application of base editors in cell manufacturing is hindered by inconsistent efficiency and high costs, contributed by suboptimal delivery methods. Nanoneedles have emerged as an effective delivery approach, enabling highly efficient, non‐perturbing gene therapies both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that nanoneedle delivery of an adenine base editor corrects a heterozygous single‐nucleotide pathogenic variant in COL7A1 in primary RDEB fibroblasts in vitro with 96.5% efficiency, without inducing off‐target variants. The nanoneedle delivery maintains cell viability and displays modest phenotypical alterations unlike conventional cationic lipid transfection. The nanoneedle‐mediated editing significantly increases the production and secretion of full‐length type VII collagen protein, contributing to restore functional fibroblasts phenotype by improving cell adhesion. These findings underscore the suitability and safety of nanoneedles for gene editing in a clinically relevant context of cell manufacturing, establishing a foundation for their use in cell therapies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work proposes an in‐situ self‐welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure‐sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home‐based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in‐situ self‐welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., ≈700 J m−2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure‐sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long‐term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning‐assisted system using t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home‐based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.

In this work, the architecture of a plant fiber cell wall is simplified to design novel concepts of 4D printed tubular moisture‐driven structural actuators, using the hygromorphic properties of continuous flax fiber (cFF) reinforced materials named meta biocomposites. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device.








Abstract
Biological structures provide inspiration for developing advanced materials from sustainable resources, enabling passive structural morphing. Despite an increasing interest for parsimony‐oriented innovation, sustainable shape‐changing materials based on renewable resources remain underexplored. In this work, the architecture of a single plant fiber cell wall (S2, for instance) is simplified to design novel concepts of 4D printed tubular moisture‐driven structural actuators, using the hygromorphic properties of continuous flax fiber (cFF) reinforced materials. This new class of bioinspired active materials is referred to as metabiocomposites. Before bioinspired design, the materials are produced with a customized rotary 3D printer, qualified, and tested for sorption behavior. A parametric experimental, analytical, and FEA analysis highlights the programmability of the material through the effects of mesostructural parameters (printing inclination α) and geometric factors (operational length L, inner diameter D, and thickness h) on the actuation authority. The overall performance is a trade‐off between rotation and torque, with energy density comparable to that of the source of inspiration: natural fibers cell wall. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device, such as a solar tracker.

<title>Hydrogel‐Impregnated Robust Interlocking Nano Connector (HiRINC) for Noninvasive Anti‐Migration of Esophageal Stent</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414944?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The development of hydrogel‐impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) aims to address stent migration by improving tissue adhesion and reducing mechanical mismatch in self‐expandable metallic stents (SEMSs). The network‐like porous layer of HiRINC enhances adhesion and energy dissipation, demonstrates through ex vivo and in vivo tests, effectively preventing migration in esophageal models.








Abstract
Migration of implanted self‐expandable metallic stent (SEMS) in the malignant or benign esophageal stricture is a common complication but not yet resolved. Herein, this research develops a hydrogel‐impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) to ensure adhesion and reduce the mechanical mismatch between SEMSs and esophageal tissues. Featuring a network‐like porous layer, HiRINC significantly enhances adhesion and energy dissipation during esophageal peristalsis by utilizing mechanical interlocking and increasing hydrogen bonding sites, thereby securing SEMS to tissues. The anti‐swelling property of HiRINC prevents excessive hydrogel expansion, avoiding esophageal blockage. Ex vivo and in vivo adhesion tests confirm that the HiRINC outperforms flat surfaces without RINC structures and effectively prevents stent migration. HiRINC‐coated SEMS maintains its position and luminal patency, minimizing stent‐induced tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory responses in rat and porcine esophageal models during the 4‐week follow‐up. This novel HiRINC‐SEMS can ensure anti‐migration and prolonged stent patency in the rat and porcine esophagus and seems to be expanded to other nonvascular luminal organs and various implantable metallic devices.

<title>Amorphous High‐entropy Phosphide Nanosheets With Multi‐atom Catalytic Sites for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202410295?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202410295?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A controllable electrodeposition combined phosphorization method is reported to synthesize a high‐entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. The Fe and Co/Ni sites in FeCoNiCuYP preferentially stabilize HO* and HOO* intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), disrupting the traditional scaling relation of Gibbs free energy for these intermediates. The FeCoNiCuYP/C demonstrates excellent OER performance, requiring low overpotentials of 316 mV@100 mA cm−2.








Abstract
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mainly encompasses four elementary reactions, involving intermediates such as HO*, O*, and HOO*. Balancing the Gibbs free energies of these intermediates at a single active site is a challenging task. In this work, a high‐entropy metal‐organic framework incorporating Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Y metal elements is synthesized using an electrodeposition method, which then serves as a template for preparing a high‐entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine‐tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm−2 current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high‐entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting‐edge electrocatalytic applications.

Printed electronics, with their extensive versatility, resource efficiency, and fast‐prototyping capabilities, offer an attractive alternative to Si‐based CMOS technology. This paper reviews the recent advances in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies that could lead to high performance, as well as attributes such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and vertical stack leading to 3D integration.








Abstract
The pursuit of miniaturized Si electronics has revolutionized computing and communication. During recent years, the value addition in electronics has also been achieved through printing, flexible and stretchable electronics form factors, and integration over areas larger than wafer size. Unlike Si semiconductor manufacturing which takes months from tape‐out to wafer production, printed electronics offers greater flexibility and fast‐prototyping capabilities with lesser resources and waste generation. While significant advances have been made with various types of printed sensors and other passive devices, printed circuits still lag behind Si‐based electronics in terms of performance, integration density, and functionality. In this regard, recent advances using high‐resolution printing coupled with the use of high mobility materials and device engineering, for both in‐plane and out‐of‐plane integration, raise hopes. This paper focuses on the progress in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies and related aspects such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and the novel functionalities enabled by vertical integration of printed electronics. By highlighting these advances, this paper intends to reveal the future promise of printed electronics as a sustainable and resource‐efficient route for realizing high‐performance integrated circuits and systems.

Abstract
Higher and richer nutrient requirements are typical features that distinguish tumor cells from AU: cells, ensuring adequate substrates and energy sources for tumor cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, nutrient deprivation strategies based on targeted technologies can induce impaired cell viability in tumor cells, which are more sensitive than normal cells. In this review, nutrients that are required by tumor cells and related metabolic pathways are introduced, and anti‐tumor strategies developed to target nutrient deprivation are described. In addition to tumor cells, the nutritional and metabolic characteristics of other cells in the tumor microenvironment (including macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, T cells, and cancer‐associated fibroblasts) and related new anti‐tumor strategies are also summarized. In conclusion, recent advances in anti‐tumor strategies targeting nutrient blockade are reviewed, and the challenges and prospects of these anti‐tumor strategies are discussed, which are of theoretical significance for optimizing the clinical application of tumor nutrition deprivation strategies.

Recent advances in operando characterizations and computational simulations have unveiled the unconventional and dynamic nature of surface‐bound reaction intermediates in aqueous electrochemical systems. By tailoring electronic properties and atomic structures of catalytic surfaces, researchers can manipulate adsorbate dynamics to enable energetically favorable reaction pathways, overcoming the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints inherent in conventional reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalysts to accelerate sluggish electrode reactions is critical for the deployment of sustainable aqueous electrochemical technologies, yet remains a great challenge. Rationally integrating functional components to tailor surface adsorption behaviors and adsorbate dynamics would divert reaction pathways and alleviate energy barriers, eliminating conventional thermodynamic constraints and ultimately optimizing energy flow within electrochemical systems. This approach has, therefore, garnered significant interest, presenting substantial potential for developing highly efficient catalysts that simultaneously enhance activity, selectivity, and stability. The immense promise and rapid evolution of this design strategy, however, do not overshadow the substantial challenges and ambiguities that persist, impeding the realization of significant breakthroughs in electrocatalyst development. This review explores the latest insights into the principles guiding the design of catalytic surfaces that enable favorable adsorbate dynamics within the contexts of hydrogen and oxygen electrochemistry. Innovative approaches for tailoring adsorbate‐surface interactions are discussed, delving into underlying principles that govern these dynamics. Additionally, perspectives on the prevailing challenges are presented and future research directions are proposed. By evaluating the core principles and identifying critical research gaps, this review seeks to inspire rational electrocatalyst design, the discovery of novel reaction mechanisms and concepts, and ultimately, advance the large‐scale implementation of electroconversion technologies.

Recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc‐inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed, and the four proton storage reaction patterns, the proton storage, and transport processes are well refined. The characterization techniques of proton storage are carefully introduced. Especially, the four structural engineering of proton storage modulation are highlighted.








Abstract
The proton (H+) has been proved to be another important energy storage ion besides Zn2+ in aqueous zinc‐inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes. H+ storage usually possesses better thermodynamics and reaction kinetics than Zn2+, and is found to be an important addition for Zn2+ storage. Thus, understanding, characterizing, and modulating H+ storage in inorganic cathode materials is particularly important. In this review, recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc‐inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed. First, the four proton storage reaction patterns of H+ insertion, H+/Zn2+ co‐insertion, H+‐dependent conversion, and H+‐dependent dissolution/deposition reaction are explicitly presented. Meanwhile, the proton storage processes of multi‐sites and multi‐steps, and the Hopping and Grotthuss proton transport mechanisms are carefully introduced. Second, the characterization techniques of proton storage are systematically classified into four types of electrochemical characterization techniques of batteries, structural characterization techniques of inorganic cathodes, pH characterization technique of electrolyte, and quantitative analysis technologies of H+ storage contribution. Third, the structural engineering of proton storage modulation is preliminarily refined to be interlayer engineering, doping engineering, defect engineering, composite engineering, and other engineering. Finally, the emerging challenges and perspectives about future directions of proton storage chemistry are proposed.

Abstract
Overproduction of pathogenic cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays crucial roles in the onset and perpetuation of ulcerative colitis (UC). Inspired by sweeping robots, a magnesium@polylactic acid‐glycolic acid copolymer@polyethylenimine (Mg@PLGA@PEI) microswimmer capable of cleaning off deleterious disease triggers along its path of progress is designed. Mg@PLGA@PEI is successfully synthesized by adopting a core‐shell structure with a small opening which allows for Mg‐water reaction. The distinctive motility performance resulting from sustained detachment of the produced hydrogen not only contributes to strengthened hydrogen diffusion concomitant with potentiated ROS neutralization, but also facilitates the contacting probability with microenvironmental cfDNA and thus enhances the DNA binding efficiency. By integrating these merits, the developed Mg@PLGA@PEI confers desirable curative efficacy in a classical DSS‐induced acute colitis mouse model. Enema administration of Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmers substantially alleviates the manifestations related to UC, as evidenced by the body weight recovery, colon length retention, colon tissue protection, and attenuated intestinal inflammation, which is attributed to the active scavenging of cfDNA and ROS. This work provides a paradigm for a drug‐free strategy competent in spontaneously eliminating causative triggers with minimal side effects, which presents a promising alternative for the active therapy of UC or other cfDNA‐ and ROS‐related diseases in the clinic.

<title>Tissue Mimetic Membranes for Healing Augmentation of Tendon–Bone Interface in Rotator Cuff Repair</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here, a tissue‐mimetic membrane for functional tendon–bone interface regeneration is fabricated. During the implantation, a biomimicry and inductive microenvironment is created by the region‐specific configuration and spatiotemporal release of chondroinductive kartogenin‐conjugated nanogel (nGel‐KGN) and osteoinductive struvite. The In Vitro and in vivo findings validate the prominent regenerative efficacy in rotator cuff repair.








Abstract
The globally prevalent rotator cuff tear has a high re‐rupture rate, attributing to the failure to reproduce the interfacial fibrocartilaginous enthesis. Herein, a hierarchically organized membrane is developed that mimics the heterogeneous anatomy and properties of the natural enthesis and finely facilitates the reconstruction of tendon–bone interface. A biphasic membrane consisting of a microporous layer and a mineralized fibrous layer is constructed through the non‐solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) strategy followed by a co‐axial electrospinning procedure. Cationic kartogenin (KGN)‐conjugated nanogel (nGel‐KGN) and osteo‐promotive struvite are incorporated within the membranes in a region‐specific manner. During in vivo repair, the nGel‐KGN‐functionalized microporous layer is adjacent to the tendon which intends to suppress scar tissue formation at the lesion and simultaneously heightens chondrogenesis. Meanwhile, the struvite‐containing fibrous layer covers the tubercula minus to enhance stem cell aggregation and bony ingrowth. Such tissue‐specific features and spatiotemporal release behaviors contribute to effective guidance of specific defect‐healing events at the transitional region, further leading to the remarkably promoted regenerative outcome in terms of the fibrocartilaginous tissue formation, collagen fiber alignment, and optimized functional motion of rotator cuff. These findings render a novel biomimetic membrane as a promising material for clinical rotator cuff repair.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for advanced high‐power capacitors. Atomic‐scale investigations determine that introduction of specific elements (Mg, La, Ca, and Sr) can enhance ferroelectric relaxation behavior by different magnitudes. Disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall polar nanoscale regions are detected in the high‐entropy ceramics after introducing trace amounts of Mg and La. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J cm−3 and efficiency of 90% are achieved in a designed high‐entropy ceramic.








Abstract
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for the development of advanced high‐power capacitors. However, achieving ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density and efficiency remains challenging, limiting the progress of leading‐edge energy storage applications. In this study, (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3 (BNT) is selected as the matrix, and the effects of different A‐site elements on domain morphology, lattice polarization, and dielectric and ferroelectric properties are systematically investigated. Mg, La, Ca, and Sr are shown to enhance relaxation behavior by different magnitudes; hence, a high‐entropy strategy for designing local polymorphic distortions is proposed. Based on atomic‐scale investigations, a series of BNT‐based high‐entropy compositions are designed by introducing trace amounts of Mg and La to improve the electric breakdown strength and further disrupt the polar nanoscale regions (PNRs). A disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall PNRs with a minimum size of ≈1 nm are detected in the high‐entropy ceramics. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J cm−3 and an efficiency of 90% are achieved for (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2Mg0.05La0.05Bi0.15Na0.15)TiO3. Furthermore, it displays a high‐power density of 584 MW cm−3 and an ultrashort discharge time of 27 ns. This work presents an effective approach for designing dielectric energy storage materials with superior comprehensive performance via a high‐entropy strategy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Paving the way towards 3D light‐based (bio)printing with spatiotemporal control over structural and mechanical properties—Xolography of hydrogel‐based photoresins enables the fabrication of high‐resolution constructs with locally modulated stiffness and programmable shape changes.








Abstract
Current challenges in tissue engineering include creation of extracellular environments that support and interact with cells using biochemical, mechanical, and structural cues. Spatial control over these cues is currently limited due to a lack of suitable fabrication techniques. This study introduces Xolography, an emerging dual‐color light‐sheet volumetric printing technology, to achieve control over structural and mechanical features for hydrogel‐based photoresins at micro‐ to macroscale while printing within minutes. A water‐soluble photoswitch photoinitiator system and a library of naturally‐derived, synthetic, and thermoresponsive hydrogels for Xolography are proposed. Centimeter‐scale, 3D constructs with positive features of 20 µm and negative features of ≈100 µm are fabricated with control over mechanical properties (compressive moduli 0.2 kPa–6.5 MPa). Notably, switching from binary to grayscaled light projection enables spatial control over stiffness (0.2–16 kPa). As a proof of concept, grayscaled Xolography is leveraged with thermoresponsive hydrogels to introduce reversible anisotropic shape changes beyond isometric shrinkage. Xolography of viable cell aggregates is finally demonstrated, laying the foundation for cell‐laden printing of dynamic, cell‐instructive environments with tunable structural and mechanical cues in a fast one‐step process. Overall, these innovations unlock unique possibilities of Xolography across multiple biomedical applications.

<title>Regio‐Selective Mechanical Enhancement of Polymer‐Grafted Nanoparticle Composites via Light‐Mediated Crosslinking</title>

<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202410493?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Light‐mediated crosslinkers are incorporated into a polymer‐grafted nanoparticle composite system. This method enables >15‐fold enhancement of tensile modulus upon crosslinking and can be applied to a wide range of monomer compositions. Furthermore, the regio‐selective nature of photocrosslinking allows for the fabrication of compositionally continuous composites with intentionally designed anisotropic mechanical responses, demonstrated via the fabrication of a stiffness‐patterned soft electronic substrate.








Abstract
Polymer‐brush‐grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs) that can be covalently crosslinked post‐processing enable the fabrication of mechanically robust and chemically stable polymer nanocomposites with high inorganic filler content. Modifying PGNP brushes to append UV‐activated crosslinkers along the polymer chains would permit a modular crosslinking strategy applicable to a diverse range of nanocomposite compositions. Further, light‐activated crosslinking reactions enable spatial control of crosslink density to program intentionally inhomogeneous mechanical responses. Here, a method of synthesizing composites using UV‐crosslinkable brush‐coated nanoparticles (referred to as UV‐XNPs) is introduced that can be applied to various monomer compositions by incorporating photoinitiators into the polymer brushes. UV crosslinking of processed UV‐XNP structures can increase their tensile modulus up to 15‐fold without any noticeable alteration to their appearance or shape. By using photomasks to alter UV intensity across a sample, intentionally designed inhomogeneities in crosslink density result in predetermined anisotropic shape changes under strain. This unique capability of UV‐XNP materials is applied to stiffness‐patterned flexible electronic substrates that prevent the delamination of rigid components under deformation. The potential of UV‐XNPs as functional, soft device components is further demonstrated by wearable devices that can be modified post‐fabrication to customize their performance, permitting the ability to add functionality to existing device architectures.

The 2D Cr5Te6 nanosheets are systematically synthesized with an in situ formed ≈2 nm‐thick Te doped Cr2O3 layer (Te‐Cr2O3) on the upper surface by chemical vapor deposition method. The strong and air stable EB effect, achieving a |HEB/HC| of up to 80% under an ultralow cooling field of 0.01 T, which is greater than that of the reported 2D magnetic heterostructures.








Abstract
The exchange bias (EB) effect is a fundamental magnetic phenomenon, in which the exchange bias field/coercive field ratio (|HEB/HC|) can improve the stability of spintronic devices. Two‐dimensional (2D) magnetic heterostructures have the potential to construct low‐power and high‐density spintronic devices, while their typically air unstable and |HEB/HC| lesser, limiting the possibility of applications. Here, 2D Cr5Te6 nanosheets have been systematically synthesized with an in situ formed ≈2 nm‐thick Te doped Cr2O3 layer (Te‐Cr2O3) on the upper surface by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The strong and air stable EB effect, achieving a |HEB/HC| of up to 80% under an ultralow cooling field of 0.01 T, which is greater than that of the reported 2D magnetic heterostructures. Meanwhile, the uniformity of thickness and chemical composition of the Te‐Cr2O3 layer can be controlled by the growth conditions which are highly correlated with the EB effect of 2D Te‐Cr2O3/Cr5Te6 heterostructures. First‐principles calculations show that the Te‐Cr2O3 can provide uncompensated spins in the Cr2O3, thus forming strong spin pinning effect. The systematical investigation of the EB effect in 2D Te‐Cr2O3/Cr5Te6 heterostructures with high |HEB/HC| will open up exciting opportunities in low‐power and high‐stability 2D spintronic devices.

<title>Heterodimeric Photosensitizer as Radical Generators to Promoting Type I Photodynamic Conversion for Hypoxic Tumor Therapy</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202410992?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202410992?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In heterodimeric NBSSe, the NBS/NBSe radical pair formation in the co‐excited NBSSe* after intramolecular electron transfer successfully converts type II into type I photodynamic pathway on a traditional type II photosensitizer NBSe of high reactive oxygen species yield. Incorporating electron‐rich BSA further promotes O2‐· generation and photostability of this radical generator via recycling radicals, with an efficient tumor targeting capability for BSA@NBSSe.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using traditional type II photosensitizers (PSs) has been limited in hypoxic tumors due to excessive oxygen consumption. The conversion from type II into a less oxygen‐dependent type I PDT pathway has shown the potential to combat hypoxic tumors. Herein, the design of a heterodimeric PS, NBSSe, by conjugating a widely used type I PS NBS and a type II PS NBSe via molecular dimerization, achieving the aggregation‐regulated efficient type I photodynamic conversion for the first time is reported. Electrochemistry characterizations and theoretical calculations elucidate that NBSSe tends to form a S+·/Se−· radical pair via intramolecular electron transfer in the co‐excited NBSSe* aggregate, realizing 7.25‐fold O2−· generation compared to NBS and 80% suppression of 1O2 generation compared to NBSe. The enhanced O2−· generation of NBSSe enables excellent anti‐hypoxia PDT efficiency and inhibition of pulmonary metastasis. Additionally, the incorporation of electron‐rich bovine serum albumin accelerates the recycling of cationic PS radical NBSSe+·, further boosting photostability and O2−· generation. The resultant BSA@NBSSe nanoparticles demonstrate successful tumor‐targeting PDT capability. This work provides an appealing avenue to convert ROS generation from the type II pathway to the type I pathway for efficient cancer phototherapy in hypoxia.

<title>Self‐assembled Gap‐Rich PdMn Nanofibers with High Mass/Electron Transport Highways for Electrocatalytic Reforming of Waste Plastics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A unique self‐assembled gap‐rich PdMn nanofibers, featuring with high mass/electron transport highways, which is used as an efficient catalyst of polyethylene terephthalate to high‐valued glycolic acid at an industrial current.








Abstract
Innovating nanocatalysts with both high intrinsic catalytic activity and high selectivity is crucial for multi‐electron reactions, however, their low mass/electron transport at industrial‐level currents is often overlooked, which usually leads to low comprehensive performance at the device level. Herein, a Cl−/O2 etching‐assisted self‐assembly strategy is reported for synthesizing a self‐assembled gap‐rich PdMn nanofibers with high mass/electron transport highway for greatly enhancing the electrocatalytic reforming of waste plastics at industrial‐level currents. The self‐assembled PdMn nanofiber shows excellent catalytic activity in upcycling waste plastics into glycolic acid, with a high current density of 223 mA cm−2@0.75 V (vs RHE), high selectivity (95.6%), and Faraday efficiency (94.3%) to glycolic acid in a flow electrolyzer. Density functional theory calculation, X‐ray absorption spectroscopy combined with in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of highly oxophilic Mn induces a downshift of the d‐band center of Pd, which optimizes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates on PdMn surface, thereby facilitating the desorption of glycolic acid as a high‐value product. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirm that the gap‐rich nanofiber structure is conducive for mass transfer to deliver an industrial‐level current.

<title>PerC B‐Cells Activation via Thermogenetics‐Based CXCL12 Generator for Intraperitoneal Immunity Against Metastatic Disseminated Tumor Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An isotropic‐porous, cell‐fitting, thermogenetics‐based chemokine CXCL12 generator is described as a B‐cell‐dependent intraperitoneal immunotherapy that can trigger intraperitoneal anti‐tumor immunity against metastatic disseminated tumor cell to assuage peritoneal effusion and peritoneal metastasis. Unexpectedly, the peritoneal cavity B cell subset is identified as playing a key role in exogenous antigen presentation and presenting a unique transcriptional signature.








Abstract
During cancer peritoneal metastasis (PM), conventional antigen‐presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) promote tumorigenesis and immunosuppression in peritoneal cavity. While intraperitoneal immunotherapy (IPIT) has been used in clinical investigations to relieve PM, the limited knowledge of peritoneal immunocytes has hindered the development of therapeutic IPIT. Here, a dendritic cell‐independent, next‐generation IPIT is described that activates peritoneal cavity B (PerC B) cell subsets for intraperitoneal anti‐tumor immunity via exogenous antigen presentation. The PerC B‐cell‐involved IPIT framework consists of an isotropic‐porous, cell‐fitting, thermogenetics‐based CXCL12 generator. Such nanoscale thermal‐confined generator can programmatically fine‐tune the expression of CXCL12 to recruit disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) through CXCL12‐CXCR4 axis while avoiding cytokine storm, subsequently release DTC‐derived antigen to trigger PerC B‐cell‐involved immunity. Notably, antigen‐presenting B‐cell cluster, expressing the regulatory signaling molecules Ptpn6, Ms4a1, and Cd52, is identified playing the key role in the IPIT via single‐cell RNA sequencing. Moreover, such IPIT availably assuages peritoneal effusion and PM in an orthotopic gastric cancer and metastatic model. Overall, this work offers a perspective on PerC B‐cell‐involved antigen‐presenting in intraperitoneal immunity and provides a configurable strategy for activating anti‐DTC immunity for next‐generation IPIT.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bio‐scaffolded lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli is developed as a simple, effective material for repeated capture and release of rare earth elements (REEs). Over 80% of four REE cations are captured, even in the presence of excess competitive ions. The material can be employed in a filtration flow‐through system with a capture capacity of 11.8 ± 0.9 mg g−1 dry cell weight.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for many clean energy technologies. Yet, they are a limited resource currently obtained through carbon‐intensive mining. Here, bio‐scaffolded proteins serve as simple, effective materials for the recovery of REEs. Surface expression of the protein lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli, followed by freeze‐drying of the microbes, yields a displayed protein material for REE recovery. Four REE cations (Y3+, La3+, Gd3+, and Tb3+) are captured efficiently, with over 80% recovery even in the presence of competitive ions at one‐hundred‐fold excess. Moreover, these materials are readily integrated into a filter with high capture capacity (12 mg g−1 dry cell weight) for the selective isolation and recovery of REEs from complex matrices. Further, the proteins in the filter remain stable over ten bind‐and‐release cycles and a week of storage. To improve the deployability of this filter material, a simple colorimetric assay with the dye alizarin‐3‐methyliminodiacetic acid is incorporated. The assay can be performed in under 5 min, enabling rapid monitoring of REE recovery and filter efficiency. Overall, this low‐cost, robust material will enable environmentally friendly recycling and recovery of critical elements.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
LNP is modified by a novel STING‐activating polymer (PD) to enhance immune effect of mRNA vaccines by boosting cellular uptake and triggering robust immune activation. Optimizing the polymerization of PD significantly amplifies mRNA translation efficiency and STING‐mediated immune responses, offering a powerful approach to advance mRNA‐based immunotherapy.









Abstract
The unprecedented success of mRNA vaccines against COVID‐19 has inspired scientists to develop mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. However, using nucleoside modified mRNA as vaccine, though evading innate immune toxicity, diminishes its therapeutic efficacy for cancers. Here, we report a polyvalent stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activating polymer (termed as PD) to bolster the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine. PD is made of tertiary amine units and conjugated with a biodegradable alkyl chain. Co‐formulation of PDs bearing different number of tertiary amines with lipid materials and mRNA resulted in the lipid‐like nanoparticles (PD LNPs) which effectively promoted lymphatic delivery and elicited robust immune activation via the STING signaling pathway. Notably, PD with eighteen tertiary amines (PD18) is predominant in balancing immune activity and tolerability. Subcutaneous administration of PD18 LNPs containing ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA enhanced the frequency of antigen specific CD8+ T cell with immune memory, leading to potent anticancer efficacy that surpassed 2′3’‐cGAMP in both prophylactic and therapeutic cancer models. Additionally, PD18 LNP‐based mRNA vaccine showed conferred resistance to cancer challenge for up to 60 days. Overall, this study offers a new perspective of using STING‐ activating polymer for imparting synergistic activity in mRNA vaccine‐based cancer immunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) is developed for advanced molecular classification of processing multiple inputs. By minimizing oligonucleotide requirements, DDSD enables binary and multiclass molecular classification in a simplified manner. It has been successfully applied in infection diagnostics and pathogen identification using blood samples. Computing capability can be further enhanced by cascade DDSD and multiway junction DDSD.








Abstract
DNA‐based molecular computing systems for biomarkers have emerged as powerful tools for intelligent diagnostics. However, with the variety of feature biomarkers expanding, current molecular computing systems suffer from the use of a large number of oligonucleotides and limited encoding capability. Here, the study develops an alternative molecular computing approach termed Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) which recognizes targets and operates target valence through DNA polymerase‐based extension and strand release. DDSD significantly reduced the number of used oligonucleotide species, provided robust molecular classifiers. In clinical blood samples, a 96% accuracy rate is achieved with a DDSD‐based binary classifier for distinguishing bacterial and viral infections, a 100% accuracy rate is achieved with a multiclass classifier for identifying pathogen types, surpassing existing classifier systems. Moreover, DDSD can be readily expanded. Cascade DDSD is developed, enabling simultaneous computing of up to 14 valence states with a maximum valence of 25. Multiway junction DDSD is implemented to achieve high‐valence computing by compact DNA nanostructures rather than split DNA computing units, reducing the potential leakage. The implementation of DDSD enhances the capability of valence‐based intelligent molecular diagnostics and multiplexed biomarker detection.

<title>Electroactive Dressing with Selective Sorption of Exudate Enables Treatment of Complicated Wound</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electroactive dressing (cMO/PVA) designed via a facile bilayer composite approach and charging procedure integrates selective sorption, long‐term electrical stimulation therapy, and antibacterial properties simultaneously, showing an appealing application prospect for complicated wound repair.








Abstract
Exudate management and cell activity enhancement are vital to complicated wound healing. However, current exudate management dressings indiscriminately remove exudate, which is detrimental to cell activity enhancement. Herein, a novel class of electroactive bilayer (cMO/PVA) dressing is developed by constructing manganese oxide nanoneedle‐clusters decorated commercial carbon cloth (MO), in situ casting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, and finally charging. Benefitting from the hierarchical nanoneedle‐cluster structure of MO, abundant active sites are sufficiently exposed to achieve high area‐specific capacitances (e.g., 1881.3 mF cm−2), thereby establishing the long‐lasting electric field for cMO/PVA dressing. Such a unique cMO/PVA dressing can realize extraordinary selective sorption toward noxious substances over nutrient substances during exudate management. Meanwhile, its long‐term electrical stimulation therapy can promote cell proliferation and migration and enhance antibacterial property. As a result, our multifunctional cMO/PVA dressing can rapidly repair full‐thickness wounds in type II diabetic rats, offering an advanced strategy for the treatment of complicated wounds.

<title>The Role of Long‐Range Interactions Between High‐Entropy Single‐Atoms in Catalyzing Sulfur Conversion Reactions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Unveiling the mechanism of high‐entropy single‐atom catalysts (HESAC), this study reveals how long‐range interactions and entropy govern electron states, enhancing electrocatalysis for lithium–sulfur batteries with a superior rate capacity of 3.4 mAh cm−2 at 10 C.








Abstract
Sulfur conversion reactions are the foundation of lithium–sulfur batteries but usually possess sluggish kinetics during practical battery operation. Herein, a high‐entropy single‐atom catalyst (HESAC) is synthesized for this process. In contrast to conventional dual‐atom catalysts that form metal–metal bonds, the center metal atoms in HESAC are not bonded but exhibit long‐range interactions at a sub‐nanometer distance (<9 Å). The synergistic effect between the long‐range interactions and entropy changes enables the regulation of d‐ and π‐electron states. This alteration in the electronic structure improves the adsorption and electronic conductivity of intermediate polysulfides, thereby accelerating their conversion kinetics. Consequently, this leads to a significant enhancement in specific capacities by ≈40% at high rates compared to single‐atom catalysts. The resulting lithium–sulfur battery with HESAC demonstrates a remarkable areal capacity of 3.4 mAh cm−2 at 10 C. These findings provide valuable insights into the design principle of metal atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions.

<title>Efficient Spin‐Light‐Emitting Diodes With Tunable Red to Near‐Infrared Emission at Room Temperature</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A series of chiral quasi‐2D perovskites are reported with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in films and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in spin‐LEDs in the red to near‐infrared spectrum region. Spectroscopic studies show that the CPL and CPEL originate from an energy and spin funnel process in the chiral quasi‐2D perovskites.








Abstract
Spin light‐emitting diodes (spin‐LEDs) are important for spin‐based electronic circuits as they convert the carrier spin information to optical polarization. Recently, chiral‐induced spin selectivity (CISS) has emerged as a new paradigm to enable spin‐LED as it does not require any magnetic components and operates at room temperature. However, CISS‐enabled spin‐LED with tunable wavelengths ranging from red to near‐infrared (NIR) has yet to be demonstrated. Here, chiral quasi‐2D perovskites are developed to fabricate efficient spin‐LEDs with tunable wavelengths from red to NIR region by tuning the halide composition. The optimized chiral perovskite films exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence from 675 to 788 nm, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 86% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) ranging from 8.5 × 10−3 to 2.6 × 10−2. More importantly, direct circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is achieved at room temperature in spin‐LEDs. This work demonstrated efficient red and NIR spin‐LEDs with the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaching 12.4% and the electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (gEL) ranging from 3.7 × 10−3 to 1.48 × 10−2 at room temperature. The composition‐dependent CPEL performance is further attributed to the prolonged spin lifetime as revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy.

<title>Nucleation‐Controlled Crystallization of Chiral 2D Perovskite Single Crystal Thin Films for High‐Sensitivity Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A nucleation‐controlled strategy is developed, to grow Dion−Jacobson phase 2D chiral perovskite single crystal thin films (SCTFs), from water‐air interface, with a novel chiral ligand, (R/S)‐3‐Aminopyrrolidine. The obtained ultrathin SCTFs, with shortened spacing between inorganic layers, exhibit reduced exciton binding energy and enhanced carrier transport. In results, photodetectors based on the SCTFs show superior sensitivity to the circularly polarized light.








Abstract
2D Dion−Jacobson (DJ) chiral perovskite materials exhibit significant promise for developing high‐performance circularly polarized light (CPL) photodetectors. However, the inherently thick nature of DJ‐phase 2D perovskite single crystal limits their ability to differentiate CPL photons with the two opposite polarization states. In addition, the growth of DJ‐phase perovskite single crystal thin films (SCTFs) has proven challenging due to the strong interlayer electronic coupling. Here, a nucleation‐controlled strategy is employed to grow a novel DJ‐phase perovskite [(R/S)‐3APr]PbI4 [(R/S)‐3APr = (R/S)‐3‐Aminopyrrolidine] SCTFs with large area, low thickness and hence high aspect ratios. Structural and photoluminescence analyses reveal that introducing the divalent organic cations into the perovskite framework reduce the interlayer distance, resulting in low exciton binding energy. This facilitates charge separation and transport. The resulting SCTF photodetector showcases excellent detection performance with anisotropy factor for photocurrent as high as 0.65, responsivity of 1.97 A W−1, detectivity of 5.3 × 1013 Jones, and 3‐dB frequency of 2940 Hz, demonstrating its potential as a promising candidate for CPL‐sensitive photodetectors. This novel approach, therefore, provides a framework for the growth of DJ‐phase perovskite SCTFs and advances their applications in sensitive CPL photodetection.

<title>Influence of Free Space on Lithium Growth Behavior at Open Surfaces and Internal Cracks of Sulfide‐Based Solid Electrolyte</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lithium growth follows two modes within the crack of argyrodite sulfide solid electrolyte: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side‐wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side‐wall surface toward the free space inside the crack.








Abstract
Lithium dendrite penetration through solid electrolyte has been the major obstacle for practical sulfide‐based all‐solid‐state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). Herein, a series of tailored model solid cells are designed to investigate the intrinsic lithium growth behavior at open surfaces and internal cracks of sulfide solid electrolyte. It is shown that when plating lithium on the open surface of electrolyte (free space), the lithium exhibits an intrinsic columnar growth behavior perpendicular to the electrolyte surface, preferentially along the (110) crystal axis. When plating lithium within the internal cracks (confined free space), the growth of lithium follows two major modes: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side‐wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side‐wall surface toward the confined free space inside the crack. The extent of lithium ingress into electrolyte under external pressure in the initial state is found to determine the rate of lithium infiltration after applying the current. As a further validation, intact sintered electrolytes with 99% relative density minimize initial lithium ingress, enabling lithium plating at 6.37 mA cm−2 with an areal capacity exceeding 76 mAh cm−2 without short circuit.

<title>Ligand Inter‐Relation Analysis Via Graph Theory Predicts Macrophage Response</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Graph theory modeling of RGD nano inter‐relation inversely proportional to the shortest path distance and proportional to the corresponding number of possible instances is harnessed. RGD nano inter‐relation can be regulated by modulating the aspect ratio of magnetic nanobars, which can be increased by unidirectionally aligning or reversibly lifting magnetic nanobars, thereby promoting integrin‐bearing filopodia penetration and adhesion‐mediated pro‐regenerative polarization of host macrophages.








Abstract
Graph theory has been widely used to quantitatively analyze complex networks of molecules, materials, and cells. Analyzing the dynamic complex structure of extracellular matrix can predict cell‐material interactions but has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, graph theory‐based mathematical modeling of RGD ligand graph inter‐relation is demonstrated by differentially cutting off RGD‐to‐RGD interlinkages with flexibly conjugated magnetic nanobars (MNBs) with tunable aspect ratio. The RGD‐to‐RGD interlinkages are less effectively cut off by MNBs with a lower aspect ratio, which decreases the shortest path while increasing the number of instances thereof, thereby augmenting RGD nano inter‐relation. This facilitates integrin recruitment of macrophages and thus actin fiber assembly and vinculin expression, which mediates pro‐regenerative polarization, involving myosin II, actin polymerization, and rho‐associated protein kinase. Unidirectional pre‐aligning or reversibly lifting highly elongated MNBs both increase RGD nano inter‐relation, which promotes host macrophage adhesion and switches their polarization from pro‐inflammatory to pro‐regenerative phenotype. The latter approach produces nano‐spaces through which macrophages can penetrate and establish RGD links thereunder. Using graph theory, this study presents the example of mathematically modeling the functionality of extracellular‐matrix‐mimetic materials, which can help elucidate complex dynamics of the interactions occurring between host cells and materials via versatile geometrical nano‐engineering.

<title>Nanomagnetism Triggering Carriers Double‐Resistance Conduction and Excellent Flexible Thermoelectrics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nanomagnetism‐triggered double‐resistance conduction greatly enhances thermoelectric performance of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/epoxy films with a maximum zT of 1.44 at 320 K, providing insights into magnetism‐enhanced thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Nanomagnetism may enable electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient to be decoupled and can potentially lead to remarkable enhancements in thermoelectric (TE) performance, however, their physical mechanisms have not been explored. Herein, it is shown that the nanomagnetism from Fe and Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/epoxy flexible films can lead to the carriers splitting into spin‐up and spin‐down conductive branches with different resistances and mobilities due to the exchange interaction between the spin of carriers and the nanomagnetism. The double‐resistance conduction of carriers may well explain the decoupling of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient and their simultaneous enhancements in the thermo‐electro‐magnetic flexible films. It is further shown that the maximum dimensionless figure of merit of the thermo‐electro‐magnetic flexible films reaches between 1.2 and 1.4 at room temperature, and their five‐level cascaded device based on the films achieves a temperature drop of 3.1 K through in‐plane heat dissipation, making a new record for printing flexible TE films and devices. The double‐resistance conduction of carriers also reveals a deep physical mechanism for magneto‐enhanced TE performance of bulk thermoelectrics.

<title>Oriented Cortical‐Bone‐Like Silk Protein Lamellae Effectively Repair Large Segmental Bone Defects in Pigs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Silk proteins can be fabricated into large scaffolds with cortical‐bone‐like lamellar structures through freeze‐casting. The resultant freeze‐cast scaffolds are made of parallel silk protein lamellae and can be implanted into pig models to achieve effective bone regeneration without side effects.









Abstract
Assembling natural proteins into large, strong, bone‐mimetic scaffolds for repairing bone defects in large‐animal load‐bearing sites remain elusive. Here this challenge is tackled by assembling pure silk fibroin (SF) into 3D scaffolds with cortical‐bone‐like lamellae, superior strength, and biodegradability through freeze‐casting. The unique lamellae promote the attachment, migration, and proliferation of tissue‐regenerative cells (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] and human umbilical vein endothelial cells) around them, and are capable of developing in vitro into cortical‐bone organoids with a high number of MSC‐derived osteoblasts. High‐SF‐content lamellar scaffolds, regardless of MSC inoculation, regenerated more bone than non‐lamellar or low‐SF‐content lamellar scaffolds. They accelerated neovascularization by transforming macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, promoting bone regeneration to repair large segmental bone defects (LSBD) in minipigs within three months, even without growth factor supplements. The bone regeneration can be further enhanced by controlling the orientation of the lamella to be parallel to the long axis of bone during implantation. This work demonstrates the power of oriented lamellar bone‐like protein scaffolds in repairing LSBD in large animal models.

<title>Advancing Room‐Temperature Magnetic Semiconductors with Organic Radical Charge Transfer Cocrystals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pure organic room‐temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors are constructed in organic radical cocrystals by a simple solution‐process method. It is suggested that the primary sources of the boosting in magnetic and electrical properties are the enhancement of charge‐transfer interactions induced by radicals.








Abstract
Developing purely organic room‐temperature magnetic semiconductors has been a long‐sought goal in the material community toward the simultaneous control of spin and charge. Organic cocrystals, known for their structural versatility and multifunctionality, are ideal candidates for these magnetoelectric coupling applications. However, organic room‐temperature magnetic semiconductor cocrystals have rarely been reported, and their mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the complexity of cocrystal structures. Here, doping organic cocrystals with radicals offers a promising strategy for boosting their magnetism and conductivity while maintaining their cocrystal structures. The fluoranthene‐7,7,8,8‐tetracyanoquinodimethane radical (FA‐HTCNQ•) is constructed through a simple, rapid, and eco‐friendly solution‐processing approach. The conductive FA‐HTCNQ• exhibits excellent room‐temperature ferromagnetism with the coercive fields of 96 Oe and the Curie temperature near 400 K, superior to its structural‐identical undoped counterpart. Meanwhile, the room‐temperature magnetoelectric coupling is demonstrated in the conductive FA‐HTCNQ•. The stronger ferromagnetism and conductivity in organic cocrystals are attributed to the enhanced charge‐transfer (CT) interactions induced by radicals, rather than the spin exchange interactions between these radicals alone. The research manifests the origin of ferromagnetism in organic cocrystals and provides a simple strategy to fabricate pure organic room‐temperature magnetic semiconductor materials for future integrated magnetoelectric devices.

<title>Improving the Scintillation Performance of PEA2PbBr4 Through Zn2+ and Sb3+ Interstitial Doping Strategy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
PEA2PbBr4 is a promising scintillator for γ‐rays and nf detection. However, its energy resolution in γ‐rays detection is poor and the ability to discriminate nf/γ‐rays has not been accurately reported. It is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping enhances light yield and optimizes luminescence. Improved scintillator achieves 4.84% and 5.65% energy resolution at 662 keV and effective discrimination in γ‐rays/nf detection.








Abstract
Organic‐inorganic halide 2D perovskite single crystals have recently emerged as promising scintillators for gamma (γ) rays and fast neutrons (nf) detection. However, their energy resolution in γ‐rays detection still significantly lags behind that of perovskite semiconductor detectors. Improving crystal defects and enhancing light yield to optimize light output detected by the photomultiplier tube are crucial strategies for addressing this issue. Herein, it is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ cation interstitial doping strategy can effectively reduce internal defects within the phenylethylammonium lead bromide (PEA2PbBr4) crystal by regulating lattice expansion. This approach also suppresses light loss caused by exciton‐exciton annihilation and accelerates electron‐hole recombination processes, optimizing both the luminescence intensity and decay lifetime of the scintillator. The Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping PEA2PbBr4 scintillator achieve an optimal energy resolution of 4.84% and 5.65% at 662 keV for the photopeak, respectively. Additionally, in the 241Am‐Be field, effective identification of nf and γ‐rays around 1100 keVee is achieved using a pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method, with the figure of merit (FOM) being 0.85 and 1.03, respectively. This work provides a reliable new approach for optimizing the scintillation performance of 2D perovskite and promotes the application of 2D perovskite scintillator in γ‐rays and nf detection.

<title>Giant Modulation of Magnetoresistance in a Van Der Waals Magnet by In‐Plane Current Injection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study reveals the transition of magnetic interlayer coupling in a van der Waals (vdW) magnet driven by an in‐plane electrical bias, leading to a significant modulation of magnetoresistance. This finding introduces a novel approach to controlling magnetization through electrical bias for spintronic applications with vdW magnets.









Abstract
Efficient magnetization control is a central issue in magnetism and spintronics. Particularly, there are increasing demands for manipulation of magnetic states in van der Waals (vdW) magnets with unconventional functionalities. However, the electrically induced phase transition between ferromagnetic‐to‐antiferromagnetic states without external magnetic field is yet to be demonstrated. Here, the current‐induced magnetic phase transition in a vdW ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 is reported. Based on magneto‐transport measurements and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that transition in the interlayer magnetic coupling occurs through vertical voltage drop between layers induced by current which is attributed to high anisotropy of the resistivity caused by the vdW gaps. Such magnetic phase transition results in giant modulation of the longitudinal magnetoresistance from 5% to 170%. The electrical tunability of the magnetic phase in Fe5GeTe2 with current‐in‐plane geometry opens a path for electric control of magnetic properties, expanding the ability to use vdW magnets for spintronic applications.

<title>Building a Highly Stable Red/Near Infrared Afterglow Library with Highly Branched Structures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An efficient approach is presented for achieving a stable red/NIR afterglow with high brightness and durability at high temperatures from branched luminogens. The advantages and universality of branched luminogen@red/near‐infrared dye systems are demonstrated by varying the topological structures of the lumonigens using different numbers of branches (two to eight branches) and cores and employing dyes of different sizes.








Abstract
Achieving organic red/near infrared (NIR) phosphorescence at high temperatures is theoretically challenging because of the severe nonradiative transitions of excited triplet states with low energy gaps. This study realizes bright and persistent red/NIR afterglow with excellent high‐temperature resistance up to 413 K via highly efficient (≈100%) phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) from rationally designed branched phosphorescence luminogens as energy donors to red/NIR dyes as acceptors, coupled with optimized aggregated structures. According to systematic investigations, the abundant internal cavities formed by the highly branched luminogens in solid states ensure dye loading and space limitation, which can considerably suppress nonradiative transitions at high temperatures, promoting a persistent red/NIR afterglow with excellent stability. Moreover, 16 types of host–guest systems with varied topological structures of branched luminogens and different red/NIR dyes of various sizes confirm the universality of the strategy. This study provides an efficient approach to achieve a highly stable red/NIR afterglow.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are rapidly advancing to confront energy and environmental challenges, but the safety of SIBs has not received enough attention. The kinetic triplet model is constructed based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations to unveil a thermal decomposition kinetic mechanism of the P2‐type layered transition metal oxides before and after doping.








Abstract
The safety of the P2‐type layered transition metal oxides (P2‐NaxTMO2), a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), is a prerequisite for grid‐scale energy storage systems. However, previous thermal runaway studies mainly focused on morphological changes resulting from gas production detection and thermogravimetric analysis, while the structural transition and chemical reactions underlying these processes are still unclear. Herein, a comprehensive methodology to unveil an interplay mechanism among phase structures, interfacial microcrack, and thermal stability of the charged P2‐Na0.8Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) and the P2‐Na0.8Ni0.21Li0.12Mn0.67O2 (NNMO‐Li) at elevated temperatures is established. Combining a series of crystallographic and thermodynamic characterization techniques, the specific chemical reactions occurring in the NNMO materials during thermal runaway are clarified first and solidly proved that Li doping effectively hinders the dissolution of transition metal ions, reduces oxygen release, and enhances thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Importantly, based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations, the kinetic triplet model is successfully constructed to in‐depth elucidate the thermal decomposition reaction mechanism of P2‐NaxTMO2, demonstrating that such thermodynamic assessment provides a new perspective for building high‐safety SIBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A close‐to‐equilibrium crystallization method that enables the growth of large, high‐quality single crystals is proposed. This approach uses independent units for solute supply, crystal growth, and solute recycling, ensuring the system operates at an optimized, steady‐state growth point within the solubility phase diagram, maintaining consistent crystal growth even with varying perovskite growth window widths.









Abstract
The growth of large semiconductor crystals is crucial for advancing modern electronics and optoelectronics. While various crystal growth techniques have been developed for lead halide perovskites, a significant challenge remains: as crystal size increases, performance tends to deteriorate dramatically. This study addresses the inherent limitations of perovskite crystal growth by designing a novel strategy for near‐equilibrium growth system to maintain optimal conditions throughout the process. The system consists of three independent units: a solution supply unit, a crystal growth unit, and a solution recycling unit, which together ensure a constant solution concentration and temperature. By systematically optimizing temperature control and solution feeding rates, large and high‐quality FAPbBr3 single crystals, including a notable crystal measuring 51 × 45 × 10 mm3 are successfully produced. This crystal demonstrates a mobility‐lifetime product of 2.83 × 10⁻2 cm2 V⁻¹ and an ultralow detection limit of 319.22 pGyair, significantly surpassing existing perovskite crystals of similar size. The approach can serve as a universal platform for the controlled synthesis of all kinds of perovskite single crystals, laying the foundations for their use in various optoelectronic applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
NaGdF4@PDA‐ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) protect mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from ischemic stroke by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chelating excess Ca2+. This dual action stabilizes Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, reduces oxidative stress, and prevents ROS‐Ca2+ overload cycles, enhancing MSC survival and functionality, and ultimately improving stroke therapy outcomes.









Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. However, the survival of transplanted MSCs is often compromised by the excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions (Ca2+) in the ischemic microenvironment following blood flow occlusion. In this study, a protective strategy is developed using functional nanomaterials to escort and shield MSCs. Specifically, NaGdF4@PDA‐ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) are synthesized, featuring a NaGdF4 core coated with polydopamine (PDA) for ROS scavenging and further modified with alendronate sodium (ALD) for Ca2+ chelation. The internalization of NPANs by MSCs protected them from oxidative damage and calcium overload, thereby promoting their viability and functionality. Furthermore, NaGdF4 generated T1 signal enhancement, enabling in vivo tracking of MSCs via magnetic resonance imaging. The NPANs‐treated MSCs demonstrated improved survival and migration to the ischemic region, promoting blood flow restoration and angiogenesis. These findings confirm the feasibility of employing functional nanoparticles to augment MSCs‐based therapies, offering a promising strategy to improve their therapeutic efficacy in ischemic stroke treatment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bioinspired by naturally oriented structures of biological tissues, it developed super‐robust conductive hydrogels with highly tunable mechanical property and anisotropic structure, and demonstrated, for the first time, the mechanical strength of the conductive hydrogels, used as flexible electrodes in triboelectric and piezoresistive device, affected both the accuracy and stability of machine learning‐assisted tactile perception.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels have attracted significant attention due to exceptional flexibility, electrochemical property, and biocompatibility. However, the low mechanical strength can compromise their stability under high stress, making the material susceptible to fracture in complex or harsh environments. Achieving a balance between conductivity and mechanical robustness remains a critical challenge. In this study, super‐robust conductive hydrogels were designed and developed with highly oriented structures and densified networks, by employing techniques such as stretch‐drying‐induced directional assembly, salting‐out, and ionic crosslinking. The hydrogels showed remarkable mechanical property (tensile strength: 17.13–142.1 MPa; toughness: 50 MJ m−3), high conductivity (30.1 S m−1), and reliable strain sensing performance. Additionally, it applied this hydrogel material to fabricate biomimetic electronic skin device, significantly improving signal quality and device stability. By integrating the device with 1D convolutional neural network algorithm, it further developed a real‐time material recognition system based on triboelectric and piezoresistive signal collection, achieving a classification accuracy of up to 99.79% across eight materials. This study predicted the potential of the high‐performance conductive hydrogels for various applications in flexible smart wearables, the Internet of Things, bioelectronics, and bionic robotics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new design strategy is introduced to eliminate mutual excitation in stacked scintillator detectors by rare earth ions doped quantum‐cutting scintillators with a significant absorption‐emission shift as the top layer. The developed detector features non‐overlapping optical absorption and RL emission spectra, improving the discrimination of materials with similar densities.








Abstract
Traditional energy‐integration X‐ray imaging systems rely on total X‐ray intensity for image contrast, ignoring energy‐specific information. Recently developed multilayer stacked scintillators have enabled multispectral, large‐area flat‐panel X‐ray imaging (FPXI), enhancing material discrimination capabilities. However, increased layering can lead to mutual excitation, which may affect the accurate discrimination of X‐ray energy. This issue is tackled by proposing a novel design strategy utilizing rare earth ions doped quantum‐cutting scintillators as the top layer. These scintillators create new luminescence centers via energy transfer, resulting in a significantly larger absorption‐emission shift, as well as the potential to double the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and enhance light output. To verify this concept, a three‐layer stacked scintillator detector is developed using ytterbium ions (Yb3+)‐doped CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) as the top layer, which offers a high PLQY of over 100% and a significant absorption‐emission shift of 570 nm. This configuration, CsAgCl2 and Cs3Cu2I5 as the middle and bottom layers, respectively, ensures non‐overlapping optical absorption and radioluminescence (RL) emission spectra. By calculating the optimal thickness for each layer to absorb specific X‐ray energies, the detector demonstrates distinct absorption differences across various energy bands, enhancing the identification of materials with similar densities.

Cycloolefin copolymers bearing hydroxyl, ester, and adamantanyl side groups are synthesized. Upon dispersing various phosphors into this polymer matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full‐color room temperature phosphorescence with lifetimes of 249–590 ms, showing no obvious luminescence quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments.








Abstract
Polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have been well developed and utilized in various fields. However, their fast thermo‐ and moisture‐quenching behavior highly limit their applications in certain harsh environments. Therefore, the preparation of materials with thermo‐ and moisture‐resistant phosphorescence is greatly attractive. Compared with common water‐soluble polymers, cycloolefin copolymers (COC) show outstanding hydrophobicity and higher rigidity, even at elevated temperatures, being as a promising candidate to prepare phosphorescence materials with suppressed thermo‐ and moisture‐quenching behavior. Herein, a type of COC bearing hydroxyl, ester, and adamantanyl side groups is synthesized. After dispersing various phosphors into this matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full‐color RTP with lifetimes of 249–590 ms. Their luminescence does not show obvious quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments. In the presence of both rigid COC matrix and rigid phosphors, the corresponding composite displays high‐temperature phosphorescence performance. Even at 378 K, the composite can emit phosphorescence with a lifetime of 40–98 ms. The applications of these COC‐based composites for imaging, information encryption, and anti‐counterfeiting are thus explored.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A single‐peak stretchable BPLC laser is fabricated based on partially and fully crosslinked networks due to the slow variation of lattice orientation under small strains. The laser exhibits a tuning range of 44.429 nm at 32% strain, providing stable output over a broad‐ temperature range with 3D circularly polarized emission under small strains, presenting the potential applications in 3D mechanical perception.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers exhibit exceptional optical quality and tunability to external stimuli, holding significant promise for innovative developments in the field of flexible optoelectronics. However, there remain challenges for BPLC elastomer (BPLCE) lasers in maintaining good optical stability during stretching and varying temperature conditions. In this work, a stretchable laser is developed based on a well‐designed BPLCE with a combination of partially and fully crosslinked networks, which can output a single‐peak laser under small deformation (44.429 nm lasing shift at 32% strain) and a broad‐temperature range (from −20 to 100 °C). The superior performance can be attributed to the nonlinear 3D asymmetric deformation exhibited by the BPI lattice during stretching, particularly at low deformation rates below 40% strain, which effectively maintains the stability of the body‐centered cubic structure (with the maximum strain of this BPLCE up to 220%). Moreover, the BPLCE exhibits excellent thermal stability over a temperature range from −180 to 70 °C with a stopband shift of less than ±10 nm. As a proof‐of‐concept, the application of BPLCE laser for morphology sensing and 3D mechanical perception is demonstrated, which paves the way for potential applications of flexible optoelectronics.

<title>Coaxial Direct Ink Writing of Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers in 3D Architectures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A low‐viscosity cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) ink and a silicone ink are prepared for coaxial direct ink writing of 3D strain sensors. The silicone shell supports the CLC core to enable layer‐by‐layer printing in addition to enhancing the mechanical properties of the core. Monostable and bistable thin‐shell domes are printed to demonstrate the 3D printing capabilities and mechanochromic behaviors.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) hold great promise for mechanochromic applications in anti‐counterfeiting, smart textiles, and soft robotics, thanks to the structural color and elasticity. While CLCEs are printed via direct ink writing (DIW) to fabricate free‐standing films, complex 3D structures are not fabricated due to the opposing rheological properties necessary for cholesteric alignment and multilayer stacking. Here, 3D CLCE structures are realized by utilizing coaxial DIW to print a CLC ink within a silicone ink. By tailoring the ink compositions, and thus, the rheological properties, the cholesteric phase rapidly forms without an annealing step, while the silicone shell provides encapsulation and support to the CLCE core, allowing for layer‐by‐layer printing of self‐supported 3D structures. As a demonstration, free‐standing bistable thin‐shell domes are printed. Color changes due to compressive and tensile stresses can be witnessed from the top and bottom of the inverted domes, respectively. When the domes are arranged in an array and inverted, they can snap back to their base state by uniaxial stretching, thereby functioning as mechanical sensors with memory. The additive manufacturing platform enables the rapid fabrication of 3D mechanochromic sensors thereby expanding the realm of potential applications for CLCEs.

Mn/Zn co‐doping in α‐Cu₂V₂O₇ induces local structure distortions, enhancing supercapacitor performance (Specific capacitance‐1950.95 Fg⁻¹; Energy density‐97.54 Whkg⁻¹) and cycling stability. Spin‐phonon coupling and superior magnetic properties enable thermo‐magnetic applications. A prototype device powers LED bulbs, demonstrating real‐world energy storage potential. This work integrates energy storage and spintronics, offering a transformative approach for advanced multifunctional materials.








Abstract
Supercapacitors are rapidly gaining attention as next‐generation energy storage devices due to their superior power and energy densities. This study pioneers the investigation of Mn/Zn co‐doping in α‐Cu₂V₂O₇ (CVO) to enhance its performance as a supercapacitor electrode material. Structural and local Structural properties of Mn/Zn co‐doped CVO have been investigated through X‐ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X‐ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and X‐ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), revealing significant distortions that enhance supercapacitor performance. The optimized sample demonstrates a remarkable specific capacitance of 1950.95 Fg−1, energy density of 97.54 Whkg−1, and enhanced capacitive retention, attributed to the unique Cu coordination environment and improved charge transfer kinetics. Temperature‐dependent Raman spectroscopy unveils spin‐phonon coupling (SPC), particularly in VO₄ stretching modes, supported by magnetic measurements that shows a reduction in the Néel temperature and the emergence of zero field‐cooled (ZFC) exchange bias (EB). This work is the first to report the impact of local structure distortion on both supercapacitor performance and SPC in CVO, offering a novel strategy for developing high‐performance energy storage materials with spintronics potential. In addition, the assembled symmetric optimized supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 93.32 Whkg−1 and excellent cycling stability. A prototype device incorporating the optimized CVO successfully powers eight commercial LED bulbs, demonstrating its practical application potential.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The anion solvation structure is regulated by constructing a high‐salt concentration microenvironment, which maintains highly oxidation‐resistant contact ion pairs and ion aggregation. The tailored solvation structure assists in the formation of robust electrode‐electrolyte interphase, restraining the electrolyte oxidation and solvent co‐intercalation at high voltage, which promotes the rate capability and cycling stability of SDIBs over 10 000 cycles.








Abstract
Sodium‐based rechargeable batteries are some of the most promising candidates for electric energy storage with abundant sodium reserves, particularly, sodium‐based dual‐ion batteries (SDIBs) perform advantages in high work voltage (≈5.0 V), high‐power density, and potentially low cost. However, irreversible electrolyte decomposition and co‐intercalation of solvent molecules at the electrode interface under a high charge state are blocking their development. Herein, a high‐salt concentration microenvironment is created and proposed by tailoring the solvation structures of charge carriers including both cations and anions, which maintains highly oxidation‐resistant contact ion pairs and ion aggregates and provides a high ion conductivity. The tailored solvation structure makes a great contribution to protecting the graphite cathode from electrolyte oxidation, solvent co‐intercalation, and structural degradation by constructing a robust cathode‐electrolyte interphase with standout electrochemical stability. Based on this, the SDIBs achieved an excellent high‐voltage cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles and the battery showed an improved rate performance with 97.4 mAh g−1 maintained at 100 C. It is identified that regulating anion solvation structure is responsible for the stable interface chemistry and enhanced reaction kinetics, which provides deep insight into the compatibility design between the electrolyte and specialized charge storage in electrodes.

Abstract
Room‐temperature operation or high‐operation temperature (HOT) is essential for mid‐wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics devices providing low‐cost and compact systems for numerous applications. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as a rising candidate to enable photodetectors to operate at HOT or room temperature and develop the next‐generation infrared focal plane array (FPA) imagers.

As a result, the room‐temperature detectivity reaches as high as 1.26 × 1010 Jones, and the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) is as good as 25 mK up to 200 K.

This study analyzes the failure of wireless earbud batteries within their intended usage context. By examining degradations from the material to device level, it reveals that failure patterns are linked to device configuration and operating conditions. The interplay of battery materials, structural design, and microenvironmental factors like temperature gradients offer crucial insights for improving battery integration and reliability.








Abstract
Lithium‐ion batteries are indispensable power sources for a wide range of modern electronic devices. However, battery lifespan remains a critical limitation, directly affecting the sustainability and user experience. Conventional battery failure analysis in controlled lab settings may not capture the complex interactions and environmental factors encountered in real‐world, in‐device operating conditions. This study analyzes the failure of commercial wireless earbud batteries as a model system within their intended usage context. Through multiscale and multimodal characterizations, the degradations from the material level to the device level are correlated, elucidating a failure pattern that is closely tied to the specific device configuration and operating conditions. The findings indicate that the ultimate failure mode is determined by the interplay of battery materials, cell structural design, and the in‐device microenvironment, such as temperature gradients and their fluctuations. This holistic, in‐device perspective on environmental influences provides critical insights for battery integration design, enhancing the reliability of modern electronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To address the challenge of embedding multilayer graphs with minimal complexity and information loss, this study introduces a vertical m‐CBA (vm‐CBA) capable of directly mapping multilayer relationships. By accurately representing inter‐layer and intra‐layer connections in three dimensions, vm‐CBA outperforms conventional embeddings in link prediction and information scores while requiring fewer operations.








Abstract
Graph data structures effectively represent objects and their relationships, enabling the modeling of complex connections in various fields. Recent work demonstrate that metal at diagonal crossbar arrays (m‐CBA) can effectively represent planar graphs. However, they are unsuitable for representing multilayer graphs having multiple relationships across different layers. Using conventional software, embedding multilayer graphs in high‐dimensional Euclidean spaces introduces significant mathematical complexity and computational burden, often resulting in information loss. This study proposes a unique graph embedding (mapping) method utilizing a fabricated vertical m‐CBA (vm‐CBA), where a custom‐built measurement system thoroughly validated its functionality. This structure directly maps multilayer graphs into a 3D vm‐CBA, accurately representing inter‐layer and intra‐layer connections. The practical link prediction and information scores across various real‐world datasets demonstrated that vm‐CBA achieved enhanced accuracy compared to conventional embeddings, even with a significantly decreased number of operations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A class of ultrathin GdOX with a high dielectric constant and breakdown field strength is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated MoS2 transistor gated by monocrystalline dielectric exhibits an on/off current ratio exceeding 109 and a near‐Boltzmann‐limit SS, indicating their tangible applications in 2D electronics.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) dielectrics are extensively employed to enhance the performance of 2D electronic devices. However, current vdW dielectric materials still encounter challenges such as low dielectric constant (κ) and difficulties in synthesizing high‐quality single crystals. 2D rare‐earth oxyhalides (REOXs) with exceptional electrical properties present an opportunity for the exploration of novel high‐κ dielectrics. In this study, for the first time, the synthesis of a series of van der Waals layered gadolinium oxyhalides with thicknesses down to monolayer through a space‐confined vdW epitaxy approach and demonstrating their application as a single‐crystalline gate dielectric is reported. It exhibits a remarkable relative dielectric constant exceeding 17 and an impressive breakdown field strength of 13.5 MV cm−1. The 2D transistors directly gated by the REOXs layer exhibit enhanced electron mobility and a low interface trap density. An ultrahigh on/off current ratio of 109 and a near‐Boltzmann‐limit subthreshold swing is achieved. The superior dielectric properties, combined with the universality and scalability of the production method (e.g., millimeter‐scale films are achieved), demonstrate that 2D REOXs can serve as promising gate dielectrics for 2D electronics, thereby expanding the study of high‐κ vdW materials and potentially providing new opportunities for the development of low‐power electronic devices.

A scalable mechanochemical synthetic approach is reported to fabricate Type III PLs from solid precursors. Owing to the presence of multiple interfacial hydrogen and coordination bonds, these PLs not only maintain porosity and fluidity with high stability, enabling efficient CH4 purification by CO2 removal and sequestration, but also facilitate the catalytic conversion of stored CO2 into valuable products.









Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) have emerged as a promising class of flow porous materials, offering distinctive benefits for sustainable separation processes coupled with catalytic transformations in the chemical industry. Despite their potential, challenges remain in the realms of synthesis complexity, stability, and the strategic engineering of separation and catalytic sites. In this study, a scalable mechanochemical synthetic approach is reported to fabricate Type III PLs from solid precursors with high stability. In these Type III PLs, ZIF‐8 nanocrystals are dispersed in the deep eutectic solvents formed by solid hydrogen‐bond donors and acceptors. Owing to the presence of multiple interfacial hydrogen and coordination bonds, these PLs not only maintain porosity and fluidity with high stability, enabling efficient CH4 purification by CO2 removal and sequestration, but also facilitate the catalytic conversion of stored CO2 into valuable products under ambient conditions. This strategy advances the green production of stable and well‐dispersed PLs, showing the potential of PLs in the sustainable separation and catalysis coupling system in the chemical industry.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A Tg (glass transition temperature) regulation (TR) strategy is developed to effectively release residual strain in the perovskite film through adjusting the ratio of monomeric additives. The resulting film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and superior stability. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve a high efficiency of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%) and excellent stability.








Abstract
Thermally induced tensile strain that remains in perovskite films after annealing is one of the key reasons for diminishing the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a glass transition temperature (Tg) regulation (TR) strategy is developed by introducing two polymerizable monomers, 2‐(N‐3‐Sulfopropyl‐N,N‐dimethyl ammonium)ethyl methacrylate (SBMA) and 2‐Hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), into the perovskite layer. SBMA and HEA undergo in situ polymerization, which regulates the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite film. In addition, adjusting the ratio of SBMA and HEA to lower the Tg of the resulting polymer effectively releases the strain in the perovskite film. The modified film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and improved stability. As a result, the optimized PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%). Furthermore, the encapsulated device demonstrates prominent enhanced operation stability, maintaining 90.3% of its initial efficiency after 500 h of continuous sunlight exposure.

Dip coating is employed to fabricate large‐area organic solar cells. By controlling the fluid characteristics, the correlation among Van der Waals forces in precursor film, aggregation state of polymer, and fibrous orientation in active layer is revealed. Consequently, the dip‐coated 1.0 cm2 rigid and 10.0 cm2 flexible cells exhibit the efficiencies of 17.9% and 13.7%, respectively.








Abstract
As a classical low‐cost technique, dip coating has not been used for printable electronics. Here, the study demonstrates large‐area organic solar cells can be made by dip coating. The correlation is revealed among Van der Waals forces in precursor film, aggregation state of polymer, and fibrous orientation in active layer; the relationship is also expounded between fluid mechanics of the confined liquid in polymer scaffold and the continuity of the acceptor phase. By controlling the fluid characteristics, the ideal nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network forms. As a result, the 1.0 cm2 rigid and 10.0 cm2 flexible cells exhibit efficiencies of 17.9% and 13.7%, respectively. Moreover, the method for predicting the optimal coating speed for the dip coating of given inks is proposed. Overall, this work not only demonstrates the superiority of dip coating for organic solar cell fabrication but also provides guidance for its application in printable electronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Antiferromagnetic dynamics in nanometer‐thick LaFeO₃ films is unveiled using time‐resolved Kerr effect, demonstrating ultra‐low damping and spin‐orbit torque manipulation. This study provides an experimental validation of theoretical predictions, offering new insights into nanoscale spintronic systems. The exceptional material quality enables precise probing of dynamics, bridging the gap between antiferromagnetic materials and practical applications in ultrafast spintronics.








Abstract
In the burgeoning field of spintronics, antiferromagnetic materials (AFMs) are attracting significant attention for their potential to enable ultra‐fast, energy‐efficient devices. Thin films of AFMs are particularly promising for practical applications due to their compatibility with spin‐orbit torque (SOT) mechanisms. However, studying these thin films presents challenges, primarily due to the weak signals they produce and the rapid dynamics driven by SOT, that are too fast for conventional electric transport or microwave techniques to capture. The time‐resolved magneto‐optical Kerr effect (TR‐MOKE) has been a successful tool for probing antiferromagnetic dynamics in bulk materials, thanks to its sub‐picosecond (sub‐ps) time resolution. Yet, its application to nanometer‐scale thin films has been limited by the difficulty of detecting weak signals in such small volumes. In this study, the first successful observation of antiferromagnetic dynamics are presented in nanometer‐thick orthoferrite films using the pump‐probe technique to detect TR‐MOKE signal. This paper report an exceptionally low damping constant of 1.5 × 10−4 and confirms the AFM magnonic nature of these dynamics through angular‐dependent measurements. Furthermore, it is observed that electrical currents can potentially modulate these dynamics via SOT. The findings lay the groundwork for developing tunable, energy‐efficient spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in next‐generation spintronic applications.

<title>Dimensional Regulation of Organic n‐Type Dopants for Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202417251?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dimensional regulation strategy of organic dopants is developed to fabricate high‐performance inverted perovskite solar cells. Selenium has a strong electron‐donating ability, which can transfer electrons to perovskites. Specially, 2D‐perylene diimide can coat the perovskite crystal to form a lattice cage through their conjugate skeletons, which passivates the trap states, improves the n‐doping efficiency, and restrains ion migration.








Abstract
A strong n‐type perovskite layer is crucial in achieving high open‐circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the p‐i‐n solar cells, as the weak n‐type perovskites result in a loss of VOC, and the p‐type perovskites contain numerous electron traps that cause the severe carrier recombination. Here, three types of perylene diimide (PDI) based small molecule dopants with different dimensions, including 1D‐PDI, 2D‐PDI, and 3D‐PDI are designed, to produce heavier n‐type perovskites. The PDI‐based molecules with Selenium atoms have a strong electron‐donating ability, effectively enlarging the quasi‐Fermi level splitting within the perovskites. Besides, the PDI molecules can coat the surface of the perovskite crystal to form the lattice cage through their conjugate skeletons, which passivates the trap states and improves the n‐doping efficiency, as well as the stabilities of perovskites and related devices. With the addition of the 2D‐PDI, the small‐area solar cells achieved a PCE of 26.06% (25.44% certified) with a high VOC of 1.18 V and a remarkable fill factor of 87.23%. Furthermore, the rigid and flexible perovskite solar modules yielded high PCEs of 21.48% and 20.71%, respectively. This dimensional regulation strategy provides useful guidance for effective n‐type doping and high‐performance p‐i‐n solar cells.

<title>High Entropy Fine‐Tuning Achieves Fast Li+ Kinetics in High‐Performance Co‐Free High‐Ni Layered Cathodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work provides an efficient and versatile high‐entropy doping strategy. The synergistic effect between high‐entropy dopant elements is optimized by compositional fine‐tuning to overcome the kinetic hysteresis and high reactivity problems that have hindered the development of Co‐free Ni‐rich cathode materials. Excellent long‐cycle stability under fast charging and discharging conditions is achieved.








Abstract
Co‐free high‐Ni layered cathode materials LiNixMeyO2 (Me = Mn, Mg, Al, etc.) are a key part of the next‐generation high‐energy lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity and low cost. However, the hindered Li+ kinetics and the high reactivity of Ni4+ result in poor rate performance and unsatisfied cycling stability. This work designs a promising strategy for designing a high‐performance high‐entropy doping Co‐free high‐Ni layered cathode LiNi0.9Mn0.03Mg0.02Ta0.02Mo0.02Na0.01O2 (HE‐Ni90‐1.557) by elemental screening and compositional fine‐tuning. Compositional fine‐tuning optimizes the synergistic relationship between the high‐entropy dopant elements, thereby significantly suppresses the kinetic hysteresis induced by Li+/Ni2+ mixing. The pillar effect significantly enhances the diffusion kinetics of Li+ at the high state of charge (SOC). Meanwhile, the high‐entropy fine‐tuning significantly postpones the H2‐H3 phase transition and reduces the dissolution of transition metals and the loss of lattice oxygen in the cathodes. Consequently, the diffusion kinetics of Li+ at the atomic and electrode particle scales are significantly enhanced. The HE‐Ni90‐1.557 cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 225.1 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a full cell with a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 1500 cycles at 3C. This work provides a promising avenue for commercializing Co‐free high‐Ni cathodes for next‐generation LIBs.

A spherical core‐shell nanomotor consisting of a polydopamine‐indocyanine green composite shell and a rigid functional core is proposed in this work. This motor can be activated by the NIR‐I irradiation to perform NIR‐II imaging‐directed thermoplastic propulsion in subcutaneous tissue, enabling an efficient peritumoral administration for low‐risk superficial tumor photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Peritumoral subcutaneous injection has been highly envisioned as an efficient yet low‐risk administration of photothermal agents for superficial tumor photothermal therapy. However, obstructed by complex subcutaneous tissue, the delivery of injected photothermal agents to the specific tumor remains a critical issue. Herein, the study reports a polydopamine (PDA)‐encapsulated spherical core/shell nanomotor with fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) immobilized on its PDA shell. Upon the first near‐infrared (NIR‐I) irradiation, this motor can generate favorable photothermal heat, and meantime, emit a robust ICG fluorescence in the second near‐infrared window (NIR‐II). The heat turns the motor into an active photothermal agent able to perform thermophoretic propulsion along the irradiation direction in subcutaneous tissue, while the ICG fluorescence can direct the subcutaneous propulsion of motors toward specific tumor through real‐time NIR‐II imaging. These functions endow the motor with the ability of moving to tumor after being injected at peritumoral site, enabling an enhanced photothermal therapy (PTT). The results demonstrated herein suggest an integrated nanorobotic tool for the superficial PTT using peritumoral administration, highlighting an NIR‐II imaging‐directed subcutaneous propulsion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high‐performance Pt/CuO@CF catalyst is designed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass‐derived HMF at high concentrations with excellent recyclability. Experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that Pt modification enhances interfacial active sites, strengthens Pt‐CuO coupling, induces charge redistribution, and adjusts the d‐band structure. These changes effectively improve the adsorption of reactants and hydroxyl groups, contributing to the highly efficient HMFOR.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidation of biomass‐derived 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an environmentally friendly route for producing the sustainable polymer monomer 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Thus, precisely adjusting the synergistic adsorption among key reactive species, such as HMF and OHads, on the carefully designed catalyst surface is essential for achieving satisfactory catalytic performance for HMF oxidation to FDCA as it is closely related to the adsorption strength and configuration of the reaction substrates. This kind of regulation will ultimately facilitate the improvement of HMF oxidation performance. In this work, Pt nanoparticles modified CuO nanowires (denoted as Pt/CuO@CF) are constructed for the selective electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA under alkaline conditions. The well‐designed Pt/CuO@CF demonstrates highly impressive catalytic performance across a range of HMF concentrations, ranging from the commonly used concentrations to higher levels typically not explored (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mm) with high FEFDCA (all above 95%) and outstanding long‐term stability (15 cycles). In situ experimental characterizations confirm that the designed heterogeneous interface between Pt and CuO enhances the enrichment of HMF and OHads species on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations reveal the anchored Pt nanoparticles reduce the adsorption barrier for HMF and OHads, thereby promoting the highly selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA.

<title>Angstrom Confinement‐Triggered Adaptive Spin State Transition of CoMn Dual Single Atoms for Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Angstrom‐confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) CoMn dual single atoms within the carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate for water purification. The angstrom‐confined strategy leads to the adaptive change of atomic spin state, and reduces the energy barrier for *SO5 formation and *O2 desorption during singlet oxygen generation, enabling a 38.6‐fold increase in singlet oxygen production compared to the surface unconfined one.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in the transformation from peroxymonosulfate to singlet oxygen, adaptive tuning of atomic spin state as the peroxymonosulfate structure varied is crucial. The angstrom confinement can effectively tune spin state, but developing an adaptive angstrom‐confined atomic system is challenging. Angstrom‐confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) dual single atoms within flexible 2D carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to drive adaptive tuning of spin state by changing atomic coordination under angstrom confinement. The in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations showed that medium‐spin Co in Co─N4 absorbed electrons after the adsorption of peroxymonosulfate on CoMn dual single‐atom sites and then cleaved O─H of peroxymonosulfate to facilitate *SO5 generation, while the introduction of *SO5 increased interlayer distance and then cleaved Co─N and Mn─N, resulting in the spin state transition from medium to high. Subsequently, the high‐spin Co and Mn in Co─N2 and Mn─N2 desorbed the *O2 from *SO5, restoring the initial medium spin state. The adaptive spin state transition enhanced 38.6‐fold singlet oxygen yield compared to the unconfined control. The proposed angstrom‐confined diatomic strategy is applicable to serial diatomic catalysts, providing an efficient and universal design scheme for singlet oxygen‐mediated selective wastewater treatment technology at the atomic level.

<title>Stepwise Coordination Engineering of Pt1/Au25 Dual Catalytic Sites with Enhanced Electrochemical Activity and Stability</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The challenges of constructing heterogeneous catalysts with high metal loading, precise structures, and stability are overcome by proposing a stepwise targeted coordination engineering strategy. This approach allows for the co‐anchoring of Pt single atoms and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters on g‐C3N4 and the resulting dual‐site catalysts demonstrate remarkable electrochemical reduction capabilities and enhanced stability throughout the catalytic process.








Abstract
Dual‐site catalysts hold significant promise for accelerating complex electrochemical reactions, but a major challenge remains in balancing high loading with precise dual‐site architecture to achieve optimal activity, stability, and specificity simultaneously. Herein, a strategy of stepwise targeted coordination engineering is introduced to co‐anchor Pt single atoms (Pt1, 1.41 wt.%) and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters (Au25, 18.92 wt.%) with high loadings on graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4). This approach ensures that Pt1 and Au25 occupy distinct surface sites on the g‐C3N4 substrate, providing excellent stability and unprecedented electrochemical activity. In the catalysis of As(III), a sensitivity of 8.32 µA ppb−1 is achieved, more than double the previously reported values under neutral conditions. The enhanced detection limit (0.2 ppb) is crucial for monitoring water quality and protecting public health from arsenic contamination, a significant environmental and health risk. Furthermore, the formation of Pt─As and As─S bonds facilitates the easier breakage of As─O bonds, thereby lowering the reaction barrier energy of the rate‐determining step and significantly enhancing arsenious acid catalysis efficiency. These results not only offer an intriguing strategy for constructing highly efficient heterogeneous dual‐site catalysts but also reveal the atomic‐scale catalytic mechanisms that drive enhanced catalytic efficiency.

<title>ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb): New Mn‐Based 2D Magnetoplumbites with Geometric and Magnetic Frustration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The first Mn‐based magnetoplumbites, ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb), are discovered, synthesized, and characterized. According to magnetic properties measurements, neutron diffraction, and reverse Monte Carlo refinement, short‐range magnetic correlations are observed in the new materials. These observations reveal 2D magnetic correlations and magnetic frustration in ASb3Mn9O19, making it a promising platform for inducing exotic quantum states.








Abstract
Magnetoplumbites are one of the most broadly studied families of hexagonal ferrites, typically with high magnetic ordering temperatures, making them excellent candidates for permanent magnets. However, magnetic frustration is rarely observed in magnetoplumbites. Herein, the discovery, synthesis, and characterization of the first Mn‐based magnetoplumbite, as well as the first magnetoplumbite involving pnictogens (Sb), ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb) are reported. The Mn3+ (S = 2) cations, further confirmed by DC magnetic susceptibility and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, construct three geometrically frustrated sublattices, including Kagome, triangular, and puckered honeycomb lattices. Magnetic properties measurements revealed strong antiferromagnetic spin–spin coupling as well as multiple low‐temperature magnetic features. Heat capacity data does not show any prominent λ‐anomaly, suggesting minimal associated magnetic entropy. Moreover, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) implied the absence of long‐range magnetic ordering in KSb3Mn9O19 down to 3 K. However, several magnetic peaks are observed in RbSb3Mn9O19 at 3 K, corresponding to an incommensurate magnetic structure. Interestingly, strong diffuse scattering is seen in the NPD patterns of both compounds at low angles and is analyzed by reverse Monte Carlo refinements, indicating short‐range spin ordering related to frustrated magnetism as well as 2D magnetic correlations in ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb).

<title>A Bifunctional Lysosome‐Targeting Chimera Nanoplatform for Tumor‐Selective Protein Degradation and Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A bifunctional lysosome‐targeting chimera nanoplatform (NLTC) is synthesized for tumor‐selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling surface properties and encapsulating catalase, NLTC can efficiently accumulate at tumor tissues and avoid on‐target off‐tumor toxicity, synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) and relieve immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Lysosome‐targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for degrading extracellular and membrane‐associated pathogenic proteins by hijacking lysosome‐targeting receptors. However, the antitumor performance of LYTAC is limited by its insufficient tumor accumulation and nonspecific activation. Additionally, the synergistic effects of LYTACs and other therapeutic modalities are crucial. To address these issues, a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform (NLTC) is developed for tumor‐selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling the surface composition, the NLTC can effectively transport extracellular or membrane proteins into lysosomes for degradation via cation‐independent mannose 6‐phosphate receptors. With removable surface modification, an NLTC is obtained that efficiently accumulated in tumor tissues and avoided on‐target off‐tumor toxicity. Moreover, the synthesis method of NLTC is generally applicable to various enzymes. Thus, catalase (CAT) is encapsulated with NLTC to synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1), relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy, and significantly inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis in B16F10‐bearing mice. This work presents a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform that can not only perform tissue‐selective protein degradation but also integrate other therapeutic modalities, providing insights into the design of advanced LYTAC technologies for clinical applications.

<title>Superstrong Lightweight Aerogel with Supercontinuous Layer by Surface Reaction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A ZrO2‐SiO2 fiber aerogel with a supercontinuous nanolayer is developed for high‐temperature thermal insulation. The supercontinuous arrangement of ultra‐fine ZrO2 grains on the aerogel surface enables close connections between grains and fibers, promoting efficient transmission of mechanical and thermal stresses, which contributes to record‐high specific strength and remarkable thermal‐insulating behaviors.








Abstract
Breaking the thermal, mechanical and lightweight performance limit of aerogels has pivotal significance on thermal protection, new energy utilization, high‐temperature catalysis, structural engineering, and physics, but is severely limited by the serious discrete characteristics between grain boundary and nano‐units interfaces. Herein, a thermodynamically driven surface reaction and confined crystallization process is reported to synthesize a centimeter‐scale supercontinuous ZrO2 nanolayer on ZrO2‐SiO2 fiber aerogel surface, which significantly improved its thermal and mechanical properties with density almost unchanged (≈26 mg cm−3). Systematic structure analysis confirms that the supercontinuous layer achieves a close connection between grains and fibers through Zr─O─Si bonds. The as‐prepared aerogel exhibits record‐breaking specific strength (≈84615 N m kg−1, can support up to ≈227 272 times aerogel mass) and dynamic impact resistance (withstanding impacts up to 500 times aerogel mass and up to 200 cycling stability at 80% strain). Besides, its temperature resistance has also been greatly optimized (400 °C enhancement, stability at 1500 °C). This work will provide a new perspective for exploring the limits of lightweight, high strength, and thermal properties of solid materials.

A particle‐polymer coalescence strategy is proposed to build balanced particle cohesion, successfully realizing the bending, knotting, coiling, winding, and interlacing of cement slurry for weaving. Beyond the state‐of‐the‐art formwork casting, grouting, and 3D‐printing, this cement weaving technology may invoke the construction technology revolution and new material and structure design.








Abstract
Weaving, a pivotal technique in human construction activities since the Neolithic era, remains unattainable in modern concrete construction. Here, a novel particle‐polymer coalescence strategy is proposed, which involves electrostatic, bridging, coordinating, and hydrogen bonding interactions, to establish balanced particle cohesion, enabling the fabrication of stretchable cement slurry. The bending, knotting, coiling, winding, and interlacing of cement filaments for structural textiles is successfully realized beyond traditional formwork casting, grouting, and 3D‐printing, and fabricate the first‐ever Chinese knot woven with cement. Weaving construction builds a triaxially cross‐penetrating structure that greatly promotes interlayer strength and toughness by ≈208.5% and 676.5% compared to the state‐of‐the‐art layer‐by‐layer 3D printed structure. These findings not only make a breakthrough in concrete construction technology but also provide solutions for fabricating multi‐directional woven structures with great engineering‐application potentials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A liposome‐based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes and carbon nanotubes are embedded in the artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular probe transduction and mass transfer. The strategy accelerates cell‐cell signal probe transmission and enables effective sensing of let‐7a and visualizing let‐7a in living colon cancer cells.








Abstract
Monitoring intracellular biomarkers is crucial for clinical disease diagnosis. However, the majority of signaling molecules face difficulties in slow transference across the cell membrane to reach intracellular detection sites, limiting their application in clinical settings. This study proposes an artificial cell‐based signal probe transfer‐enhanced sensing strategy to effectively detect microRNAs (miRNAs) by embedding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in artificial cell membranes. The liposome‐based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes such as nucleic acids, metal ions, and fluorescent dyes. CNTs are embedded in artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular signal probe transduction and mass transfer. Through CNTs‐mediate cell‐cell signal probe transmission, the probes pass through the liposome membrane interface and fuse into target cells, selectively hybridizing with the intracellular target miRNAs, triggering a sensing process and resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to prove the enhancement of CNTs‐mediated cell‐cell fusion. This strategy demonstrates excellent analytical performance by quantitatively detecting let‐7a miRNA and visualizing it in living colon cancer cells. These findings hold great significance in promoting and accelerating cell‐cell signal probe transmission and enabling effective sensing of intracellular biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.

This study presents the first synthesis of 2D hexagonal Eu₂SO₂ and tetragonal Eu₂SO₆ with tunable dielectric properties. Eu₂SO₂ offers high dielectric performance, while Eu₂SO₆ provides a wider bandgap. Integrated into MoS₂ field‐effect transistors, these materials demonstrate excellent performance, highlighting their potential as multifunctional dielectrics for next‐generation low‐power electronics.








Abstract
Advancing next‐generation electronics necessitates precise control of dielectric properties in 2D materials. Here, the first synthesis of novel 2D quasi‐van der Waals (vdW) europium oxysulfur (Eu2SOx) compounds, comprising hexagonal Eu₂SO₂ and tetragonal Eu₂SO₆ phases, with composition‐tunable dielectric properties, is presented. Using a homodiffusive‐controlled epitaxial growth method, materials are achieved with complementary characteristics: the hexagonal Eu₂SO₂ phase exhibits a high dielectric constant (≈30) paired with a moderate bandgap (≈4.56 eV), while the tetragonal Eu₂SO₆ phase offers a wider bandgap (≈5.62 eV) but a lower dielectric constant (≈20). The potential of these materials is demonstrated by integrating ultrathin Eu₂SO₂ nanoplates with molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) field‐effect transistors (FETs) via vdW forces. The resulting devices achieve a near‐ideal Ion/Ioff ratio (≈10⁸), minimal hysteresis (≈5.3 mV), a low subthreshold slope (≈63.5 mV dec⁻¹), and ultralow leakage current (≈10⁻¹⁴ A). These results highlight the capacity of europium oxysulfur compounds to address the trade‐off between dielectric constant and bandgap, offering tailored solutions for diverse 2D electronic applications. This work underscores the potential of composition engineering to expand the family of rare‐earth oxysulfur compounds for nanoelectronics, paving the way for innovative gate dielectrics in next‐generation devices.

<title>Nonlinear Ion Dynamics Enable Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity of Electrochemical Ionic Synapses</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nonlinear ion dynamics in electrochemical ionic synapses enable spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP) with low energy consumption and minimal variability. The approach supports diverse STDP forms and flexible learning rules across timescales from milliseconds to nanoseconds, enabling spiking neural network hardware with high throughput and adaptability while maintaining low energy consumption and high reliability.








Abstract
Programmable synaptic devices that can achieve timing‐dependent weight updates are key components to implementing energy‐efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs). Electrochemical ionic synapses (EIS) enable the programming of weight updates with very low energy consumption and low variability. Here, the strongly nonlinear kinetics of EIS, arising from nonlinear dynamics of ions and charge transfer reactions in solids, are leveraged to implement various forms of spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP). In particular, protons are used as the working ion. Different forms of the STDP function are deterministically predicted and emulated by a linear superposition of appropriately designed pre‐ and post‐synaptic neuron signals. Heterogeneous STDP is also demonstrated within the array to capture different learning rules in the same system. STDP timescales are controllable, ranging from milliseconds to nanoseconds. The STDP resulting from EIS has lower variability than other hardware STDP implementations, due to the deterministic and uniform insertion of charge in the tunable channel material. The results indicate that the ion and charge transfer dynamics in EIS can enable bio‐plausible synapses for SNN hardware with high energy efficiency, reliability, and throughput.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces a continuous‐flow flame spray pyrolysis method for tuning lattice strain in high‐entropy‐oxide nanoparticles. By varying the cooling rates of quenching, tensile strain increases by 2.75%, enhancing oxygen evolution reaction performance with a 25 mV reduction in overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This approach facilitates efficient mass production and precise control of lattice strain.








Abstract
The lattice‐strain engineering of high‐entropy‐oxide nanoparticles (HEO‐NPs) is considered an effective strategy for achieving outstanding performance in various applications. However, lattice‐strain engineering independent of the composition variation still confronts significant challenges, with existing modulation techniques difficult to achieve mass production. Herein, a novel continuous‐flow synthesis strategy by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is proposed, which air varying flow rates is introduced for fast quenching to alter the cooling rate and control the lattice strain of HEO‐NPs. Experimental results demonstrate that as the flow rate of air increases from 0 L to 24 L min−1, the cooling rate has increased by more than ten times, and the tensile strain of the HEO‐NPs increases by 2.75%. Utilizing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as an indicator, it is observed that the overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is reduced by 25 mV. Importantly, this approach enables the simple and efficient regulation of lattice strain in HEO‐NPs (110 mg min−1). Thus, this study provides a new approach for both the mass production and regulation of lattice strain in HEO‐NPs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Mimicking micro‐pores structures from black butterflies, terahertz response behaviors with incidence‐angle‐insensitive and ultra‐broadband can be effectively controlled through a disordered pore‐induced structural orientation mechanism. In this research, the first investigation is presented into the regulation of terahertz response behaviors via optimized pore structure including disorder, pore parameters, and orientation, regarding as resonance sphere and waveguide system.








Abstract
The structural disorder of the black butterfly assists in capturing sunlight across a wider spectral and angular range, injecting infinite vitality for omnidirectional and stimuli‐responsive wave‐absorbing materials. Here, the disordered micro‐pores responding to terahertz (THz) waves through electromagnetic simulations, and then prepared via ice templating technology are analyzed and optimized. The customized disordered aerogel makes possible perfect terahertz response property with incidence‐angle‐insensitive and ultra‐broadband. Ti3C2Tx MXene/carboxymethyl cellulose aerogels realize excellent shielding effectiveness exceeding 70.32 dB and reflection loss of more than 43.02 dB over the frequency range of 0.3–1.5 THz. Tailoring the structural orientation of anisotropic aerogels functions as a versatile dynamic modulation approach along terahertz propagation direction. The porous structure with moderate conductivity gradually triggers the resonance effect of the cavity, approximating a resonance sphere (pore) and waveguide system (tube). Ultimately, gradient impedance aerogel is proposed integrating THz‐infrared stealth, hydrophobicity, and mechanical strength. This inspired biomimetic structural strategy will also enable various terahertz applications such as terahertz imaging, line‐of‐sight telecommunication, information encryption, and space exploration.

<title>Cation‐Vacancy Engineering in Cobalt Selenide Boosts Electrocatalytic Upcycling of Polyester Thermoplastics at Industrial‐Level Current Density</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cation vacancies‐vacancies‐rich cobalt selenide as electrocatalyst to convert polybutylene terephthalate into succinic acid is crafted, which functions well at industrial‐level current density (1.5 A cm−2 @1.477 V vs. RHE). The catalytic mechanism of catalyst and related generality of electrocatalytic upcycling of other polyester thermoplastics are investigated. This work contributes to propel current research frontier of utilization of low‐value carbon resources.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed the increasing accumulation of plastics, posing a daunting environmental crisis. Among various solutions, converting plastics into value‐added products presents a significant endeavor. Here, an electrocatalytic upcycling route that efficiently converts waste poly(butylene terephthalate) plastics into high‐value succinic acid with high Faradaic efficiency of 94.0% over cation vacancies‐rich cobalt selenide catalyst is reported, showcasing unprecedented activity (1.477 V vs. RHE) to achieve an industrial‐level current density of 1.5 A cm−2, and featuring a robust operating durability (≈170 h). In particular, when combining butane‐1,4‐diol monomer oxidation (BOR) with hydrogen evolution using the cation vacancy‐engineered cobalt selenide as bifunctional catalyst, a relatively low cell voltage of 1.681 V is required to reach 400 mA cm−2, manifesting an energy‐saving efficiency of ≈15% compared to pure water splitting. The mechanism and reaction pathways of BOR over the vacancies‐rich catalyst are first revealed through theoretical calculations and in‐situ spectroscopic investigations. The generality of this catalyst is evidenced by its powerful electrocatalytic activity to other polyester thermoplastics such as poly(butylene succinate) and poly(ethylene terephthalate). These electrocatalytic upcycling strategies can be coupled with the reduction of small molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2, and NO3−), shedding light on energy‐saving production of value‐added chemicals.

The modification of SU5402 (SU) with aliphatic chains containing 20 carbon atoms (SU‐C20 NPs) exhibits an exceptional ability to penetrate the ocular barrier and ensure prolonged drug retention within the eye. These optimized prodrug nanoparticles show a remarkable therapeutic effect in choroidal neovascularization (CNV), resulting in minimal hyperfluorescent leakage and the smallest CNV lesion thickness.








Abstract
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a prevalent cause of vision impairment. The primary treatment for CNV involves intravitreal injections of anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. Nevertheless, this approach still faces numerous limitations like poor patient compliance, high therapy expenditure and lack of response in some individuals. Herein, a series of anti‐neovascularization prodrugs, SU5402 (SU), modified with lipids of varying chain lengths (C12, C16, C20, C24, C28) is synthesized (SU‐C12, SU‐C16, SU‐C20, SU‐C24, SU‐C28). 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as a stabilizer to create nanoformulations of five prodrugs named SU‐C12 NPs, SU‐C16 NPs, SU‐C20 NPs, SU‐C24 NPs, SU‐C28 NPs. Among these, SU‐C20 NPs significantly prolong the retention of bioactive drug in the eye for up to 70 d. Moreover, SU‐C20 NPs demonstrate superior tissue permeability via enhanced cellular endocytosis and exocytosis. With its prolonged retention and improved penetration, SU‐C20 NPs reduce the fluorescence intensity of fundus leakage by 42.5% and the fluorescence area by 51.5% in CNV mice after four weeks, effectively inhibiting the progression of CNV. Altogether, small molecule drug SU is innovatively modified to improve its effectiveness for treating fundus neovascular diseases, proposing an alternative therapy for wet age‐related macular degeneration (wAMD).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Intra‐particle pores play a practical role in cutting down the electrolyte quantity needed during wetting. A high pore‐throat ratio empowers Li‐rich layered oxides to withstand lean electrolyte conditions at 1.4 g Ah−1 and achieve a specific energy of 600 Wh kg−1 in a pouch cell. This accomplishment charts a course for pore‐based regulation in high‐energy storage devices.








Abstract
Reducing excess electrolytes offers a promising approach to improve the specific energy of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, using lean electrolytes presents a significant challenge for porous electrode materials due to heterogeneous wetting. The spontaneous wetting of nano‐ or meso‐pores within particles, though seldom discussed, adversely affects wetting under lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, this undesired wetting behavior is mitigated by enlarging the pore‐throat ratio, enabling Li‐rich layered oxide to function effectively at very low electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio of 1.4 g Ah−1. The resulting pouch cell achieves 606 Wh kg−1 and retains 80% capacity (75% energy) after 70 cycles. Through imaging techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that the pore‐throat ratio effectively determines the permeability of electrolyte within particles. By elucidating pore‐relating mechanisms, this work unveils promising potential of manipulating pore structures in porous electrode materials, an approach that can be applied to improve the specific energy of other devices including semi‐solid‐state lithium batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An innovative ultralight electrospun nanofiber composite filter, mass‐produced via an one‐step free surface electrospinning technology, is engineered with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure, featuring elongated internal aperture channels. This advanced TSN filter excels in high‐performance filtration of ultrafine PM0.3 aerosols, while significantly minimizing material usage. It is designed for recyclability and operates with low energy requirements, ensuring both wearer comfort and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
Air pollutants, particularly highly permeable particulate matter (PM), threaten public health and environmental sustainability due to extensive filter media consumption. Existing melt‐blown nonwoven filters struggle with PM0.3 removal, energy consumption, and disposal burdens. Here, an ultralight composite filter with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure that saves ≈98% of raw material usage and reduces fabrication time by 99.4%, while simultaneously achieving high‐efficiency PM0.3 removal (≥99.92%), eco‐friendly regeneration (near‐zero energy consumption), and enhanced wearing comfort (breathability >80 mm s⁻¹, infrared transmittance >85%), is reported. The TSN filter consists of a hybrid layer of microspheres (average diameter ≈1 µm)/superfine nanofibers (≈20 nm) sandwiched between two nanofiber scaffolds (diameter ≈400 nm and ≈100 nm). This arrangement offers high porosity (≈85%), ultralow areal density (<1 g m−2), alow airflow resistance (<90 Pa), guaranteeing superb thermal comfort. Notably, utilizing scalable one‐step free surface electrospinning technology, TSN mats can be mass‐produced at a rate of 60 meters per hour (width of 1.6 meters), which is critical and verified for various applications including window screens, individual respiratory protectors, and dust collectors. This work provides a viable strategy for designing high‐performance nanofiber filter media through structural regulation in a scalable, cost‐effective, and sustainable way.

<title>Tailoring Buried Interface and Minimizing Energy Loss Enable Efficient Narrow and Wide Bandgap Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells by Aluminum Glycinate Based Organometallic Molecule</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Aluminum glycinate‐based organometallic molecule is used to tailor buried interface and minimize interface‐driven energy loss, which realizes high efficiencies of 26.74% and 20.71% for 1.55 and 1.785 eV bandgap perovskite solar cells, respectively.








Abstract
Rational regulation of Me‐4PACz/perovskite interface has emerged as a significant challenge in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an organometallic molecule of aluminum glycinate (AG) that contained amine (‐NH2) and aluminum hydroxyl (Al‐OH) groups is developed to tailor the buried interface and minimize interface‐driven energy losses. The Al‐OH groups selectively bonded with unanchored O═P‐OH and bare NiO‐OH to optimize the surface morphology and energy levels, while the ‐NH2 group interacted specifically with Pb2+ to retard perovskite crystallization, passivate buried Pb‐related defects, and release residual interface stress. These interactions facilitate the interface carrier extraction and reduce interface‐driven energy losses, thereby realizing a balanced charge carrier transport. Consequently, AG‐modified narrow bandgap (1.55 eV) PSC demonstrates an efficiency of 26.74% (certified 26.21%) with a fill factor of 86.65%; AG‐modified wide bandgap (1.785 eV) PSC realizes 20.71% champion efficiency with excellent repeatability. These PSCs maintain 91.37%, 91.92%, and 92.00% of their initial efficiency after aging in air atmosphere, the nitrogen‐filled atmosphere at 85 °C, and continuously tracking at the maximum power‐point under one‐sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) for 1200 h, respectively.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
3D Pillar‐layered COFs (PL‐COFs) with adjustable interlayer spacing, enhanced crystallinity, and increased porosity are designed and constructed using a pillaring strategy via metal‐ligand coordination, which demonstrates significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2‐to‐CO conversion compared to their 2D layered COF counterparts.








Abstract
Growing global concerns over energy security and climate change have intensified efforts to develop sustainable strategies for electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2RR). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for eCO2RR due to their tunable structures, high surface areas, and abundance of active sites. However, the performance of 2D COFs is often limited by layer stacking, which restricts active site exposure and reduces selectivity. To overcome these challenges, a new class of COFs known as pillar‐layered COFs (PL‐COFs) is developed featuring adjustable interlayer spacing and a 3D architecture. Characterization using PXRD, TEM, XPS, and EIS confirmed the successful integration of pillar molecules, which leads to increased interlayer spacing, crystallinity, and porosity. These structural advancements result in significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2‐to‐CO conversion. Density functional theory simulations revealed that enhanced CO2 adsorption and CO desorption contribute to the outstanding performance of PL‐COF‐1, which boasts the largest interlayer spacing. This material achieved an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 91.3% and demonstrated a significant current density, outperforming both the original COF‐366‐Co and PL‐COF‐2. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pillaring strategy in optimizing COF‐based electrocatalysts, paving the way for next‐generation materials for CO2 reduction and sustainable energy conversion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
MgTe2O5 with 0D structure has been successfully selected and grown as a waveplate crystal. The MgTe2O5 crystal shows tiny birefringence of 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5 µm with a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW cm−2. This work provides a novel waveplate crystal and excellent waveplate devices.








Abstract
Waveplates are important optical components to control the polarization of light. Currently, they are often fabricated from uniaxial crystals, and there is no report about waveplates based on the biaxial crystals. In this work, a novel biaxial crystal MgTe2O5 with a structure constructed by 0D Te2O5 groups is designed and grown as waveplate materials for the first time. The exciting result is that the birefringence in the (001)‐plane is smaller than 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5 µm, which is significantly smaller than that of the current waveplate materials. The polarization modulations of the MgTe2O5 devices working at 532 nm indicate that excellent zero‐order half and quarter waveplates have been successfully prepared. In addition, achromatic waveplates used in the visible, near‐infrared, and mid‐infrared ranges have also been calculated. The MgTe2O5 crystal not only exhibits a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW cm−2 but also shows a wide transmission range from 0.37 to 6.3 µm. These results provide an excellent waveplate crystal and explore the applications of biaxial crystals.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel Li‐rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li‐ion conduction in composite solid‐state electrolytes. Negatively charged cation defects intensify the concentration enrichment of Li ions on the nanofiller surface, inducing the formation of interconnected Li‐rich transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1 × 10⁻3 S cm⁻1 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid‐state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) have garnered considerable attention due to their potential for high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, their widespread development has been hindered by the low ionic conductivity of solid‐state electrolytes. In this contribution, a novel Li‐rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li‐ion conduction in composite solid‐state electrolytes. By incorporating cation‐deficient dielectric nanofillers into polymer matrices, it is found that negatively charged cation defects effectively intensify the adsorption of Li ions, resulting in a high Li‐ion concentration enrichment on the surface of fillers. More importantly, these formed Li‐rich layers are interconnected to establish continuous ultrafast Li‐ion transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibited a remarkably low ion transport activation energy (0.17 eV) and achieved an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1 × 10⁻3 S cm⁻1 at room temperature. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mo0.1O2 full cells demonstrated an extended cycling life of over 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 70.7%. This work provides a fresh insight into improving Li‐ion transport by constructing interconnected Li‐rich transport networks, paving the way for the development of high‐performance SSLMBs.

Synopsis: Utilizing a 2D framework matrix, a strategy is presented to balance Cr3⁺‐pair emissions at high doping concentrations while effectively suppressing undesirable quenching, thereby ensuring sustained luminescent efficiency.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable near‐infrared emitters related to Cr3+‐pairs for advanced optoelectronic devices remains a challenge due to concentration quenching effects and unclear luminescence mechanisms. In this study, Cr3+ ions are incorporated into a matrix structure consisting of ZnAl₂O₄ spinel units separated by 11.312 Å, effectively restricting energy transfer between luminescent centers and alleviating quenching effects. Computational analysis identifies the lattice positions of isolated Cr3+ ions and Cr3+‐pairs at different doping levels, providing insights into their spatial distribution and local structural environments. Photoluminescence measurements reveals a Cr3+‐concentration‐dependent emission broadening, with a Cr3+‐pair emission band peak at 750 nm, while detailed spectral analysis further clarified the energy level structure of Cr3+‐pairs for the first time. Enhanced material performance is achieved through flux‐assisted synthesis, reaching a high external quantum efficiency of 58.3%. Consequently, the assembled pc‐LEDs exhibit minimal efficiency roll‐off and achieve a high output of 183 mW at 650 mA, demonstrating their potential in near‐infrared light sources and night vision technology application.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A biomass‐derived carbon integrated with Zn single‐atom catalysts for iodine hosting is designed, integrating the high specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, and nitrogen doping of carbon, along with the excellent chemical confinement and electrocatalytic properties of Zn single atoms. This enabled Zn‐I2 batteries to achieve a long lifespan of 80 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with 93.6% capacity retention.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc iodine (Zn‐I2) batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, environmental compatibility, and high specific capacity. However, their development is hindered by the severe shuttle effect of polyiodides and the slow redox conversion kinetics of the iodine (I2) cathode. Herein, a long‐life Zn‐I2 battery is developed by anchoring iodine within an edible fungus slag‐derived carbon matrix encapsulated with Zn single‐atom catalysts (SAZn@CFS). The high N content and microporous structure of SAZn@CFS provide a strong iodine confinement, while the Zn‐N4‐C sites chemical interact with polyiodides effectively mitigating the iodine dissolution and the polyiodide shuttle effect. Additionally, the uniformly distributed SAZn sites significantly enhance the redox conversion efficiency of I−/I3−/I5−/I2, leading to improved capacity. At a high current density of 10 A g−1, the designed Zn‐I2 battery delivers an excellent capacity of 147.2 mAh g−1 and a long lifespan of over 80 000 cycles with 93.6% capacity retention. Furthermore, the battery exhibits stable operation for 3500 times even at 50 °C, demonstrating significant advances in iodine reversible storage. This synergistic strategy optimizes composite structure, offering a practical approach to meet the requirements of high‐performance Zn‐I2 batteries.

This article presents an innovative approach to developing pH‐responsive thiopyrylium‐based NIR‐II fluorophores with enhanced photoacoustic and photodynamic properties. By precisely modulating molecular aggregation, the study demonstrates significant advances in tumor‐targeted dual‐modal imaging and therapy, providing a promising pathway for future cancer diagnosis and treatment.








Abstract
Aggregation profoundly influences the photophysical properties of molecules. Here, a new series of thiopyrylium‐based hemicyanine near‐infrared II (NIR‐II) fluorophores is developed by meticulously adjusting their aggregation states. Notably, the star molecule HTPA exhibits a remarkable pH‐responsive behavior and a significant increase in photoacoustic (PA) intensity when aggregated. Additionally, their behavior and pH reversibility during aggregation formation are systematically investigated, including computational optimization, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, NMR analysis, and single crystal analysis. Finally, an innovative “off ” nanoparticle specifically is designed for effective tumor‐targeted PA/NIR‐II dual‐modal imaging and photodynamic therapy by utilizing a pH‐responsive polymer. The signal‐to‐background ratio (SBR) of PA signals significantly increased to 169 in the region of interest (ROI) in the mouse model when irradiated at 1064 nm. These findings not only provide a promising avenue for future studies of NIR‐II small molecules but also pave the way for significant advances in the field of integrated cancer diagnosis and therapy.

A high‐entropy alloy catalyst capable of stable hydrogen precipitation at current densities of −500 and −1000 mA·cm−2 is successfully developed with negligible activity loss over 100 h. This work offers new insights and approaches for designing HEAs that reliably produce hydrogen at high current densities.








Abstract
Efficient and stable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at high current densities is highly desirable for industrial‐scale hydrogen production, which is yet challenging, because of the electrocatalyst with short lifespans during the acidic HER process. Here, a controllable preparation technique is successfully developed to synthesize PdPtRuRhAu high‐entropy alloys (HEAs) of various sizes, within the 3.14 nm particles (HEA‐3.14) demonstrating exceptional catalytic performance and stable hydrogen production at current densities of −500 and −1000 mA·cm−2 with negligible activity loss over 100 h. Theoretical calculations indicate that the bridge adsorption site of Pd–Au serves as an ideal location for HER, with HEA‐3.14 possessing the highest proportion of such sites, reaching 18.97%. To further analyze the thermodynamic stability of HEAs, an element‐encoding machine learning model is developed from over 300 000 preprocessed dataset of HEAs that achieving an impressively low RMSE of 58.6 °C and a high R2 value of 0.98. By integrating thermodynamic modeling with machine learning methods, the melting point of the PdPtRuRhAu HEAs at 3.14 nm (366 °C) is predicted, which aligns well with the results obtained from differential scanning calorimetry tests. This work offers new insights and approaches for designing HEAs that reliably produce hydrogen at high current densities.

Metallic MoO3‐x is successfully prepared at the kilogram scale and exhibits an outstanding STA efficiency (≈0.3%) under simulated‐solar irradiation. Its potential scalability of the large‐scale photocatalytic system stems from a high STA efficiency (0.03%) and good stability (6 days) of the 1 m2 panel reactor system, yielding solar fertilizer ((NH4)2SO4).








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to convert molecular N2 into nitrogen‐rich chemicals (e.g., ammonia) provides a potential pathway for the manufacture of “solar fertilizers”. However, the solar‐to‐ammonia (STA) efficiency of most solar fertilizer systems developed to date is less than 0.1%. Herein, an outstanding STA efficiency of ≈0.3% using a metallic molybdenum trioxide (metallic MoO3‐x) photocatalyst under simulated‐solar irradiation is reported, with localized surface plasmon resonance phenomena in the metallic MoO3‐x photocatalyst enhancing both light utilization and N2 activation. The potential scalability of the photocatalytic technology is demonstrated in a 1 m2 panel reactor system, with a high STA efficiency and good stability demonstrated over 6 days of outdoor testing, yielding a solid (NH4)2SO4 product for easy collection. The as‐designed square‐meter outdoor reaction system facilitates the integration of solar fertilizer technology with existing agricultural infrastructure.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Industrial pillar Barium titanate‐based bulk ceramic capacitors suffer from low energy storage density, hindering their use in advanced applications. By designing a favorable local structure and optimizing chemical composition to improve local polarization and refine grain structure, energy density above 15 J cm−3 is achieved, along with superior overall performance, overcoming the current bottleneck of this capacitor type.








Abstract
Pb‐free dielectric energy storage capacitors are core components in advanced pulse‐power electronic systems and devices. However, the relatively low energy density (Wrec) for the industrial pillar BaTiO3 (BT)‐based capacitors remains a significant obstacle for their cutting‐edge applications, due to their low intrinsic polarization and breakdown strength (EB). Herein, through chemical composition and local structure design, a giant Wrec of 15.1 J cm−3 along with a high efficiency (η) of 85% is demonstrated in a BT‐based relaxor bulk ceramic. This is achieved by introducing rare A‐site polarization enhancement substitution (Bi0.5Na0.5)2+ ions in combination with B‐site fastest relaxation alternative (Zn1/3Nb2/3)4+ ions to enhance local polarization and refine grain structure. Atomic‐level local structure analysis has revealed that the diversified atomic polar displacement vectors, characterized by largely extended magnitude and heterogeneous directions, assemble into highly polarizable clusters at several unit‐cells scale. Consequently, it exerts a large polarization difference (ΔP) of 49 µC cm−2 and a high EB of 90 kV mm−1. Moreover, a giant power density (677 MW cm−3), high discharge energy density (3.9 J cm−3), and excellent stability are achieved. This study overcomes the current Wrec bottleneck of ≈10 J cm−3 in BT‐based bulk ceramics, presenting an approach to optimize the energy storage performance of Pb‐free relaxors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The Printess is a low‐cost, open‐source, multimaterial 3D printer for direct ink writing. Built for under $250, it is highly customizable and supports various advanced direct ink writing modalities, including multimaterial mixing, multimaterial multinozzle, and embedded 3D printing. The bioprinter's easy assembly, low cost, and high precision make it suitable for both research and educational settings.









Abstract
Direct ink writing is a 3D printing method that is compatible with a wide range of structural, elastomeric, electronic, and living materials, and it continues to expand its uses into physics, engineering, and biology laboratories. However, the large footprint, closed hardware and software ecosystems, and expense of commercial systems often hamper widespread adoption. This work introduces a compact, low‐cost, multimaterial, and high‐throughput direct ink writing 3D printer platform with detailed assembly files and instructions provided freely online. In contrast to existing low‐cost 3D printers and bioprinters, which typically modify off‐the‐shelf plastic 3D printers, this system is built from scratch, offering a lower cost and full customizability. Active mixing of cell‐laden bioinks, high‐throughput production of auxetic lattices using multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing methods, and a high‐toughness, photocurable hydrogel for fabrication of heart valves are introduced. Finally, hardware for embedded multinozzle and 3D gradient nozzle printing is developed for producing high‐throughput and graded 3D parts. This powerful, simple‐to‐build, and customizable printing platform can help stimulate a vibrant biomaker community of engineers, biologists, and educators.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anisotropic conducting polymer films can exhibit optical hyperbolic properties which here are found connected to large birefringence and linear dichroism. Off‐axis twist‐stacking of only two such subwavelength films can therefore enable large and broadband circular dichroism (CD), with CD bandwidth closely related to the hyperbolic bandwidth. The study demonstrates the general concept using twist‐stacked stretched PEDOT films.








Abstract
Chiral‐specific interaction of light with organic materials is important but typically arises from circular polarization‐dependent absorption of specific optical transitions, resulting in narrow effective wavelength ranges. This study presents a scalable and universal concept for broadband circular dichroism (CD) enabled by strained conducting polymer thin films that possess in‐plane hyperbolic optical behavior (i.e., optically metallic and dielectric properties along orthogonal directions). It is shown that off‐axis stacking of two or more such thin films provides broadband CD that varies with the hyperbolic bandwidth and stacking geometry. By contrast to traditional chiroptical materials, the CD can also be modulated by redox‐tuning of the hyperbolic polymer properties, opening for broadband dynamic chiroptical components.

With the benefit of the interface, the fabricated reversible adhesive electrode exhibits a high shear strength of 317 kPa at a low voltage of 4 V, and the ionic diode and transistor maintain stable semiconductor characteristics under arbitrary deformation.








Abstract
Ionic devices find applications such as flexible electronics and biomedicines and function by exploiting hybrid circuits of mobile ions and electrons. However, the poor interfacial compatibility of hard electronic conductors with soft ionic conductors in ionic devices leads to low deformability, sensitivity, electromechanical responses, and stability. Herein, an interpenetrating interface between silicone‐modified polyurethane/carbon nanotube electronic conductors and ionoelastomers in an ionic device using in situ polymerization is fabricated. A robust interpenetrating electronic/ionic conductor interface is realized through molecular chain entanglement and molecular forces (such as ion‐dipole interactions and H‐bonds), effectively enhancing the bonding strength and contact area between the components and resulting in an excellent flexibility, stability, and device performance. The electroadhesive prepared based on this strategy exhibits a superrobust shear strength of 317 kPa under a reduced voltage input of −4 V, and the diode and the transistor can undergo arbitrary deformation while maintaining the semiconductor device characteristics, including rectification and switching. In addition, electromechanical transducers exhibit sensitive electrical responses to various deformation signals. This solution to the interfacial compatibility problems of electronic and ionic conductors holds promise for the development of multifunctional ionic devices.

<title>Compression‐Durable Soft Electronic Circuits Enabled by Embedding Self‐Healing Biphasic Liquid‐Solid Metal Into Microstructured Elastomeric Channels</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A compressible, stretchable conductor combining liquid (GalnSn) and solid (BilnSn) metals is designed. The solid layer resists compression, while the liquid layer self‐heals cracks under strain. Embedded micropillars enhance durability, enabling stable conductivity under extreme pressure (38.2 MPa) and cyclic loads. This biphasic design allows high‐resolution manufacturing of robust antennas and circuits for soft electronics.








Abstract
Compression strongly degrades the electrical conductivity of the liquid‐metal‐based circuits because the liquid state is prone to be squashed. Here, a new compressible and stretchable biphasic liquid‐solid self‐healing circuit is proposed by filling GalnSn‐BilnSn biphasic metal into micropillar‐embedded channels. The underlying BilnSn solid alloy layer serves as a compression resistance layer, while the upper GalnSn liquid metal layer enables the real‐time filling of the cracks in the solid layer under large deformations, resulting in autonomous self‐healing and maintenance of conductivity under both stretching and compression. The embedded micropillars further improved the compression durability by providing additional mechanical support. The synergistic effect between the biphasic materials and embedded micropillar enables the designed stretchable conductor to show stable performance (R/R0<10) under pressure of 38.2 MPa (≈389.5 Kgf cm−2) and cyclic pressure of 15.8 MPa over 7000 cycles (R/R0<0.48%) without compromising the stretchability, whereas the liquid metal‐based conductor can only endure pressure up to 2.5 MPa (25.49 Kgf cm−2). The stretchable antenna and hybrid circuits fabricated using the designed biphasic metal conductor showed enhanced compression durability. The structure‐confined filling strategy enabled high‐resolution and scalable manufacturing. Overall, robust stability under compression significantly expands the range of possible applications of liquid‐metal‐based conductors in soft electronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An ion‐confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio‐inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio‐inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high‐performance machine vision. Herein, an ion‐confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio‐inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine‐tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio‐inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.

<title>Shape‐Controlled Reversible Li Plating‐Stripping for Stable and High‐Rate Anode‐Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A shape change‐free and lithium‐free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface‐protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life‐span anode‐free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode‐free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high‐energy‐density power sources with low‐cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change‐free and lithium‐free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating‐stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly‐ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface‐coated lithium‐phosphorus‐oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid‐electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long‐term and high‐rate cycling. The assembled half‐cell stably works at 1.2 mA cm−2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre‐deposition, full‐cells using modified‐LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150‐cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617 Wh kg−1 at 2C rate.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work demonstrates an on‐chip non‐volatile reconfigurable THz topological silicon chip that integrates a waveguide‐cavity coupled system with phase‐change material, Ge2Sb2Te5, enabling persistent and efficient functionality without constant power input. This advancement significantly paves the way for integrating phase change materials into silicon topological chips for programmable photonic devices, including interconnects, modulators, phase shifters, and logic circuits.








Abstract
Programmable on‐chip terahertz (THz) topological photonic devices are poised to address the rising need for high‐capacity data systems, offering broad bandwidth, minimal loss, and reconfigurability. However, current THz topological chips rely on volatile tuning mechanisms that require continuous power to function. Here, a nonvolatile, programmable THz topological silicon chip is demonstrated that integrates a waveguide‐cavity coupled system with phase‐change material, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), enabling persistent and efficient functionality without constant power input. Through precise tuning of the intermediate phase states of GST between amorphous and crystalline forms, a stable, non‐volatile reconfiguration of the topological cavity is achieved, enabling transitions across over‐coupling, critical coupling, and under‐coupling states. Multi‐level modulation of resonance transmission with a modulation depth of 70 dB is demonstrated, enabling precise control over the onset and disappearance of resonance modes and dynamic tuning of critical coupling states. The THz topological chip facilitates phototunable, volatile modulation across nonvolatile configurations, allowing controlled resetting of the coupling states of the cavity. Here, the first nonvolatile, programmable terahertz topological integrated chip is demonstrated, offering flexible control over resonance modes. This advancement significantly paves the way for integrating phase change materials into silicon topological chips for programmable photonic devices, including interconnects, modulators, and logic circuits.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The actuation of stomata—referring to their opening and closing—is crucial for photosynthesis because it regulates gas exchange and water balance. Here, it is investigated if this life‐like property could enhance the photocatalytic properties of soft materials. A hybrid supramolecular and covalent polymer hydrogel is developed to integrate photocatalytic chromophores and stimuli‐responsive properties for controlling or improving light‐driven superoxide or hydrogen peroxide generation.








Abstract
Mechanical expansion and contraction of pores within photosynthetic organisms regulate a series of processes that are necessary to manage light absorption, control gas exchange, and regulate water loss. These pores, known as stoma, allow the plant to maximize photosynthetic output depending on environmental conditions such as light intensity, humidity, and temperature by actively changing the size of the stomal opening. Despite advances in artificial photosynthetic systems, little is known about the effect of such mechanical actuation in synthetic materials where chemical reactions occur. It is reported here on a hybrid hydrogel that combines light‐activated supramolecular polymers for superoxide production with thermal mechanical actuation of a covalent polymer. Superoxide production is important in organic synthesis and environmental remediation, and is a potential precursor to hydrogen peroxide liquid fuel. It is shown that the closing of pores in the hybrid hydrogel results in a substantial decrease in photocatalysis, but cycles of swollen and contracted states enhance photocatalysis. The observations motivate the development of biomimetic photosynthetic materials that integrate large scale motion and chemical reactions.

A novel multifunctional fiber energy storage device consisting of LMO‐LTP‐AC is developed by the coating‐extrusion method. Due to the continuous preparation process, devices exhibited an ultra‐high production rate of 6000 km year−1. This innovative approach significantly enhanced the device performance, achieving a specific capacity of 89.4 mAh g−1 for fiber batteries and rate performance of 20 C for fiber hybrid supercapacitors.








Abstract
The rise of wearable electronics demands flexible energy storage solutions like flexible fiber energy storage devices (FESDs), known for their flexibility and portability. However, it remains difficult for existing fabrication methods (typically, finite‐coating, thermal‐drawing, and solution‐extrusion) to simultaneously achieve desirable electrochemical performances and fast production of FESDs. Here, a new scalable coating‐extrusion method is developed, utilizing a novel extruded spinneret with tapered apertures to create dual pressure zones. These attributes reduced porosity, enhanced electrode materials loading, and stabilized the interface between the fiber electrode and gel electrolyte of FESDs, enabling the integration of three functional electrodes for the fabrication of both fiber LMO‐LTP batteries and fiber LMO/LTP‐AC hybrid supercapacitor within a single energy storage device. The resultant multifunctional device achieved a high specific capacity of 89.4 mAh g−1 in battery mode and demonstrated excellent rate performance of 20 C with nearly 50% capacity retention in supercapacitor mode, with a production rate of 6000 km year−1.

<title>Negative Enthalpy Doping Stabilizes P2‐Type Oxides Cathode for High‐Performance Sodium‐Ion Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A negative enthalpy doping strategy can significantly increase its in‐plane stability of the transition metal layer, which considerably suppresses destructive P2 to O2 phase transition and reduces lattice distortion, stabilizing the cycling performance of P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode for sodium‐ion batteries.








Abstract
P2‐type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) as cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) largely suffers from continuous accumulation of local stress caused by destructive structural evolution and irreversible oxygen loss upon cycling, leading to rapid capacity degradation. Herein, a strategy of negative enthalpy doping (NED), wherein transition metal (TM) sites are substituted with 0.01 mol each Sn, Sb, Cu, Ti, Mg, and Zn to increase the stability of the TM layers, is proposed. The robust structure of NED‐NNMO significantly suppresses the P2 to O2 phase transition and improves the Na+ kinetics upon long‐term cycling. Consequently, the NED‐NNMO exhibits much smoothened voltage platforms and improved oxygen redox reversibility, thus considerably extended lifetime as compared with the pristine NNMO sample. The NED‐NNMO delivers a high capacity of 138.9 mAh g−1 with an operation voltage of 3.51 V under 0.1 C and prominent capacity retention of 94.6% after 100 cycles under 1 C, and 90.0% over 3000 cycles under ultra‐high rate of 30 C, which is among the best over previous reports. Moreover, an ampere‐hour scale pouch cell based on the NED‐NNMO demonstrates an energy density of 139 Wh kg−1. This work sheds light on a route of negative enthalpy doping to design high‐performance sodium‐ion batteries.

<title>High‐Capacity Volumetric Methane Storage in Hyper‐Cross‐Linked Porous Polymers via Flexibility Engineering of Building Units</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An unprecedented flexible porous polymer HCP‐DPP, constructed by the flexible building unit with the rigid external crosslinker, achieves a desirable trade‐off between porosity and density while displaying an unusual gate‐opening effect; which set a record‐high volumetric methane storage capacity among reported adsorbents, revealing a great promise for flexible hyper‐cross‐linked polymers in methane storage applications.








Abstract
Adsorbed natural gas (ANG) storage is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional compressed and liquefied storage methods. However, its onboard application is restricted by low volumetric methane storage capacity. Flexible porous adsorbents offer a potential solution, as their dense structures and unique gate‐opening effects are well‐suited to enhance volumetric capacity under high pressures. This study developes a series of hyper‐cross‐linked polymers (HCPs) with tunable flexibility by modifying the aliphatic chain length in double‐benzene‐ring building blocks, employing a cost‐effective external crosslinking approach. The resulting flexible polymer, HCP‐DPP, exhibits pore expansion under specific methane pressures, producing a high‐pressure adsorption isotherm with gate‐opening behavior. Combined with its intrinsic dense skeleton, this feature leads to superior volumetric methane storage performance over rigid counterparts. Notably, HCP‐DPP achieves a record‐high volumetric total uptake of 333 cm3 STP cm−3 and a working capacity of 291 cm3 STP cm−3 at 273 K and 100 bar, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) target of 263 cm3 STP cm−3. These findings lay a foundation for developing advanced flexible porous adsorbents for practical ANG applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents an effective strategy to address a longstanding challenge in the practical application of soft bioelectrodes: integrating excellent electrical performance, high compactness, and environmental durability. By leveraging the synergy between holey graphene and conductive polymer, this approach realizes reliable electron‐ion transduction through the construction of robust ionic and electronic transfer pathways at the molecular level.








Abstract
Bioelectrodes function as a critical interface for signal transduction between living organisms and electronics. Conducting polymers (CPs), particularly poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), are among the most promising materials for bioelectrodes, due to their electrical performance, high compactness, and ease of processing, but often suffer from degradation or de‐doping even in some common environments (e.g., electrical stimulation, chemicals, and high temperatures). This instability therefore severely undermines their reliability in practical application. To resolve this critical issue, a novel strategy of separating electron transfer from electron‐ion transduction is proposed. Specifically, chemically derived holey graphene (HG), serving as an ultra‐stable mixed ion‐electron conductor, is introduced into the CP matrix. The HG can restore the CP's destructed conductive pathways, whilst its porosity and its intercalation by the CP synergically preserve fast ionic and molecular diffusion. The resulting bioelectrode therefore exhibits excellent low impedance, high charge injection capacity, electrochemical activity, and outstanding resilience to various harsh conditions, outperforming HG, reduced graphene oxide, CP, or graphene‐coated CP electrodes. Furthermore, this strategy also exhibits broad compatibility with various processing techniques and proves adaptable to other electrode systems, such as stretchable electrodes, paving the way for practical applications in electrophysical capture, neuron modulation, and biochemical analysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The c‐B‐Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium–sulfur batteries. Consequently, c‐B‐Mo2C‐based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure–activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron‐deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h‐Mo2C) to cubic phase (c‐B‐Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron‐rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c‐B‐Mo2C based cell achieves a low‐capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm−2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah‐c‐B‐Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg−1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 µL mg S−1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg−1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Base editing using nanoneedles efficiently corrects pathogenic variants in the type VII collagen gene of primary fibroblasts from patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Nanoneedle editing induces minimal and reversible transcriptional perturbations while restoring the production and secretion of functional type VII collagen. The study highlights the value of nanoneedles as a tool for base editing in cell therapies for genetic disorders.








Abstract
Base editing, a CRISPR‐based genome editing technology, enables precise correction of single‐nucleotide variants, promising resolutive treatment for monogenic genetic disorders like recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). However, the application of base editors in cell manufacturing is hindered by inconsistent efficiency and high costs, contributed by suboptimal delivery methods. Nanoneedles have emerged as an effective delivery approach, enabling highly efficient, non‐perturbing gene therapies both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that nanoneedle delivery of an adenine base editor corrects a heterozygous single‐nucleotide pathogenic variant in COL7A1 in primary RDEB fibroblasts in vitro with 96.5% efficiency, without inducing off‐target variants. The nanoneedle delivery maintains cell viability and displays modest phenotypical alterations unlike conventional cationic lipid transfection. The nanoneedle‐mediated editing significantly increases the production and secretion of full‐length type VII collagen protein, contributing to restore functional fibroblasts phenotype by improving cell adhesion. These findings underscore the suitability and safety of nanoneedles for gene editing in a clinically relevant context of cell manufacturing, establishing a foundation for their use in cell therapies.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work proposes an in‐situ self‐welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure‐sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home‐based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in‐situ self‐welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., ≈700 J m−2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure‐sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long‐term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning‐assisted system using t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home‐based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.

In this work, the architecture of a plant fiber cell wall is simplified to design novel concepts of 4D printed tubular moisture‐driven structural actuators, using the hygromorphic properties of continuous flax fiber (cFF) reinforced materials named meta biocomposites. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device.








Abstract
Biological structures provide inspiration for developing advanced materials from sustainable resources, enabling passive structural morphing. Despite an increasing interest for parsimony‐oriented innovation, sustainable shape‐changing materials based on renewable resources remain underexplored. In this work, the architecture of a single plant fiber cell wall (S2, for instance) is simplified to design novel concepts of 4D printed tubular moisture‐driven structural actuators, using the hygromorphic properties of continuous flax fiber (cFF) reinforced materials. This new class of bioinspired active materials is referred to as metabiocomposites. Before bioinspired design, the materials are produced with a customized rotary 3D printer, qualified, and tested for sorption behavior. A parametric experimental, analytical, and FEA analysis highlights the programmability of the material through the effects of mesostructural parameters (printing inclination α) and geometric factors (operational length L, inner diameter D, and thickness h) on the actuation authority. The overall performance is a trade‐off between rotation and torque, with energy density comparable to that of the source of inspiration: natural fibers cell wall. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device, such as a solar tracker.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The development of hydrogel‐impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) aims to address stent migration by improving tissue adhesion and reducing mechanical mismatch in self‐expandable metallic stents (SEMSs). The network‐like porous layer of HiRINC enhances adhesion and energy dissipation, demonstrates through ex vivo and in vivo tests, effectively preventing migration in esophageal models.








Abstract
Migration of implanted self‐expandable metallic stent (SEMS) in the malignant or benign esophageal stricture is a common complication but not yet resolved. Herein, this research develops a hydrogel‐impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) to ensure adhesion and reduce the mechanical mismatch between SEMSs and esophageal tissues. Featuring a network‐like porous layer, HiRINC significantly enhances adhesion and energy dissipation during esophageal peristalsis by utilizing mechanical interlocking and increasing hydrogen bonding sites, thereby securing SEMS to tissues. The anti‐swelling property of HiRINC prevents excessive hydrogel expansion, avoiding esophageal blockage. Ex vivo and in vivo adhesion tests confirm that the HiRINC outperforms flat surfaces without RINC structures and effectively prevents stent migration. HiRINC‐coated SEMS maintains its position and luminal patency, minimizing stent‐induced tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory responses in rat and porcine esophageal models during the 4‐week follow‐up. This novel HiRINC‐SEMS can ensure anti‐migration and prolonged stent patency in the rat and porcine esophagus and seems to be expanded to other nonvascular luminal organs and various implantable metallic devices.

The Fe and Co/Ni sites in FeCoNiCuYP preferentially stabilize HO* and HOO* intermediates during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), disrupting the traditional scaling relation of Gibbs free energy for these intermediates. The FeCoNiCuYP/C demonstrates excellent OER performance, requiring low overpotentials of 316 mV@100 mA cm−2.








Abstract
The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mainly encompasses four elementary reactions, involving intermediates such as HO*, O*, and HOO*. Balancing the Gibbs free energies of these intermediates at a single active site is a challenging task. In this work, a high‐entropy metal‐organic framework incorporating Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Y metal elements is synthesized using an electrodeposition method, which then serves as a template for preparing a high‐entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine‐tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm−2 current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high‐entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting‐edge electrocatalytic applications.

Printed electronics, with their extensive versatility, resource efficiency, and fast‐prototyping capabilities, offer an attractive alternative to Si‐based CMOS technology. This paper reviews the recent advances in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies that could lead to high performance, as well as attributes such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and vertical stack leading to 3D integration.








Abstract
The pursuit of miniaturized Si electronics has revolutionized computing and communication. During recent years, the value addition in electronics has also been achieved through printing, flexible and stretchable electronics form factors, and integration over areas larger than wafer size. Unlike Si semiconductor manufacturing which takes months from tape‐out to wafer production, printed electronics offers greater flexibility and fast‐prototyping capabilities with lesser resources and waste generation. While significant advances have been made with various types of printed sensors and other passive devices, printed circuits still lag behind Si‐based electronics in terms of performance, integration density, and functionality. In this regard, recent advances using high‐resolution printing coupled with the use of high mobility materials and device engineering, for both in‐plane and out‐of‐plane integration, raise hopes. This paper focuses on the progress in printed electronics, highlighting emerging printing technologies and related aspects such as resource efficiency, environmental impact, integration scale, and the novel functionalities enabled by vertical integration of printed electronics. By highlighting these advances, this paper intends to reveal the future promise of printed electronics as a sustainable and resource‐efficient route for realizing high‐performance integrated circuits and systems.

Recent advances in operando characterizations and computational simulations have unveiled the unconventional and dynamic nature of surface‐bound reaction intermediates in aqueous electrochemical systems. By tailoring electronic properties and atomic structures of catalytic surfaces, researchers can manipulate adsorbate dynamics to enable energetically favorable reaction pathways, overcoming the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints inherent in conventional reaction mechanisms.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient catalysts to accelerate sluggish electrode reactions is critical for the deployment of sustainable aqueous electrochemical technologies, yet remains a great challenge. Rationally integrating functional components to tailor surface adsorption behaviors and adsorbate dynamics would divert reaction pathways and alleviate energy barriers, eliminating conventional thermodynamic constraints and ultimately optimizing energy flow within electrochemical systems.

This review explores the latest insights into the principles guiding the design of catalytic surfaces that enable favorable adsorbate dynamics within the contexts of hydrogen and oxygen electrochemistry. Innovative approaches for tailoring adsorbate‐surface interactions are discussed, delving into underlying principles that govern these dynamics. Additionally, perspectives on the prevailing challenges are presented and future research directions are proposed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc‐inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed, and the four proton storage reaction patterns, the proton storage, and transport processes are well refined. The characterization techniques of proton storage are carefully introduced. Especially, the four structural engineering of proton storage modulation are highlighted.








Abstract
The proton (H+) has been proved to be another important energy storage ion besides Zn2+ in aqueous zinc‐inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes. H+ storage usually possesses better thermodynamics and reaction kinetics than Zn2+, and is found to be an important addition for Zn2+ storage. Thus, understanding, characterizing, and modulating H+ storage in inorganic cathode materials is particularly important. In this review, recent advances regarding the proton storage chemistry in aqueous zinc‐inorganic batteries with moderate electrolytes are systematically reviewed. First, the four proton storage reaction patterns of H+ insertion, H+/Zn2+ co‐insertion, H+‐dependent conversion, and H+‐dependent dissolution/deposition reaction are explicitly presented. Meanwhile, the proton storage processes of multi‐sites and multi‐steps, and the Hopping and Grotthuss proton transport mechanisms are carefully introduced. Second, the characterization techniques of proton storage are systematically classified into four types of electrochemical characterization techniques of batteries, structural characterization techniques of inorganic cathodes, pH characterization technique of electrolyte, and quantitative analysis technologies of H+ storage contribution. Third, the structural engineering of proton storage modulation is preliminarily refined to be interlayer engineering, doping engineering, defect engineering, composite engineering, and other engineering. Finally, the emerging challenges and perspectives about future directions of proton storage chemistry are proposed.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by sweeping robots, a Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmer capable of cleaning off deleterious disease triggers is designed for the active therapy of ulcerative colitis. The self‐driven ability endows the microswimmer with augmented contact probability with surrounding disease triggers, which contributes to enhanced disease triggers removal efficiency, promising to achieve precise control of the inflammatory storms of ulcerative colitis.








Abstract
Overproduction of pathogenic cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays crucial roles in the onset and perpetuation of ulcerative colitis (UC). Inspired by sweeping robots, a magnesium@polylactic acid‐glycolic acid copolymer@polyethylenimine (Mg@PLGA@PEI) microswimmer capable of cleaning off deleterious disease triggers along its path of progress is designed. Mg@PLGA@PEI is successfully synthesized by adopting a core‐shell structure with a small opening which allows for Mg‐water reaction. The distinctive motility performance resulting from sustained detachment of the produced hydrogen not only contributes to strengthened hydrogen diffusion concomitant with potentiated ROS neutralization, but also facilitates the contacting probability with microenvironmental cfDNA and thus enhances the DNA binding efficiency. By integrating these merits, the developed Mg@PLGA@PEI confers desirable curative efficacy in a classical DSS‐induced acute colitis mouse model. Enema administration of Mg@PLGA@PEI microswimmers substantially alleviates the manifestations related to UC, as evidenced by the body weight recovery, colon length retention, colon tissue protection, and attenuated intestinal inflammation, which is attributed to the active scavenging of cfDNA and ROS. This work provides a paradigm for a drug‐free strategy competent in spontaneously eliminating causative triggers with minimal side effects, which presents a promising alternative for the active therapy of UC or other cfDNA‐ and ROS‐related diseases in the clinic.

<title>Tissue Mimetic Membranes for Healing Augmentation of Tendon–Bone Interface in Rotator Cuff Repair</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Here, a tissue‐mimetic membrane for functional tendon–bone interface regeneration is fabricated. During the implantation, a biomimicry and inductive microenvironment is created by the region‐specific configuration and spatiotemporal release of chondroinductive kartogenin‐conjugated nanogel (nGel‐KGN) and osteoinductive struvite. The In Vitro and in vivo findings validate the prominent regenerative efficacy in rotator cuff repair.








Abstract
The globally prevalent rotator cuff tear has a high re‐rupture rate, attributing to the failure to reproduce the interfacial fibrocartilaginous enthesis. Herein, a hierarchically organized membrane is developed that mimics the heterogeneous anatomy and properties of the natural enthesis and finely facilitates the reconstruction of tendon–bone interface. A biphasic membrane consisting of a microporous layer and a mineralized fibrous layer is constructed through the non‐solvent induced phase separation (NIPS) strategy followed by a co‐axial electrospinning procedure. Cationic kartogenin (KGN)‐conjugated nanogel (nGel‐KGN) and osteo‐promotive struvite are incorporated within the membranes in a region‐specific manner. During in vivo repair, the nGel‐KGN‐functionalized microporous layer is adjacent to the tendon which intends to suppress scar tissue formation at the lesion and simultaneously heightens chondrogenesis. Meanwhile, the struvite‐containing fibrous layer covers the tubercula minus to enhance stem cell aggregation and bony ingrowth. Such tissue‐specific features and spatiotemporal release behaviors contribute to effective guidance of specific defect‐healing events at the transitional region, further leading to the remarkably promoted regenerative outcome in terms of the fibrocartilaginous tissue formation, collagen fiber alignment, and optimized functional motion of rotator cuff. These findings render a novel biomimetic membrane as a promising material for clinical rotator cuff repair.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for advanced high‐power capacitors. Atomic‐scale investigations determine that introduction of specific elements (Mg, La, Ca, and Sr) can enhance ferroelectric relaxation behavior by different magnitudes. Disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall polar nanoscale regions are detected in the high‐entropy ceramics after introducing trace amounts of Mg and La. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J cm−3 and efficiency of 90% are achieved in a designed high‐entropy ceramic.








Abstract
Dielectric ceramics with high energy storage performance are crucial for the development of advanced high‐power capacitors. However, achieving ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density and efficiency remains challenging, limiting the progress of leading‐edge energy storage applications. In this study, (Bi1/2Na1/2)TiO3 (BNT) is selected as the matrix, and the effects of different A‐site elements on domain morphology, lattice polarization, and dielectric and ferroelectric properties are systematically investigated. Mg, La, Ca, and Sr are shown to enhance relaxation behavior by different magnitudes; hence, a high‐entropy strategy for designing local polymorphic distortions is proposed. Based on atomic‐scale investigations, a series of BNT‐based high‐entropy compositions are designed by introducing trace amounts of Mg and La to improve the electric breakdown strength and further disrupt the polar nanoscale regions (PNRs). A disordered polarization distribution and ultrasmall PNRs with a minimum size of ≈1 nm are detected in the high‐entropy ceramics. Ultimately, a high recoverable energy density of 10.1 J cm−3 and an efficiency of 90% are achieved for (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2Mg0.05La0.05Bi0.15Na0.15)TiO3. Furthermore, it displays a high‐power density of 584 MW cm−3 and an ultrashort discharge time of 27 ns. This work presents an effective approach for designing dielectric energy storage materials with superior comprehensive performance via a high‐entropy strategy.

Paving the way towards 3D light‐based (bio)printing with spatiotemporal control over structural and mechanical properties—Xolography of hydrogel‐based photoresins enables the fabrication of high‐resolution constructs with locally modulated stiffness and programmable shape changes.








Abstract
Current challenges in tissue engineering include creation of extracellular environments that support and interact with cells using biochemical, mechanical, and structural cues. Spatial control over these cues is currently limited due to a lack of suitable fabrication techniques. This study introduces Xolography, an emerging dual‐color light‐sheet volumetric printing technology, to achieve control over structural and mechanical features for hydrogel‐based photoresins at micro‐ to macroscale while printing within minutes. A water‐soluble photoswitch photoinitiator system and a library of naturally‐derived, synthetic, and thermoresponsive hydrogels for Xolography are proposed. Centimeter‐scale, 3D constructs with positive features of 20 µm and negative features of ≈100 µm are fabricated with control over mechanical properties (compressive moduli 0.2 kPa–6.5 MPa). Notably, switching from binary to grayscaled light projection enables spatial control over stiffness (0.2–16 kPa). As a proof of concept, grayscaled Xolography is leveraged with thermoresponsive hydrogels to introduce reversible anisotropic shape changes beyond isometric shrinkage. Xolography of viable cell aggregates is finally demonstrated, laying the foundation for cell‐laden printing of dynamic, cell‐instructive environments with tunable structural and mechanical cues in a fast one‐step process. Overall, these innovations unlock unique possibilities of Xolography across multiple biomedical applications.

<title>Regio‐Selective Mechanical Enhancement of Polymer‐Grafted Nanoparticle Composites via Light‐Mediated Crosslinking</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Light‐mediated crosslinkers are incorporated into a polymer‐grafted nanoparticle composite system. This method enables >15‐fold enhancement of tensile modulus upon crosslinking and can be applied to a wide range of monomer compositions. Furthermore, the regio‐selective nature of photocrosslinking allows for the fabrication of compositionally continuous composites with intentionally designed anisotropic mechanical responses, demonstrated via the fabrication of a stiffness‐patterned soft electronic substrate.








Abstract
Polymer‐brush‐grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs) that can be covalently crosslinked post‐processing enable the fabrication of mechanically robust and chemically stable polymer nanocomposites with high inorganic filler content. Modifying PGNP brushes to append UV‐activated crosslinkers along the polymer chains would permit a modular crosslinking strategy applicable to a diverse range of nanocomposite compositions. Further, light‐activated crosslinking reactions enable spatial control of crosslink density to program intentionally inhomogeneous mechanical responses. Here, a method of synthesizing composites using UV‐crosslinkable brush‐coated nanoparticles (referred to as UV‐XNPs) is introduced that can be applied to various monomer compositions by incorporating photoinitiators into the polymer brushes. UV crosslinking of processed UV‐XNP structures can increase their tensile modulus up to 15‐fold without any noticeable alteration to their appearance or shape. By using photomasks to alter UV intensity across a sample, intentionally designed inhomogeneities in crosslink density result in predetermined anisotropic shape changes under strain. This unique capability of UV‐XNP materials is applied to stiffness‐patterned flexible electronic substrates that prevent the delamination of rigid components under deformation. The potential of UV‐XNPs as functional, soft device components is further demonstrated by wearable devices that can be modified post‐fabrication to customize their performance, permitting the ability to add functionality to existing device architectures.

The 2D Cr5Te6 nanosheets are systematically synthesized with an in situ formed ≈2 nm‐thick Te doped Cr2O3 layer (Te‐Cr2O3) on the upper surface by chemical vapor deposition method. The strong and air stable EB effect, achieving a |HEB/HC| of up to 80% under an ultralow cooling field of 0.01 T, which is greater than that of the reported 2D magnetic heterostructures.








Abstract
The exchange bias (EB) effect is a fundamental magnetic phenomenon, in which the exchange bias field/coercive field ratio (|HEB/HC|) can improve the stability of spintronic devices. Two‐dimensional (2D) magnetic heterostructures have the potential to construct low‐power and high‐density spintronic devices, while their typically air unstable and |HEB/HC| lesser, limiting the possibility of applications. Here, 2D Cr5Te6 nanosheets have been systematically synthesized with an in situ formed ≈2 nm‐thick Te doped Cr2O3 layer (Te‐Cr2O3) on the upper surface by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The strong and air stable EB effect, achieving a |HEB/HC| of up to 80% under an ultralow cooling field of 0.01 T, which is greater than that of the reported 2D magnetic heterostructures. Meanwhile, the uniformity of thickness and chemical composition of the Te‐Cr2O3 layer can be controlled by the growth conditions which are highly correlated with the EB effect of 2D Te‐Cr2O3/Cr5Te6 heterostructures. First‐principles calculations show that the Te‐Cr2O3 can provide uncompensated spins in the Cr2O3, thus forming strong spin pinning effect. The systematical investigation of the EB effect in 2D Te‐Cr2O3/Cr5Te6 heterostructures with high |HEB/HC| will open up exciting opportunities in low‐power and high‐stability 2D spintronic devices.

<title>Heterodimeric Photosensitizer as Radical Generators to Promoting Type I Photodynamic Conversion for Hypoxic Tumor Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In heterodimeric NBSSe, the NBS/NBSe radical pair formation in the co‐excited NBSSe* after intramolecular electron transfer successfully converts type II into type I photodynamic pathway on a traditional type II photosensitizer NBSe of high reactive oxygen species yield. Incorporating electron‐rich BSA further promotes O2‐· generation and photostability of this radical generator via recycling radicals, with an efficient tumor targeting capability for BSA@NBSSe.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using traditional type II photosensitizers (PSs) has been limited in hypoxic tumors due to excessive oxygen consumption. The conversion from type II into a less oxygen‐dependent type I PDT pathway has shown the potential to combat hypoxic tumors. Herein, the design of a heterodimeric PS, NBSSe, by conjugating a widely used type I PS NBS and a type II PS NBSe via molecular dimerization, achieving the aggregation‐regulated efficient type I photodynamic conversion for the first time is reported. Electrochemistry characterizations and theoretical calculations elucidate that NBSSe tends to form a S+·/Se−· radical pair via intramolecular electron transfer in the co‐excited NBSSe* aggregate, realizing 7.25‐fold O2−· generation compared to NBS and 80% suppression of 1O2 generation compared to NBSe. The enhanced O2−· generation of NBSSe enables excellent anti‐hypoxia PDT efficiency and inhibition of pulmonary metastasis. Additionally, the incorporation of electron‐rich bovine serum albumin accelerates the recycling of cationic PS radical NBSSe+·, further boosting photostability and O2−· generation. The resultant BSA@NBSSe nanoparticles demonstrate successful tumor‐targeting PDT capability. This work provides an appealing avenue to convert ROS generation from the type II pathway to the type I pathway for efficient cancer phototherapy in hypoxia.

<title>Self‐assembled Gap‐Rich PdMn Nanofibers with High Mass/Electron Transport Highways for Electrocatalytic Reforming of Waste Plastics</title>

A unique self‐assembled gap‐rich PdMn nanofibers, featuring with high mass/electron transport highways, which is used as an efficient catalyst of polyethylene terephthalate to high‐valued glycolic acid at an industrial current.








Abstract
Innovating nanocatalysts with both high intrinsic catalytic activity and high selectivity is crucial for multi‐electron reactions, however, their low mass/electron transport at industrial‐level currents is often overlooked, which usually leads to low comprehensive performance at the device level. Herein, a Cl−/O2 etching‐assisted self‐assembly strategy is reported for synthesizing a self‐assembled gap‐rich PdMn nanofibers with high mass/electron transport highway for greatly enhancing the electrocatalytic reforming of waste plastics at industrial‐level currents. The self‐assembled PdMn nanofiber shows excellent catalytic activity in upcycling waste plastics into glycolic acid, with a high current density of 223 mA cm−2@0.75 V (vs RHE), high selectivity (95.6%), and Faraday efficiency (94.3%) to glycolic acid in a flow electrolyzer. Density functional theory calculation, X‐ray absorption spectroscopy combined with in situ electrochemical Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of highly oxophilic Mn induces a downshift of the d‐band center of Pd, which optimizes the adsorption energy of the reaction intermediates on PdMn surface, thereby facilitating the desorption of glycolic acid as a high‐value product. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirm that the gap‐rich nanofiber structure is conducive for mass transfer to deliver an industrial‐level current.

<title>PerC B‐Cells Activation via Thermogenetics‐Based CXCL12 Generator for Intraperitoneal Immunity Against Metastatic Disseminated Tumor Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An isotropic‐porous, cell‐fitting, thermogenetics‐based chemokine CXCL12 generator is described as a B‐cell‐dependent intraperitoneal immunotherapy that can trigger intraperitoneal anti‐tumor immunity against metastatic disseminated tumor cell to assuage peritoneal effusion and peritoneal metastasis. Unexpectedly, the peritoneal cavity B cell subset is identified as playing a key role in exogenous antigen presentation and presenting a unique transcriptional signature.








Abstract
During cancer peritoneal metastasis (PM), conventional antigen‐presenting cells (dendritic cells, macrophages) promote tumorigenesis and immunosuppression in peritoneal cavity. While intraperitoneal immunotherapy (IPIT) has been used in clinical investigations to relieve PM, the limited knowledge of peritoneal immunocytes has hindered the development of therapeutic IPIT. Here, a dendritic cell‐independent, next‐generation IPIT is described that activates peritoneal cavity B (PerC B) cell subsets for intraperitoneal anti‐tumor immunity via exogenous antigen presentation. The PerC B‐cell‐involved IPIT framework consists of an isotropic‐porous, cell‐fitting, thermogenetics‐based CXCL12 generator. Such nanoscale thermal‐confined generator can programmatically fine‐tune the expression of CXCL12 to recruit disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) through CXCL12‐CXCR4 axis while avoiding cytokine storm, subsequently release DTC‐derived antigen to trigger PerC B‐cell‐involved immunity. Notably, antigen‐presenting B‐cell cluster, expressing the regulatory signaling molecules Ptpn6, Ms4a1, and Cd52, is identified playing the key role in the IPIT via single‐cell RNA sequencing. Moreover, such IPIT availably assuages peritoneal effusion and PM in an orthotopic gastric cancer and metastatic model. Overall, this work offers a perspective on PerC B‐cell‐involved antigen‐presenting in intraperitoneal immunity and provides a configurable strategy for activating anti‐DTC immunity for next‐generation IPIT.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bio‐scaffolded lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli is developed as a simple, effective material for repeated capture and release of rare earth elements (REEs). Over 80% of four REE cations are captured, even in the presence of excess competitive ions. The material can be employed in a filtration flow‐through system with a capture capacity of 11.8 ± 0.9 mg g−1 dry cell weight.








Abstract
Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential for many clean energy technologies. Yet, they are a limited resource currently obtained through carbon‐intensive mining. Here, bio‐scaffolded proteins serve as simple, effective materials for the recovery of REEs. Surface expression of the protein lanmodulin (LanM) on E. coli, followed by freeze‐drying of the microbes, yields a displayed protein material for REE recovery. Four REE cations (Y3+, La3+, Gd3+, and Tb3+) are captured efficiently, with over 80% recovery even in the presence of competitive ions at one‐hundred‐fold excess. Moreover, these materials are readily integrated into a filter with high capture capacity (12 mg g−1 dry cell weight) for the selective isolation and recovery of REEs from complex matrices. Further, the proteins in the filter remain stable over ten bind‐and‐release cycles and a week of storage. To improve the deployability of this filter material, a simple colorimetric assay with the dye alizarin‐3‐methyliminodiacetic acid is incorporated. The assay can be performed in under 5 min, enabling rapid monitoring of REE recovery and filter efficiency. Overall, this low‐cost, robust material will enable environmentally friendly recycling and recovery of critical elements.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
LNP is modified by a novel STING‐activating polymer (PD) to enhance immune effect of mRNA vaccines by boosting cellular uptake and triggering robust immune activation. Optimizing the polymerization of PD significantly amplifies mRNA translation efficiency and STING‐mediated immune responses, offering a powerful approach to advance mRNA‐based immunotherapy.









Abstract
The unprecedented success of mRNA vaccines against COVID‐19 has inspired scientists to develop mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy. However, using nucleoside modified mRNA as vaccine, though evading innate immune toxicity, diminishes its therapeutic efficacy for cancers. Here, we report a polyvalent stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activating polymer (termed as PD) to bolster the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccine. PD is made of tertiary amine units and conjugated with a biodegradable alkyl chain. Co‐formulation of PDs bearing different number of tertiary amines with lipid materials and mRNA resulted in the lipid‐like nanoparticles (PD LNPs) which effectively promoted lymphatic delivery and elicited robust immune activation via the STING signaling pathway. Notably, PD with eighteen tertiary amines (PD18) is predominant in balancing immune activity and tolerability. Subcutaneous administration of PD18 LNPs containing ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA enhanced the frequency of antigen specific CD8+ T cell with immune memory, leading to potent anticancer efficacy that surpassed 2′3’‐cGAMP in both prophylactic and therapeutic cancer models. Additionally, PD18 LNP‐based mRNA vaccine showed conferred resistance to cancer challenge for up to 60 days. Overall, this study offers a new perspective of using STING‐ activating polymer for imparting synergistic activity in mRNA vaccine‐based cancer immunotherapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) is developed for advanced molecular classification of processing multiple inputs. By minimizing oligonucleotide requirements, DDSD enables binary and multiclass molecular classification in a simplified manner. It has been successfully applied in infection diagnostics and pathogen identification using blood samples. Computing capability can be further enhanced by cascade DDSD and multiway junction DDSD.








Abstract
DNA‐based molecular computing systems for biomarkers have emerged as powerful tools for intelligent diagnostics. However, with the variety of feature biomarkers expanding, current molecular computing systems suffer from the use of a large number of oligonucleotides and limited encoding capability. Here, the study develops an alternative molecular computing approach termed Digital DNA Strand Displacement (DDSD) which recognizes targets and operates target valence through DNA polymerase‐based extension and strand release. DDSD significantly reduced the number of used oligonucleotide species, provided robust molecular classifiers. In clinical blood samples, a 96% accuracy rate is achieved with a DDSD‐based binary classifier for distinguishing bacterial and viral infections, a 100% accuracy rate is achieved with a multiclass classifier for identifying pathogen types, surpassing existing classifier systems. Moreover, DDSD can be readily expanded. Cascade DDSD is developed, enabling simultaneous computing of up to 14 valence states with a maximum valence of 25. Multiway junction DDSD is implemented to achieve high‐valence computing by compact DNA nanostructures rather than split DNA computing units, reducing the potential leakage. The implementation of DDSD enhances the capability of valence‐based intelligent molecular diagnostics and multiplexed biomarker detection.

<title>Electroactive Dressing with Selective Sorption of Exudate Enables Treatment of Complicated Wound</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electroactive dressing (cMO/PVA) designed via a facile bilayer composite approach and charging procedure integrates selective sorption, long‐term electrical stimulation therapy, and antibacterial properties simultaneously, showing an appealing application prospect for complicated wound repair.








Abstract
Exudate management and cell activity enhancement are vital to complicated wound healing. However, current exudate management dressings indiscriminately remove exudate, which is detrimental to cell activity enhancement. Herein, a novel class of electroactive bilayer (cMO/PVA) dressing is developed by constructing manganese oxide nanoneedle‐clusters decorated commercial carbon cloth (MO), in situ casting polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, and finally charging. Benefitting from the hierarchical nanoneedle‐cluster structure of MO, abundant active sites are sufficiently exposed to achieve high area‐specific capacitances (e.g., 1881.3 mF cm−2), thereby establishing the long‐lasting electric field for cMO/PVA dressing. Such a unique cMO/PVA dressing can realize extraordinary selective sorption toward noxious substances over nutrient substances during exudate management. Meanwhile, its long‐term electrical stimulation therapy can promote cell proliferation and migration and enhance antibacterial property. As a result, our multifunctional cMO/PVA dressing can rapidly repair full‐thickness wounds in type II diabetic rats, offering an advanced strategy for the treatment of complicated wounds.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Unveiling the mechanism of high‐entropy single‐atom catalysts (HESAC), this study reveals how long‐range interactions and entropy govern electron states, enhancing electrocatalysis for lithium–sulfur batteries with a superior rate capacity of 3.4 mAh cm−2 at 10 C.








Abstract
Sulfur conversion reactions are the foundation of lithium–sulfur batteries but usually possess sluggish kinetics during practical battery operation. Herein, a high‐entropy single‐atom catalyst (HESAC) is synthesized for this process. In contrast to conventional dual‐atom catalysts that form metal–metal bonds, the center metal atoms in HESAC are not bonded but exhibit long‐range interactions at a sub‐nanometer distance (<9 Å). The synergistic effect between the long‐range interactions and entropy changes enables the regulation of d‐ and π‐electron states. This alteration in the electronic structure improves the adsorption and electronic conductivity of intermediate polysulfides, thereby accelerating their conversion kinetics. Consequently, this leads to a significant enhancement in specific capacities by ≈40% at high rates compared to single‐atom catalysts. The resulting lithium–sulfur battery with HESAC demonstrates a remarkable areal capacity of 3.4 mAh cm−2 at 10 C. These findings provide valuable insights into the design principle of metal atom catalysts for electrochemical reactions.

<title>Efficient Spin‐Light‐Emitting Diodes With Tunable Red to Near‐Infrared Emission at Room Temperature</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A series of chiral quasi‐2D perovskites are reported with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in films and circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) in spin‐LEDs in the red to near‐infrared spectrum region. Spectroscopic studies show that the CPL and CPEL originate from an energy and spin funnel process in the chiral quasi‐2D perovskites.








Abstract
Spin light‐emitting diodes (spin‐LEDs) are important for spin‐based electronic circuits as they convert the carrier spin information to optical polarization. Recently, chiral‐induced spin selectivity (CISS) has emerged as a new paradigm to enable spin‐LED as it does not require any magnetic components and operates at room temperature. However, CISS‐enabled spin‐LED with tunable wavelengths ranging from red to near‐infrared (NIR) has yet to be demonstrated. Here, chiral quasi‐2D perovskites are developed to fabricate efficient spin‐LEDs with tunable wavelengths from red to NIR region by tuning the halide composition. The optimized chiral perovskite films exhibit efficient circularly polarized luminescence from 675 to 788 nm, with a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) exceeding 86% and a dissymmetry factor (glum) ranging from 8.5 × 10−3 to 2.6 × 10−2. More importantly, direct circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) is achieved at room temperature in spin‐LEDs. This work demonstrated efficient red and NIR spin‐LEDs with the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaching 12.4% and the electroluminescence (EL) dissymmetry factors (gEL) ranging from 3.7 × 10−3 to 1.48 × 10−2 at room temperature. The composition‐dependent CPEL performance is further attributed to the prolonged spin lifetime as revealed by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A nucleation‐controlled strategy is developed, to grow Dion−Jacobson phase 2D chiral perovskite single crystal thin films (SCTFs), from water‐air interface, with a novel chiral ligand, (R/S)‐3‐Aminopyrrolidine. The obtained ultrathin SCTFs, with shortened spacing between inorganic layers, exhibit reduced exciton binding energy and enhanced carrier transport. In results, photodetectors based on the SCTFs show superior sensitivity to the circularly polarized light.








Abstract
2D Dion−Jacobson (DJ) chiral perovskite materials exhibit significant promise for developing high‐performance circularly polarized light (CPL) photodetectors. However, the inherently thick nature of DJ‐phase 2D perovskite single crystal limits their ability to differentiate CPL photons with the two opposite polarization states. In addition, the growth of DJ‐phase perovskite single crystal thin films (SCTFs) has proven challenging due to the strong interlayer electronic coupling. Here, a nucleation‐controlled strategy is employed to grow a novel DJ‐phase perovskite [(R/S)‐3APr]PbI4 [(R/S)‐3APr = (R/S)‐3‐Aminopyrrolidine] SCTFs with large area, low thickness and hence high aspect ratios. Structural and photoluminescence analyses reveal that introducing the divalent organic cations into the perovskite framework reduce the interlayer distance, resulting in low exciton binding energy. This facilitates charge separation and transport. The resulting SCTF photodetector showcases excellent detection performance with anisotropy factor for photocurrent as high as 0.65, responsivity of 1.97 A W−1, detectivity of 5.3 × 1013 Jones, and 3‐dB frequency of 2940 Hz, demonstrating its potential as a promising candidate for CPL‐sensitive photodetectors. This novel approach, therefore, provides a framework for the growth of DJ‐phase perovskite SCTFs and advances their applications in sensitive CPL photodetection.

<title>Influence of Free Space on Lithium Growth Behavior at Open Surfaces and Internal Cracks of Sulfide‐Based Solid Electrolyte</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lithium growth follows two modes within the crack of argyrodite sulfide solid electrolyte: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side‐wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side‐wall surface toward the free space inside the crack.








Abstract
Lithium dendrite penetration through solid electrolyte has been the major obstacle for practical sulfide‐based all‐solid‐state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs). Herein, a series of tailored model solid cells are designed to investigate the intrinsic lithium growth behavior at open surfaces and internal cracks of sulfide solid electrolyte. It is shown that when plating lithium on the open surface of electrolyte (free space), the lithium exhibits an intrinsic columnar growth behavior perpendicular to the electrolyte surface, preferentially along the (110) crystal axis. When plating lithium within the internal cracks (confined free space), the growth of lithium follows two major modes: 1) Diffusion creep enabled infiltration along the crack side‐wall surface toward the counter electrode, allowing the deposited lithium to cause short circuit without fully filling the crack; 2) Columnar growth perpendicular to the crack side‐wall surface toward the confined free space inside the crack. The extent of lithium ingress into electrolyte under external pressure in the initial state is found to determine the rate of lithium infiltration after applying the current. As a further validation, intact sintered electrolytes with 99% relative density minimize initial lithium ingress, enabling lithium plating at 6.37 mA cm−2 with an areal capacity exceeding 76 mAh cm−2 without short circuit.

Graph theory modeling of RGD nano inter‐relation inversely proportional to the shortest path distance and proportional to the corresponding number of possible instances is harnessed. RGD nano inter‐relation can be regulated by modulating the aspect ratio of magnetic nanobars, which can be increased by unidirectionally aligning or reversibly lifting magnetic nanobars, thereby promoting integrin‐bearing filopodia penetration and adhesion‐mediated pro‐regenerative polarization of host macrophages.








Abstract
Graph theory has been widely used to quantitatively analyze complex networks of molecules, materials, and cells. Analyzing the dynamic complex structure of extracellular matrix can predict cell‐material interactions but has not yet been demonstrated. In this study, graph theory‐based mathematical modeling of RGD ligand graph inter‐relation is demonstrated by differentially cutting off RGD‐to‐RGD interlinkages with flexibly conjugated magnetic nanobars (MNBs) with tunable aspect ratio. The RGD‐to‐RGD interlinkages are less effectively cut off by MNBs with a lower aspect ratio, which decreases the shortest path while increasing the number of instances thereof, thereby augmenting RGD nano inter‐relation. This facilitates integrin recruitment of macrophages and thus actin fiber assembly and vinculin expression, which mediates pro‐regenerative polarization, involving myosin II, actin polymerization, and rho‐associated protein kinase. Unidirectional pre‐aligning or reversibly lifting highly elongated MNBs both increase RGD nano inter‐relation, which promotes host macrophage adhesion and switches their polarization from pro‐inflammatory to pro‐regenerative phenotype. The latter approach produces nano‐spaces through which macrophages can penetrate and establish RGD links thereunder. Using graph theory, this study presents the example of mathematically modeling the functionality of extracellular‐matrix‐mimetic materials, which can help elucidate complex dynamics of the interactions occurring between host cells and materials via versatile geometrical nano‐engineering.

<title>Nanomagnetism Triggering Carriers Double‐Resistance Conduction and Excellent Flexible Thermoelectrics</title>

Nanomagnetism‐triggered double‐resistance conduction greatly enhances thermoelectric performance of Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/epoxy films with a maximum zT of 1.44 at 320 K, providing insights into magnetism‐enhanced thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Nanomagnetism may enable electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient to be decoupled and can potentially lead to remarkable enhancements in thermoelectric (TE) performance, however, their physical mechanisms have not been explored. Herein, it is shown that the nanomagnetism from Fe and Fe3O4 nanoparticles embedded in Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/epoxy flexible films can lead to the carriers splitting into spin‐up and spin‐down conductive branches with different resistances and mobilities due to the exchange interaction between the spin of carriers and the nanomagnetism. The double‐resistance conduction of carriers may well explain the decoupling of electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient and their simultaneous enhancements in the thermo‐electro‐magnetic flexible films. It is further shown that the maximum dimensionless figure of merit of the thermo‐electro‐magnetic flexible films reaches between 1.2 and 1.4 at room temperature, and their five‐level cascaded device based on the films achieves a temperature drop of 3.1 K through in‐plane heat dissipation, making a new record for printing flexible TE films and devices. The double‐resistance conduction of carriers also reveals a deep physical mechanism for magneto‐enhanced TE performance of bulk thermoelectrics.

<title>Oriented Cortical‐Bone‐Like Silk Protein Lamellae Effectively Repair Large Segmental Bone Defects in Pigs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Silk proteins can be fabricated into large scaffolds with cortical‐bone‐like lamellar structures through freeze‐casting. The resultant freeze‐cast scaffolds are made of parallel silk protein lamellae and can be implanted into pig models to achieve effective bone regeneration without side effects.









Abstract
Assembling natural proteins into large, strong, bone‐mimetic scaffolds for repairing bone defects in large‐animal load‐bearing sites remain elusive. Here this challenge is tackled by assembling pure silk fibroin (SF) into 3D scaffolds with cortical‐bone‐like lamellae, superior strength, and biodegradability through freeze‐casting. The unique lamellae promote the attachment, migration, and proliferation of tissue‐regenerative cells (e.g., mesenchymal stem cells [MSCs] and human umbilical vein endothelial cells) around them, and are capable of developing in vitro into cortical‐bone organoids with a high number of MSC‐derived osteoblasts. High‐SF‐content lamellar scaffolds, regardless of MSC inoculation, regenerated more bone than non‐lamellar or low‐SF‐content lamellar scaffolds. They accelerated neovascularization by transforming macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotype, promoting bone regeneration to repair large segmental bone defects (LSBD) in minipigs within three months, even without growth factor supplements. The bone regeneration can be further enhanced by controlling the orientation of the lamella to be parallel to the long axis of bone during implantation. This work demonstrates the power of oriented lamellar bone‐like protein scaffolds in repairing LSBD in large animal models.

<title>Advancing Room‐Temperature Magnetic Semiconductors with Organic Radical Charge Transfer Cocrystals</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Pure organic room‐temperature ferromagnetic semiconductors are constructed in organic radical cocrystals by a simple solution‐process method. It is suggested that the primary sources of the boosting in magnetic and electrical properties are the enhancement of charge‐transfer interactions induced by radicals.








Abstract
Developing purely organic room‐temperature magnetic semiconductors has been a long‐sought goal in the material community toward the simultaneous control of spin and charge. Organic cocrystals, known for their structural versatility and multifunctionality, are ideal candidates for these magnetoelectric coupling applications. However, organic room‐temperature magnetic semiconductor cocrystals have rarely been reported, and their mechanisms remain poorly understood due to the complexity of cocrystal structures. Here, doping organic cocrystals with radicals offers a promising strategy for boosting their magnetism and conductivity while maintaining their cocrystal structures. The fluoranthene‐7,7,8,8‐tetracyanoquinodimethane radical (FA‐HTCNQ•) is constructed through a simple, rapid, and eco‐friendly solution‐processing approach. The conductive FA‐HTCNQ• exhibits excellent room‐temperature ferromagnetism with the coercive fields of 96 Oe and the Curie temperature near 400 K, superior to its structural‐identical undoped counterpart. Meanwhile, the room‐temperature magnetoelectric coupling is demonstrated in the conductive FA‐HTCNQ•. The stronger ferromagnetism and conductivity in organic cocrystals are attributed to the enhanced charge‐transfer (CT) interactions induced by radicals, rather than the spin exchange interactions between these radicals alone. The research manifests the origin of ferromagnetism in organic cocrystals and provides a simple strategy to fabricate pure organic room‐temperature magnetic semiconductor materials for future integrated magnetoelectric devices.

<title>Improving the Scintillation Performance of PEA2PbBr4 Through Zn2+ and Sb3+ Interstitial Doping Strategy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
PEA2PbBr4 is a promising scintillator for γ‐rays and nf detection. However, its energy resolution in γ‐rays detection is poor and the ability to discriminate nf/γ‐rays has not been accurately reported. It is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping enhances light yield and optimizes luminescence. Improved scintillator achieves 4.84% and 5.65% energy resolution at 662 keV and effective discrimination in γ‐rays/nf detection.








Abstract
Organic‐inorganic halide 2D perovskite single crystals have recently emerged as promising scintillators for gamma (γ) rays and fast neutrons (nf) detection. However, their energy resolution in γ‐rays detection still significantly lags behind that of perovskite semiconductor detectors. Improving crystal defects and enhancing light yield to optimize light output detected by the photomultiplier tube are crucial strategies for addressing this issue. Herein, it is demonstrated that Zn2+ and Sb3+ cation interstitial doping strategy can effectively reduce internal defects within the phenylethylammonium lead bromide (PEA2PbBr4) crystal by regulating lattice expansion. This approach also suppresses light loss caused by exciton‐exciton annihilation and accelerates electron‐hole recombination processes, optimizing both the luminescence intensity and decay lifetime of the scintillator. The Zn2+ and Sb3+ doping PEA2PbBr4 scintillator achieve an optimal energy resolution of 4.84% and 5.65% at 662 keV for the photopeak, respectively. Additionally, in the 241Am‐Be field, effective identification of nf and γ‐rays around 1100 keVee is achieved using a pulse shape discrimination (PSD) method, with the figure of merit (FOM) being 0.85 and 1.03, respectively. This work provides a reliable new approach for optimizing the scintillation performance of 2D perovskite and promotes the application of 2D perovskite scintillator in γ‐rays and nf detection.

<title>Giant Modulation of Magnetoresistance in a Van Der Waals Magnet by In‐Plane Current Injection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study reveals the transition of magnetic interlayer coupling in a van der Waals (vdW) magnet driven by an in‐plane electrical bias, leading to a significant modulation of magnetoresistance. This finding introduces a novel approach to controlling magnetization through electrical bias for spintronic applications with vdW magnets.









Abstract
Efficient magnetization control is a central issue in magnetism and spintronics. Particularly, there are increasing demands for manipulation of magnetic states in van der Waals (vdW) magnets with unconventional functionalities. However, the electrically induced phase transition between ferromagnetic‐to‐antiferromagnetic states without external magnetic field is yet to be demonstrated. Here, the current‐induced magnetic phase transition in a vdW ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 is reported. Based on magneto‐transport measurements and theoretical analysis, it is demonstrated that transition in the interlayer magnetic coupling occurs through vertical voltage drop between layers induced by current which is attributed to high anisotropy of the resistivity caused by the vdW gaps. Such magnetic phase transition results in giant modulation of the longitudinal magnetoresistance from 5% to 170%. The electrical tunability of the magnetic phase in Fe5GeTe2 with current‐in‐plane geometry opens a path for electric control of magnetic properties, expanding the ability to use vdW magnets for spintronic applications.

<title>Building a Highly Stable Red/Near Infrared Afterglow Library with Highly Branched Structures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An efficient approach is presented for achieving a stable red/NIR afterglow with high brightness and durability at high temperatures from branched luminogens. The advantages and universality of branched luminogen@red/near‐infrared dye systems are demonstrated by varying the topological structures of the lumonigens using different numbers of branches (two to eight branches) and cores and employing dyes of different sizes.








Abstract
Achieving organic red/near infrared (NIR) phosphorescence at high temperatures is theoretically challenging because of the severe nonradiative transitions of excited triplet states with low energy gaps. This study realizes bright and persistent red/NIR afterglow with excellent high‐temperature resistance up to 413 K via highly efficient (≈100%) phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (PRET) from rationally designed branched phosphorescence luminogens as energy donors to red/NIR dyes as acceptors, coupled with optimized aggregated structures. According to systematic investigations, the abundant internal cavities formed by the highly branched luminogens in solid states ensure dye loading and space limitation, which can considerably suppress nonradiative transitions at high temperatures, promoting a persistent red/NIR afterglow with excellent stability. Moreover, 16 types of host–guest systems with varied topological structures of branched luminogens and different red/NIR dyes of various sizes confirm the universality of the strategy. This study provides an efficient approach to achieve a highly stable red/NIR afterglow.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) are rapidly advancing to confront energy and environmental challenges, but the safety of SIBs has not received enough attention. The kinetic triplet model is constructed based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations to unveil a thermal decomposition kinetic mechanism of the P2‐type layered transition metal oxides before and after doping.








Abstract
The safety of the P2‐type layered transition metal oxides (P2‐NaxTMO2), a promising cathode material for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs), is a prerequisite for grid‐scale energy storage systems. However, previous thermal runaway studies mainly focused on morphological changes resulting from gas production detection and thermogravimetric analysis, while the structural transition and chemical reactions underlying these processes are still unclear. Herein, a comprehensive methodology to unveil an interplay mechanism among phase structures, interfacial microcrack, and thermal stability of the charged P2‐Na0.8Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) and the P2‐Na0.8Ni0.21Li0.12Mn0.67O2 (NNMO‐Li) at elevated temperatures is established. Combining a series of crystallographic and thermodynamic characterization techniques, the specific chemical reactions occurring in the NNMO materials during thermal runaway are clarified first and solidly proved that Li doping effectively hinders the dissolution of transition metal ions, reduces oxygen release, and enhances thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Importantly, based on Arrhenius and nonisothermal kinetic equations, the kinetic triplet model is successfully constructed to in‐depth elucidate the thermal decomposition reaction mechanism of P2‐NaxTMO2, demonstrating that such thermodynamic assessment provides a new perspective for building high‐safety SIBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A close‐to‐equilibrium crystallization method that enables the growth of large, high‐quality single crystals is proposed. This approach uses independent units for solute supply, crystal growth, and solute recycling, ensuring the system operates at an optimized, steady‐state growth point within the solubility phase diagram, maintaining consistent crystal growth even with varying perovskite growth window widths.









Abstract
The growth of large semiconductor crystals is crucial for advancing modern electronics and optoelectronics. While various crystal growth techniques have been developed for lead halide perovskites, a significant challenge remains: as crystal size increases, performance tends to deteriorate dramatically. This study addresses the inherent limitations of perovskite crystal growth by designing a novel strategy for near‐equilibrium growth system to maintain optimal conditions throughout the process. The system consists of three independent units: a solution supply unit, a crystal growth unit, and a solution recycling unit, which together ensure a constant solution concentration and temperature. By systematically optimizing temperature control and solution feeding rates, large and high‐quality FAPbBr3 single crystals, including a notable crystal measuring 51 × 45 × 10 mm3 are successfully produced. This crystal demonstrates a mobility‐lifetime product of 2.83 × 10⁻2 cm2 V⁻¹ and an ultralow detection limit of 319.22 pGyair, significantly surpassing existing perovskite crystals of similar size. The approach can serve as a universal platform for the controlled synthesis of all kinds of perovskite single crystals, laying the foundations for their use in various optoelectronic applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
NaGdF4@PDA‐ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) protect mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from ischemic stroke by neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chelating excess Ca2+. This dual action stabilizes Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, reduces oxidative stress, and prevents ROS‐Ca2+ overload cycles, enhancing MSC survival and functionality, and ultimately improving stroke therapy outcomes.









Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke. However, the survival of transplanted MSCs is often compromised by the excessive levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium ions (Ca2+) in the ischemic microenvironment following blood flow occlusion. In this study, a protective strategy is developed using functional nanomaterials to escort and shield MSCs. Specifically, NaGdF4@PDA‐ALD nanoparticles (NPANs) are synthesized, featuring a NaGdF4 core coated with polydopamine (PDA) for ROS scavenging and further modified with alendronate sodium (ALD) for Ca2+ chelation. The internalization of NPANs by MSCs protected them from oxidative damage and calcium overload, thereby promoting their viability and functionality. Furthermore, NaGdF4 generated T1 signal enhancement, enabling in vivo tracking of MSCs via magnetic resonance imaging. The NPANs‐treated MSCs demonstrated improved survival and migration to the ischemic region, promoting blood flow restoration and angiogenesis. These findings confirm the feasibility of employing functional nanoparticles to augment MSCs‐based therapies, offering a promising strategy to improve their therapeutic efficacy in ischemic stroke treatment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bioinspired by naturally oriented structures of biological tissues, it developed super‐robust conductive hydrogels with highly tunable mechanical property and anisotropic structure, and demonstrated, for the first time, the mechanical strength of the conductive hydrogels, used as flexible electrodes in triboelectric and piezoresistive device, affected both the accuracy and stability of machine learning‐assisted tactile perception.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels have attracted significant attention due to exceptional flexibility, electrochemical property, and biocompatibility. However, the low mechanical strength can compromise their stability under high stress, making the material susceptible to fracture in complex or harsh environments. Achieving a balance between conductivity and mechanical robustness remains a critical challenge. In this study, super‐robust conductive hydrogels were designed and developed with highly oriented structures and densified networks, by employing techniques such as stretch‐drying‐induced directional assembly, salting‐out, and ionic crosslinking. The hydrogels showed remarkable mechanical property (tensile strength: 17.13–142.1 MPa; toughness: 50 MJ m−3), high conductivity (30.1 S m−1), and reliable strain sensing performance. Additionally, it applied this hydrogel material to fabricate biomimetic electronic skin device, significantly improving signal quality and device stability. By integrating the device with 1D convolutional neural network algorithm, it further developed a real‐time material recognition system based on triboelectric and piezoresistive signal collection, achieving a classification accuracy of up to 99.79% across eight materials. This study predicted the potential of the high‐performance conductive hydrogels for various applications in flexible smart wearables, the Internet of Things, bioelectronics, and bionic robotics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new design strategy is introduced to eliminate mutual excitation in stacked scintillator detectors by rare earth ions doped quantum‐cutting scintillators with a significant absorption‐emission shift as the top layer. The developed detector features non‐overlapping optical absorption and RL emission spectra, improving the discrimination of materials with similar densities.








Abstract
Traditional energy‐integration X‐ray imaging systems rely on total X‐ray intensity for image contrast, ignoring energy‐specific information. Recently developed multilayer stacked scintillators have enabled multispectral, large‐area flat‐panel X‐ray imaging (FPXI), enhancing material discrimination capabilities. However, increased layering can lead to mutual excitation, which may affect the accurate discrimination of X‐ray energy. This issue is tackled by proposing a novel design strategy utilizing rare earth ions doped quantum‐cutting scintillators as the top layer. These scintillators create new luminescence centers via energy transfer, resulting in a significantly larger absorption‐emission shift, as well as the potential to double the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and enhance light output. To verify this concept, a three‐layer stacked scintillator detector is developed using ytterbium ions (Yb3+)‐doped CsPbCl3 perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) as the top layer, which offers a high PLQY of over 100% and a significant absorption‐emission shift of 570 nm. This configuration, CsAgCl2 and Cs3Cu2I5 as the middle and bottom layers, respectively, ensures non‐overlapping optical absorption and radioluminescence (RL) emission spectra. By calculating the optimal thickness for each layer to absorb specific X‐ray energies, the detector demonstrates distinct absorption differences across various energy bands, enhancing the identification of materials with similar densities.

Cycloolefin copolymers bearing hydroxyl, ester, and adamantanyl side groups are synthesized. Upon dispersing various phosphors into this polymer matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full‐color room temperature phosphorescence with lifetimes of 249–590 ms, showing no obvious luminescence quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments.








Abstract
Polymeric room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have been well developed and utilized in various fields. However, their fast thermo‐ and moisture‐quenching behavior highly limit their applications in certain harsh environments. Therefore, the preparation of materials with thermo‐ and moisture‐resistant phosphorescence is greatly attractive. Compared with common water‐soluble polymers, cycloolefin copolymers (COC) show outstanding hydrophobicity and higher rigidity, even at elevated temperatures, being as a promising candidate to prepare phosphorescence materials with suppressed thermo‐ and moisture‐quenching behavior. Herein, a type of COC bearing hydroxyl, ester, and adamantanyl side groups is synthesized. After dispersing various phosphors into this matrix, the resultant composites exhibit full‐color RTP with lifetimes of 249–590 ms. Their luminescence does not show obvious quenching in water, acid, alkalinous, reductive, and oxidative environments. In the presence of both rigid COC matrix and rigid phosphors, the corresponding composite displays high‐temperature phosphorescence performance. Even at 378 K, the composite can emit phosphorescence with a lifetime of 40–98 ms. The applications of these COC‐based composites for imaging, information encryption, and anti‐counterfeiting are thus explored.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A single‐peak stretchable BPLC laser is fabricated based on partially and fully crosslinked networks due to the slow variation of lattice orientation under small strains. The laser exhibits a tuning range of 44.429 nm at 32% strain, providing stable output over a broad‐ temperature range with 3D circularly polarized emission under small strains, presenting the potential applications in 3D mechanical perception.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers exhibit exceptional optical quality and tunability to external stimuli, holding significant promise for innovative developments in the field of flexible optoelectronics. However, there remain challenges for BPLC elastomer (BPLCE) lasers in maintaining good optical stability during stretching and varying temperature conditions. In this work, a stretchable laser is developed based on a well‐designed BPLCE with a combination of partially and fully crosslinked networks, which can output a single‐peak laser under small deformation (44.429 nm lasing shift at 32% strain) and a broad‐temperature range (from −20 to 100 °C). The superior performance can be attributed to the nonlinear 3D asymmetric deformation exhibited by the BPI lattice during stretching, particularly at low deformation rates below 40% strain, which effectively maintains the stability of the body‐centered cubic structure (with the maximum strain of this BPLCE up to 220%). Moreover, the BPLCE exhibits excellent thermal stability over a temperature range from −180 to 70 °C with a stopband shift of less than ±10 nm. As a proof‐of‐concept, the application of BPLCE laser for morphology sensing and 3D mechanical perception is demonstrated, which paves the way for potential applications of flexible optoelectronics.

<title>Coaxial Direct Ink Writing of Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomers in 3D Architectures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A low‐viscosity cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) ink and a silicone ink are prepared for coaxial direct ink writing of 3D strain sensors. The silicone shell supports the CLC core to enable layer‐by‐layer printing in addition to enhancing the mechanical properties of the core. Monostable and bistable thin‐shell domes are printed to demonstrate the 3D printing capabilities and mechanochromic behaviors.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) hold great promise for mechanochromic applications in anti‐counterfeiting, smart textiles, and soft robotics, thanks to the structural color and elasticity. While CLCEs are printed via direct ink writing (DIW) to fabricate free‐standing films, complex 3D structures are not fabricated due to the opposing rheological properties necessary for cholesteric alignment and multilayer stacking. Here, 3D CLCE structures are realized by utilizing coaxial DIW to print a CLC ink within a silicone ink. By tailoring the ink compositions, and thus, the rheological properties, the cholesteric phase rapidly forms without an annealing step, while the silicone shell provides encapsulation and support to the CLCE core, allowing for layer‐by‐layer printing of self‐supported 3D structures. As a demonstration, free‐standing bistable thin‐shell domes are printed. Color changes due to compressive and tensile stresses can be witnessed from the top and bottom of the inverted domes, respectively. When the domes are arranged in an array and inverted, they can snap back to their base state by uniaxial stretching, thereby functioning as mechanical sensors with memory. The additive manufacturing platform enables the rapid fabrication of 3D mechanochromic sensors thereby expanding the realm of potential applications for CLCEs.

Mn/Zn co‐doping in α‐Cu₂V₂O₇ induces local structure distortions, enhancing supercapacitor performance (Specific capacitance‐1950.95 Fg⁻¹; Energy density‐97.54 Whkg⁻¹) and cycling stability. Spin‐phonon coupling and superior magnetic properties enable thermo‐magnetic applications. A prototype device powers LED bulbs, demonstrating real‐world energy storage potential. This work integrates energy storage and spintronics, offering a transformative approach for advanced multifunctional materials.








Abstract
Supercapacitors are rapidly gaining attention as next‐generation energy storage devices due to their superior power and energy densities. This study pioneers the investigation of Mn/Zn co‐doping in α‐Cu₂V₂O₇ (CVO) to enhance its performance as a supercapacitor electrode material. Structural and local Structural properties of Mn/Zn co‐doped CVO have been investigated through X‐ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), X‐ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and X‐ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS), revealing significant distortions that enhance supercapacitor performance. The optimized sample demonstrates a remarkable specific capacitance of 1950.95 Fg−1, energy density of 97.54 Whkg−1, and enhanced capacitive retention, attributed to the unique Cu coordination environment and improved charge transfer kinetics. Temperature‐dependent Raman spectroscopy unveils spin‐phonon coupling (SPC), particularly in VO₄ stretching modes, supported by magnetic measurements that shows a reduction in the Néel temperature and the emergence of zero field‐cooled (ZFC) exchange bias (EB). This work is the first to report the impact of local structure distortion on both supercapacitor performance and SPC in CVO, offering a novel strategy for developing high‐performance energy storage materials with spintronics potential. In addition, the assembled symmetric optimized supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 93.32 Whkg−1 and excellent cycling stability. A prototype device incorporating the optimized CVO successfully powers eight commercial LED bulbs, demonstrating its practical application potential.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The anion solvation structure is regulated by constructing a high‐salt concentration microenvironment, which maintains highly oxidation‐resistant contact ion pairs and ion aggregation. The tailored solvation structure assists in the formation of robust electrode‐electrolyte interphase, restraining the electrolyte oxidation and solvent co‐intercalation at high voltage, which promotes the rate capability and cycling stability of SDIBs over 10 000 cycles.








Abstract
Sodium‐based rechargeable batteries are some of the most promising candidates for electric energy storage with abundant sodium reserves, particularly, sodium‐based dual‐ion batteries (SDIBs) perform advantages in high work voltage (≈5.0 V), high‐power density, and potentially low cost. However, irreversible electrolyte decomposition and co‐intercalation of solvent molecules at the electrode interface under a high charge state are blocking their development. Herein, a high‐salt concentration microenvironment is created and proposed by tailoring the solvation structures of charge carriers including both cations and anions, which maintains highly oxidation‐resistant contact ion pairs and ion aggregates and provides a high ion conductivity. The tailored solvation structure makes a great contribution to protecting the graphite cathode from electrolyte oxidation, solvent co‐intercalation, and structural degradation by constructing a robust cathode‐electrolyte interphase with standout electrochemical stability. Based on this, the SDIBs achieved an excellent high‐voltage cycling stability with 81% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles and the battery showed an improved rate performance with 97.4 mAh g−1 maintained at 100 C. It is identified that regulating anion solvation structure is responsible for the stable interface chemistry and enhanced reaction kinetics, which provides deep insight into the compatibility design between the electrolyte and specialized charge storage in electrodes.

Abstract
Room‐temperature operation or high‐operation temperature (HOT) is essential for mid‐wave infrared (MWIR) optoelectronics devices providing low‐cost and compact systems for numerous applications. Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have emerged as a rising candidate to enable photodetectors to operate at HOT or room temperature and develop the next‐generation infrared focal plane array (FPA) imagers.

This study analyzes the failure of wireless earbud batteries within their intended usage context. By examining degradations from the material to device level, it reveals that failure patterns are linked to device configuration and operating conditions. The interplay of battery materials, structural design, and microenvironmental factors like temperature gradients offer crucial insights for improving battery integration and reliability.








Abstract
Lithium‐ion batteries are indispensable power sources for a wide range of modern electronic devices. However, battery lifespan remains a critical limitation, directly affecting the sustainability and user experience. Conventional battery failure analysis in controlled lab settings may not capture the complex interactions and environmental factors encountered in real‐world, in‐device operating conditions. This study analyzes the failure of commercial wireless earbud batteries as a model system within their intended usage context. Through multiscale and multimodal characterizations, the degradations from the material level to the device level are correlated, elucidating a failure pattern that is closely tied to the specific device configuration and operating conditions. The findings indicate that the ultimate failure mode is determined by the interplay of battery materials, cell structural design, and the in‐device microenvironment, such as temperature gradients and their fluctuations. This holistic, in‐device perspective on environmental influences provides critical insights for battery integration design, enhancing the reliability of modern electronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To address the challenge of embedding multilayer graphs with minimal complexity and information loss, this study introduces a vertical m‐CBA (vm‐CBA) capable of directly mapping multilayer relationships. By accurately representing inter‐layer and intra‐layer connections in three dimensions, vm‐CBA outperforms conventional embeddings in link prediction and information scores while requiring fewer operations.








Abstract
Graph data structures effectively represent objects and their relationships, enabling the modeling of complex connections in various fields. Recent work demonstrate that metal at diagonal crossbar arrays (m‐CBA) can effectively represent planar graphs. However, they are unsuitable for representing multilayer graphs having multiple relationships across different layers. Using conventional software, embedding multilayer graphs in high‐dimensional Euclidean spaces introduces significant mathematical complexity and computational burden, often resulting in information loss. This study proposes a unique graph embedding (mapping) method utilizing a fabricated vertical m‐CBA (vm‐CBA), where a custom‐built measurement system thoroughly validated its functionality. This structure directly maps multilayer graphs into a 3D vm‐CBA, accurately representing inter‐layer and intra‐layer connections. The practical link prediction and information scores across various real‐world datasets demonstrated that vm‐CBA achieved enhanced accuracy compared to conventional embeddings, even with a significantly decreased number of operations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A class of ultrathin GdOX with a high dielectric constant and breakdown field strength is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated MoS2 transistor gated by monocrystalline dielectric exhibits an on/off current ratio exceeding 109 and a near‐Boltzmann‐limit SS, indicating their tangible applications in 2D electronics.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) dielectrics are extensively employed to enhance the performance of 2D electronic devices. However, current vdW dielectric materials still encounter challenges such as low dielectric constant (κ) and difficulties in synthesizing high‐quality single crystals. 2D rare‐earth oxyhalides (REOXs) with exceptional electrical properties present an opportunity for the exploration of novel high‐κ dielectrics. In this study, for the first time, the synthesis of a series of van der Waals layered gadolinium oxyhalides with thicknesses down to monolayer through a space‐confined vdW epitaxy approach and demonstrating their application as a single‐crystalline gate dielectric is reported. It exhibits a remarkable relative dielectric constant exceeding 17 and an impressive breakdown field strength of 13.5 MV cm−1. The 2D transistors directly gated by the REOXs layer exhibit enhanced electron mobility and a low interface trap density. An ultrahigh on/off current ratio of 109 and a near‐Boltzmann‐limit subthreshold swing is achieved. The superior dielectric properties, combined with the universality and scalability of the production method (e.g., millimeter‐scale films are achieved), demonstrate that 2D REOXs can serve as promising gate dielectrics for 2D electronics, thereby expanding the study of high‐κ vdW materials and potentially providing new opportunities for the development of low‐power electronic devices.

A scalable mechanochemical synthetic approach is reported to fabricate Type III PLs from solid precursors. Owing to the presence of multiple interfacial hydrogen and coordination bonds, these PLs not only maintain porosity and fluidity with high stability, enabling efficient CH4 purification by CO2 removal and sequestration, but also facilitate the catalytic conversion of stored CO2 into valuable products.









Abstract
Porous liquids (PLs) have emerged as a promising class of flow porous materials, offering distinctive benefits for sustainable separation processes coupled with catalytic transformations in the chemical industry. Despite their potential, challenges remain in the realms of synthesis complexity, stability, and the strategic engineering of separation and catalytic sites. In this study, a scalable mechanochemical synthetic approach is reported to fabricate Type III PLs from solid precursors with high stability. In these Type III PLs, ZIF‐8 nanocrystals are dispersed in the deep eutectic solvents formed by solid hydrogen‐bond donors and acceptors. Owing to the presence of multiple interfacial hydrogen and coordination bonds, these PLs not only maintain porosity and fluidity with high stability, enabling efficient CH4 purification by CO2 removal and sequestration, but also facilitate the catalytic conversion of stored CO2 into valuable products under ambient conditions. This strategy advances the green production of stable and well‐dispersed PLs, showing the potential of PLs in the sustainable separation and catalysis coupling system in the chemical industry.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A Tg (glass transition temperature) regulation (TR) strategy is developed to effectively release residual strain in the perovskite film through adjusting the ratio of monomeric additives. The resulting film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and superior stability. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve a high efficiency of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%) and excellent stability.








Abstract
Thermally induced tensile strain that remains in perovskite films after annealing is one of the key reasons for diminishing the performance and operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a glass transition temperature (Tg) regulation (TR) strategy is developed by introducing two polymerizable monomers, 2‐(N‐3‐Sulfopropyl‐N,N‐dimethyl ammonium)ethyl methacrylate (SBMA) and 2‐Hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), into the perovskite layer. SBMA and HEA undergo in situ polymerization, which regulates the nucleation and crystal growth of the perovskite film. In addition, adjusting the ratio of SBMA and HEA to lower the Tg of the resulting polymer effectively releases the strain in the perovskite film. The modified film exhibits significantly reduced tensile strain, decreased trap density and improved stability. As a result, the optimized PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.15% (certified as 25.59%). Furthermore, the encapsulated device demonstrates prominent enhanced operation stability, maintaining 90.3% of its initial efficiency after 500 h of continuous sunlight exposure.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Dip coating is employed to fabricate large‐area organic solar cells. By controlling the fluid characteristics, the correlation among Van der Waals forces in precursor film, aggregation state of polymer, and fibrous orientation in active layer is revealed. Consequently, the dip‐coated 1.0 cm2 rigid and 10.0 cm2 flexible cells exhibit the efficiencies of 17.9% and 13.7%, respectively.








Abstract
As a classical low‐cost technique, dip coating has not been used for printable electronics. Here, the study demonstrates large‐area organic solar cells can be made by dip coating. The correlation is revealed among Van der Waals forces in precursor film, aggregation state of polymer, and fibrous orientation in active layer; the relationship is also expounded between fluid mechanics of the confined liquid in polymer scaffold and the continuity of the acceptor phase. By controlling the fluid characteristics, the ideal nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network forms. As a result, the 1.0 cm2 rigid and 10.0 cm2 flexible cells exhibit efficiencies of 17.9% and 13.7%, respectively. Moreover, the method for predicting the optimal coating speed for the dip coating of given inks is proposed. Overall, this work not only demonstrates the superiority of dip coating for organic solar cell fabrication but also provides guidance for its application in printable electronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Antiferromagnetic dynamics in nanometer‐thick LaFeO₃ films is unveiled using time‐resolved Kerr effect, demonstrating ultra‐low damping and spin‐orbit torque manipulation. This study provides an experimental validation of theoretical predictions, offering new insights into nanoscale spintronic systems. The exceptional material quality enables precise probing of dynamics, bridging the gap between antiferromagnetic materials and practical applications in ultrafast spintronics.








Abstract
In the burgeoning field of spintronics, antiferromagnetic materials (AFMs) are attracting significant attention for their potential to enable ultra‐fast, energy‐efficient devices. Thin films of AFMs are particularly promising for practical applications due to their compatibility with spin‐orbit torque (SOT) mechanisms. However, studying these thin films presents challenges, primarily due to the weak signals they produce and the rapid dynamics driven by SOT, that are too fast for conventional electric transport or microwave techniques to capture. The time‐resolved magneto‐optical Kerr effect (TR‐MOKE) has been a successful tool for probing antiferromagnetic dynamics in bulk materials, thanks to its sub‐picosecond (sub‐ps) time resolution. Yet, its application to nanometer‐scale thin films has been limited by the difficulty of detecting weak signals in such small volumes. In this study, the first successful observation of antiferromagnetic dynamics are presented in nanometer‐thick orthoferrite films using the pump‐probe technique to detect TR‐MOKE signal. This paper report an exceptionally low damping constant of 1.5 × 10−4 and confirms the AFM magnonic nature of these dynamics through angular‐dependent measurements. Furthermore, it is observed that electrical currents can potentially modulate these dynamics via SOT. The findings lay the groundwork for developing tunable, energy‐efficient spintronic devices, paving the way for advancements in next‐generation spintronic applications.

<title>Dimensional Regulation of Organic n‐Type Dopants for Highly Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A dimensional regulation strategy of organic dopants is developed to fabricate high‐performance inverted perovskite solar cells. Selenium has a strong electron‐donating ability, which can transfer electrons to perovskites. Specially, 2D‐perylene diimide can coat the perovskite crystal to form a lattice cage through their conjugate skeletons, which passivates the trap states, improves the n‐doping efficiency, and restrains ion migration.








Abstract
A strong n‐type perovskite layer is crucial in achieving high open‐circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the p‐i‐n solar cells, as the weak n‐type perovskites result in a loss of VOC, and the p‐type perovskites contain numerous electron traps that cause the severe carrier recombination. Here, three types of perylene diimide (PDI) based small molecule dopants with different dimensions, including 1D‐PDI, 2D‐PDI, and 3D‐PDI are designed, to produce heavier n‐type perovskites. The PDI‐based molecules with Selenium atoms have a strong electron‐donating ability, effectively enlarging the quasi‐Fermi level splitting within the perovskites. Besides, the PDI molecules can coat the surface of the perovskite crystal to form the lattice cage through their conjugate skeletons, which passivates the trap states and improves the n‐doping efficiency, as well as the stabilities of perovskites and related devices. With the addition of the 2D‐PDI, the small‐area solar cells achieved a PCE of 26.06% (25.44% certified) with a high VOC of 1.18 V and a remarkable fill factor of 87.23%. Furthermore, the rigid and flexible perovskite solar modules yielded high PCEs of 21.48% and 20.71%, respectively. This dimensional regulation strategy provides useful guidance for effective n‐type doping and high‐performance p‐i‐n solar cells.

<title>High Entropy Fine‐Tuning Achieves Fast Li+ Kinetics in High‐Performance Co‐Free High‐Ni Layered Cathodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work provides an efficient and versatile high‐entropy doping strategy. The synergistic effect between high‐entropy dopant elements is optimized by compositional fine‐tuning to overcome the kinetic hysteresis and high reactivity problems that have hindered the development of Co‐free Ni‐rich cathode materials. Excellent long‐cycle stability under fast charging and discharging conditions is achieved.








Abstract
Co‐free high‐Ni layered cathode materials LiNixMeyO2 (Me = Mn, Mg, Al, etc.) are a key part of the next‐generation high‐energy lithium‐ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high specific capacity and low cost. However, the hindered Li+ kinetics and the high reactivity of Ni4+ result in poor rate performance and unsatisfied cycling stability. This work designs a promising strategy for designing a high‐performance high‐entropy doping Co‐free high‐Ni layered cathode LiNi0.9Mn0.03Mg0.02Ta0.02Mo0.02Na0.01O2 (HE‐Ni90‐1.557) by elemental screening and compositional fine‐tuning. Compositional fine‐tuning optimizes the synergistic relationship between the high‐entropy dopant elements, thereby significantly suppresses the kinetic hysteresis induced by Li+/Ni2+ mixing. The pillar effect significantly enhances the diffusion kinetics of Li+ at the high state of charge (SOC). Meanwhile, the high‐entropy fine‐tuning significantly postpones the H2‐H3 phase transition and reduces the dissolution of transition metals and the loss of lattice oxygen in the cathodes. Consequently, the diffusion kinetics of Li+ at the atomic and electrode particle scales are significantly enhanced. The HE‐Ni90‐1.557 cathode exhibits an initial capacity of 225.1 mAh g−1 at 0.2 C and a full cell with a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 1500 cycles at 3C. This work provides a promising avenue for commercializing Co‐free high‐Ni cathodes for next‐generation LIBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A spherical core‐shell nanomotor consisting of a polydopamine‐indocyanine green composite shell and a rigid functional core is proposed in this work. This motor can be activated by the NIR‐I irradiation to perform NIR‐II imaging‐directed thermoplastic propulsion in subcutaneous tissue, enabling an efficient peritumoral administration for low‐risk superficial tumor photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Peritumoral subcutaneous injection has been highly envisioned as an efficient yet low‐risk administration of photothermal agents for superficial tumor photothermal therapy. However, obstructed by complex subcutaneous tissue, the delivery of injected photothermal agents to the specific tumor remains a critical issue. Herein, the study reports a polydopamine (PDA)‐encapsulated spherical core/shell nanomotor with fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) immobilized on its PDA shell. Upon the first near‐infrared (NIR‐I) irradiation, this motor can generate favorable photothermal heat, and meantime, emit a robust ICG fluorescence in the second near‐infrared window (NIR‐II). The heat turns the motor into an active photothermal agent able to perform thermophoretic propulsion along the irradiation direction in subcutaneous tissue, while the ICG fluorescence can direct the subcutaneous propulsion of motors toward specific tumor through real‐time NIR‐II imaging. These functions endow the motor with the ability of moving to tumor after being injected at peritumoral site, enabling an enhanced photothermal therapy (PTT). The results demonstrated herein suggest an integrated nanorobotic tool for the superficial PTT using peritumoral administration, highlighting an NIR‐II imaging‐directed subcutaneous propulsion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A high‐performance Pt/CuO@CF catalyst is designed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass‐derived HMF at high concentrations with excellent recyclability. Experimental results and theoretical simulations reveal that Pt modification enhances interfacial active sites, strengthens Pt‐CuO coupling, induces charge redistribution, and adjusts the d‐band structure. These changes effectively improve the adsorption of reactants and hydroxyl groups, contributing to the highly efficient HMFOR.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidation of biomass‐derived 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an environmentally friendly route for producing the sustainable polymer monomer 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Thus, precisely adjusting the synergistic adsorption among key reactive species, such as HMF and OHads, on the carefully designed catalyst surface is essential for achieving satisfactory catalytic performance for HMF oxidation to FDCA as it is closely related to the adsorption strength and configuration of the reaction substrates. This kind of regulation will ultimately facilitate the improvement of HMF oxidation performance. In this work, Pt nanoparticles modified CuO nanowires (denoted as Pt/CuO@CF) are constructed for the selective electrooxidation of HMF to FDCA under alkaline conditions. The well‐designed Pt/CuO@CF demonstrates highly impressive catalytic performance across a range of HMF concentrations, ranging from the commonly used concentrations to higher levels typically not explored (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mm) with high FEFDCA (all above 95%) and outstanding long‐term stability (15 cycles). In situ experimental characterizations confirm that the designed heterogeneous interface between Pt and CuO enhances the enrichment of HMF and OHads species on the catalyst surface. Theoretical calculations reveal the anchored Pt nanoparticles reduce the adsorption barrier for HMF and OHads, thereby promoting the highly selective oxidation of HMF to FDCA.

Angstrom‐confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) CoMn dual single atoms within the carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate for water purification. The angstrom‐confined strategy leads to the adaptive change of atomic spin state, and reduces the energy barrier for *SO5 formation and *O2 desorption during singlet oxygen generation, enabling a 38.6‐fold increase in singlet oxygen production compared to the surface unconfined one.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in the transformation from peroxymonosulfate to singlet oxygen, adaptive tuning of atomic spin state as the peroxymonosulfate structure varied is crucial. The angstrom confinement can effectively tune spin state, but developing an adaptive angstrom‐confined atomic system is challenging. Angstrom‐confined cobalt (Co) manganese (Mn) dual single atoms within flexible 2D carbon nitride interlayer are constructed to drive adaptive tuning of spin state by changing atomic coordination under angstrom confinement. The in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations showed that medium‐spin Co in Co─N4 absorbed electrons after the adsorption of peroxymonosulfate on CoMn dual single‐atom sites and then cleaved O─H of peroxymonosulfate to facilitate *SO5 generation, while the introduction of *SO5 increased interlayer distance and then cleaved Co─N and Mn─N, resulting in the spin state transition from medium to high. Subsequently, the high‐spin Co and Mn in Co─N2 and Mn─N2 desorbed the *O2 from *SO5, restoring the initial medium spin state. The adaptive spin state transition enhanced 38.6‐fold singlet oxygen yield compared to the unconfined control. The proposed angstrom‐confined diatomic strategy is applicable to serial diatomic catalysts, providing an efficient and universal design scheme for singlet oxygen‐mediated selective wastewater treatment technology at the atomic level.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The challenges of constructing heterogeneous catalysts with high metal loading, precise structures, and stability are overcome by proposing a stepwise targeted coordination engineering strategy. This approach allows for the co‐anchoring of Pt single atoms and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters on g‐C3N4 and the resulting dual‐site catalysts demonstrate remarkable electrochemical reduction capabilities and enhanced stability throughout the catalytic process.








Abstract
Dual‐site catalysts hold significant promise for accelerating complex electrochemical reactions, but a major challenge remains in balancing high loading with precise dual‐site architecture to achieve optimal activity, stability, and specificity simultaneously. Herein, a strategy of stepwise targeted coordination engineering is introduced to co‐anchor Pt single atoms (Pt1, 1.41 wt.%) and Au25(SG)18 nanoclusters (Au25, 18.92 wt.%) with high loadings on graphitic carbon nitride (g‐C3N4). This approach ensures that Pt1 and Au25 occupy distinct surface sites on the g‐C3N4 substrate, providing excellent stability and unprecedented electrochemical activity. In the catalysis of As(III), a sensitivity of 8.32 µA ppb−1 is achieved, more than double the previously reported values under neutral conditions. The enhanced detection limit (0.2 ppb) is crucial for monitoring water quality and protecting public health from arsenic contamination, a significant environmental and health risk. Furthermore, the formation of Pt─As and As─S bonds facilitates the easier breakage of As─O bonds, thereby lowering the reaction barrier energy of the rate‐determining step and significantly enhancing arsenious acid catalysis efficiency. These results not only offer an intriguing strategy for constructing highly efficient heterogeneous dual‐site catalysts but also reveal the atomic‐scale catalytic mechanisms that drive enhanced catalytic efficiency.

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202417906?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The first Mn‐based magnetoplumbites, ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb), are discovered, synthesized, and characterized. According to magnetic properties measurements, neutron diffraction, and reverse Monte Carlo refinement, short‐range magnetic correlations are observed in the new materials. These observations reveal 2D magnetic correlations and magnetic frustration in ASb3Mn9O19, making it a promising platform for inducing exotic quantum states.








Abstract
Magnetoplumbites are one of the most broadly studied families of hexagonal ferrites, typically with high magnetic ordering temperatures, making them excellent candidates for permanent magnets. However, magnetic frustration is rarely observed in magnetoplumbites. Herein, the discovery, synthesis, and characterization of the first Mn‐based magnetoplumbite, as well as the first magnetoplumbite involving pnictogens (Sb), ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb) are reported. The Mn3+ (S = 2) cations, further confirmed by DC magnetic susceptibility and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, construct three geometrically frustrated sublattices, including Kagome, triangular, and puckered honeycomb lattices. Magnetic properties measurements revealed strong antiferromagnetic spin–spin coupling as well as multiple low‐temperature magnetic features. Heat capacity data does not show any prominent λ‐anomaly, suggesting minimal associated magnetic entropy. Moreover, neutron powder diffraction (NPD) implied the absence of long‐range magnetic ordering in KSb3Mn9O19 down to 3 K. However, several magnetic peaks are observed in RbSb3Mn9O19 at 3 K, corresponding to an incommensurate magnetic structure. Interestingly, strong diffuse scattering is seen in the NPD patterns of both compounds at low angles and is analyzed by reverse Monte Carlo refinements, indicating short‐range spin ordering related to frustrated magnetism as well as 2D magnetic correlations in ASb3Mn9O19 (A = K or Rb).

<title>A Bifunctional Lysosome‐Targeting Chimera Nanoplatform for Tumor‐Selective Protein Degradation and Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202417942?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A bifunctional lysosome‐targeting chimera nanoplatform (NLTC) is synthesized for tumor‐selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling surface properties and encapsulating catalase, NLTC can efficiently accumulate at tumor tissues and avoid on‐target off‐tumor toxicity, synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1) and relieve immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Lysosome‐targeting chimeras (LYTACs) have recently emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for degrading extracellular and membrane‐associated pathogenic proteins by hijacking lysosome‐targeting receptors. However, the antitumor performance of LYTAC is limited by its insufficient tumor accumulation and nonspecific activation. Additionally, the synergistic effects of LYTACs and other therapeutic modalities are crucial. To address these issues, a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform (NLTC) is developed for tumor‐selective protein degradation and enhanced cancer immunotherapy. By rationally controlling the surface composition, the NLTC can effectively transport extracellular or membrane proteins into lysosomes for degradation via cation‐independent mannose 6‐phosphate receptors. With removable surface modification, an NLTC is obtained that efficiently accumulated in tumor tissues and avoided on‐target off‐tumor toxicity. Moreover, the synthesis method of NLTC is generally applicable to various enzymes. Thus, catalase (CAT) is encapsulated with NLTC to synergistically degrade cancer cell surface programmed death ligand‐1 (PD‐L1), relieve the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment for effective cancer immunotherapy, and significantly inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis in B16F10‐bearing mice. This work presents a bifunctional LYTAC nanoplatform that can not only perform tissue‐selective protein degradation but also integrate other therapeutic modalities, providing insights into the design of advanced LYTAC technologies for clinical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A ZrO2‐SiO2 fiber aerogel with a supercontinuous nanolayer is developed for high‐temperature thermal insulation. The supercontinuous arrangement of ultra‐fine ZrO2 grains on the aerogel surface enables close connections between grains and fibers, promoting efficient transmission of mechanical and thermal stresses, which contributes to record‐high specific strength and remarkable thermal‐insulating behaviors.








Abstract
Breaking the thermal, mechanical and lightweight performance limit of aerogels has pivotal significance on thermal protection, new energy utilization, high‐temperature catalysis, structural engineering, and physics, but is severely limited by the serious discrete characteristics between grain boundary and nano‐units interfaces. Herein, a thermodynamically driven surface reaction and confined crystallization process is reported to synthesize a centimeter‐scale supercontinuous ZrO2 nanolayer on ZrO2‐SiO2 fiber aerogel surface, which significantly improved its thermal and mechanical properties with density almost unchanged (≈26 mg cm−3). Systematic structure analysis confirms that the supercontinuous layer achieves a close connection between grains and fibers through Zr─O─Si bonds. The as‐prepared aerogel exhibits record‐breaking specific strength (≈84615 N m kg−1, can support up to ≈227 272 times aerogel mass) and dynamic impact resistance (withstanding impacts up to 500 times aerogel mass and up to 200 cycling stability at 80% strain). Besides, its temperature resistance has also been greatly optimized (400 °C enhancement, stability at 1500 °C). This work will provide a new perspective for exploring the limits of lightweight, high strength, and thermal properties of solid materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A particle‐polymer coalescence strategy is proposed to build balanced particle cohesion, successfully realizing the bending, knotting, coiling, winding, and interlacing of cement slurry for weaving. Beyond the state‐of‐the‐art formwork casting, grouting, and 3D‐printing, this cement weaving technology may invoke the construction technology revolution and new material and structure design.








Abstract
Weaving, a pivotal technique in human construction activities since the Neolithic era, remains unattainable in modern concrete construction. Here, a novel particle‐polymer coalescence strategy is proposed, which involves electrostatic, bridging, coordinating, and hydrogen bonding interactions, to establish balanced particle cohesion, enabling the fabrication of stretchable cement slurry. The bending, knotting, coiling, winding, and interlacing of cement filaments for structural textiles is successfully realized beyond traditional formwork casting, grouting, and 3D‐printing, and fabricate the first‐ever Chinese knot woven with cement. Weaving construction builds a triaxially cross‐penetrating structure that greatly promotes interlayer strength and toughness by ≈208.5% and 676.5% compared to the state‐of‐the‐art layer‐by‐layer 3D printed structure. These findings not only make a breakthrough in concrete construction technology but also provide solutions for fabricating multi‐directional woven structures with great engineering‐application potentials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A liposome‐based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes and carbon nanotubes are embedded in the artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular probe transduction and mass transfer. The strategy accelerates cell‐cell signal probe transmission and enables effective sensing of let‐7a and visualizing let‐7a in living colon cancer cells.








Abstract
Monitoring intracellular biomarkers is crucial for clinical disease diagnosis. However, the majority of signaling molecules face difficulties in slow transference across the cell membrane to reach intracellular detection sites, limiting their application in clinical settings. This study proposes an artificial cell‐based signal probe transfer‐enhanced sensing strategy to effectively detect microRNAs (miRNAs) by embedding carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in artificial cell membranes. The liposome‐based artificial cell is constructed to protect the signal probes such as nucleic acids, metal ions, and fluorescent dyes. CNTs are embedded in artificial cell membranes and employed as artificial channels to enhance intercellular signal probe transduction and mass transfer. Through CNTs‐mediate cell‐cell signal probe transmission, the probes pass through the liposome membrane interface and fuse into target cells, selectively hybridizing with the intracellular target miRNAs, triggering a sensing process and resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to prove the enhancement of CNTs‐mediated cell‐cell fusion. This strategy demonstrates excellent analytical performance by quantitatively detecting let‐7a miRNA and visualizing it in living colon cancer cells. These findings hold great significance in promoting and accelerating cell‐cell signal probe transmission and enabling effective sensing of intracellular biomarkers for diagnostic purposes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents the first synthesis of 2D hexagonal Eu₂SO₂ and tetragonal Eu₂SO₆ with tunable dielectric properties. Eu₂SO₂ offers high dielectric performance, while Eu₂SO₆ provides a wider bandgap. Integrated into MoS₂ field‐effect transistors, these materials demonstrate excellent performance, highlighting their potential as multifunctional dielectrics for next‐generation low‐power electronics.








Abstract
Advancing next‐generation electronics necessitates precise control of dielectric properties in 2D materials. Here, the first synthesis of novel 2D quasi‐van der Waals (vdW) europium oxysulfur (Eu2SOx) compounds, comprising hexagonal Eu₂SO₂ and tetragonal Eu₂SO₆ phases, with composition‐tunable dielectric properties, is presented. Using a homodiffusive‐controlled epitaxial growth method, materials are achieved with complementary characteristics: the hexagonal Eu₂SO₂ phase exhibits a high dielectric constant (≈30) paired with a moderate bandgap (≈4.56 eV), while the tetragonal Eu₂SO₆ phase offers a wider bandgap (≈5.62 eV) but a lower dielectric constant (≈20). The potential of these materials is demonstrated by integrating ultrathin Eu₂SO₂ nanoplates with molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) field‐effect transistors (FETs) via vdW forces. The resulting devices achieve a near‐ideal Ion/Ioff ratio (≈10⁸), minimal hysteresis (≈5.3 mV), a low subthreshold slope (≈63.5 mV dec⁻¹), and ultralow leakage current (≈10⁻¹⁴ A). These results highlight the capacity of europium oxysulfur compounds to address the trade‐off between dielectric constant and bandgap, offering tailored solutions for diverse 2D electronic applications. This work underscores the potential of composition engineering to expand the family of rare‐earth oxysulfur compounds for nanoelectronics, paving the way for innovative gate dielectrics in next‐generation devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Nonlinear ion dynamics in electrochemical ionic synapses enable spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP) with low energy consumption and minimal variability. The approach supports diverse STDP forms and flexible learning rules across timescales from milliseconds to nanoseconds, enabling spiking neural network hardware with high throughput and adaptability while maintaining low energy consumption and high reliability.








Abstract
Programmable synaptic devices that can achieve timing‐dependent weight updates are key components to implementing energy‐efficient spiking neural networks (SNNs). Electrochemical ionic synapses (EIS) enable the programming of weight updates with very low energy consumption and low variability. Here, the strongly nonlinear kinetics of EIS, arising from nonlinear dynamics of ions and charge transfer reactions in solids, are leveraged to implement various forms of spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP). In particular, protons are used as the working ion. Different forms of the STDP function are deterministically predicted and emulated by a linear superposition of appropriately designed pre‐ and post‐synaptic neuron signals. Heterogeneous STDP is also demonstrated within the array to capture different learning rules in the same system. STDP timescales are controllable, ranging from milliseconds to nanoseconds. The STDP resulting from EIS has lower variability than other hardware STDP implementations, due to the deterministic and uniform insertion of charge in the tunable channel material. The results indicate that the ion and charge transfer dynamics in EIS can enable bio‐plausible synapses for SNN hardware with high energy efficiency, reliability, and throughput.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces a continuous‐flow flame spray pyrolysis method for tuning lattice strain in high‐entropy‐oxide nanoparticles. By varying the cooling rates of quenching, tensile strain increases by 2.75%, enhancing oxygen evolution reaction performance with a 25 mV reduction in overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. This approach facilitates efficient mass production and precise control of lattice strain.








Abstract
The lattice‐strain engineering of high‐entropy‐oxide nanoparticles (HEO‐NPs) is considered an effective strategy for achieving outstanding performance in various applications. However, lattice‐strain engineering independent of the composition variation still confronts significant challenges, with existing modulation techniques difficult to achieve mass production. Herein, a novel continuous‐flow synthesis strategy by flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) is proposed, which air varying flow rates is introduced for fast quenching to alter the cooling rate and control the lattice strain of HEO‐NPs. Experimental results demonstrate that as the flow rate of air increases from 0 L to 24 L min−1, the cooling rate has increased by more than ten times, and the tensile strain of the HEO‐NPs increases by 2.75%. Utilizing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity as an indicator, it is observed that the overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 is reduced by 25 mV. Importantly, this approach enables the simple and efficient regulation of lattice strain in HEO‐NPs (110 mg min−1). Thus, this study provides a new approach for both the mass production and regulation of lattice strain in HEO‐NPs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Mimicking micro‐pores structures from black butterflies, terahertz response behaviors with incidence‐angle‐insensitive and ultra‐broadband can be effectively controlled through a disordered pore‐induced structural orientation mechanism. In this research, the first investigation is presented into the regulation of terahertz response behaviors via optimized pore structure including disorder, pore parameters, and orientation, regarding as resonance sphere and waveguide system.








Abstract
The structural disorder of the black butterfly assists in capturing sunlight across a wider spectral and angular range, injecting infinite vitality for omnidirectional and stimuli‐responsive wave‐absorbing materials. Here, the disordered micro‐pores responding to terahertz (THz) waves through electromagnetic simulations, and then prepared via ice templating technology are analyzed and optimized. The customized disordered aerogel makes possible perfect terahertz response property with incidence‐angle‐insensitive and ultra‐broadband. Ti3C2Tx MXene/carboxymethyl cellulose aerogels realize excellent shielding effectiveness exceeding 70.32 dB and reflection loss of more than 43.02 dB over the frequency range of 0.3–1.5 THz. Tailoring the structural orientation of anisotropic aerogels functions as a versatile dynamic modulation approach along terahertz propagation direction. The porous structure with moderate conductivity gradually triggers the resonance effect of the cavity, approximating a resonance sphere (pore) and waveguide system (tube). Ultimately, gradient impedance aerogel is proposed integrating THz‐infrared stealth, hydrophobicity, and mechanical strength. This inspired biomimetic structural strategy will also enable various terahertz applications such as terahertz imaging, line‐of‐sight telecommunication, information encryption, and space exploration.

<title>Cation‐Vacancy Engineering in Cobalt Selenide Boosts Electrocatalytic Upcycling of Polyester Thermoplastics at Industrial‐Level Current Density</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Cation vacancies‐vacancies‐rich cobalt selenide as electrocatalyst to convert polybutylene terephthalate into succinic acid is crafted, which functions well at industrial‐level current density (1.5 A cm−2 @1.477 V vs. RHE). The catalytic mechanism of catalyst and related generality of electrocatalytic upcycling of other polyester thermoplastics are investigated. This work contributes to propel current research frontier of utilization of low‐value carbon resources.








Abstract
The past decades have witnessed the increasing accumulation of plastics, posing a daunting environmental crisis. Among various solutions, converting plastics into value‐added products presents a significant endeavor. Here, an electrocatalytic upcycling route that efficiently converts waste poly(butylene terephthalate) plastics into high‐value succinic acid with high Faradaic efficiency of 94.0% over cation vacancies‐rich cobalt selenide catalyst is reported, showcasing unprecedented activity (1.477 V vs. RHE) to achieve an industrial‐level current density of 1.5 A cm−2, and featuring a robust operating durability (≈170 h). In particular, when combining butane‐1,4‐diol monomer oxidation (BOR) with hydrogen evolution using the cation vacancy‐engineered cobalt selenide as bifunctional catalyst, a relatively low cell voltage of 1.681 V is required to reach 400 mA cm−2, manifesting an energy‐saving efficiency of ≈15% compared to pure water splitting. The mechanism and reaction pathways of BOR over the vacancies‐rich catalyst are first revealed through theoretical calculations and in‐situ spectroscopic investigations. The generality of this catalyst is evidenced by its powerful electrocatalytic activity to other polyester thermoplastics such as poly(butylene succinate) and poly(ethylene terephthalate). These electrocatalytic upcycling strategies can be coupled with the reduction of small molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2, and NO3−), shedding light on energy‐saving production of value‐added chemicals.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The modification of SU5402 (SU) with aliphatic chains containing 20 carbon atoms (SU‐C20 NPs) exhibits an exceptional ability to penetrate the ocular barrier and ensure prolonged drug retention within the eye. These optimized prodrug nanoparticles show a remarkable therapeutic effect in choroidal neovascularization (CNV), resulting in minimal hyperfluorescent leakage and the smallest CNV lesion thickness.








Abstract
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a prevalent cause of vision impairment. The primary treatment for CNV involves intravitreal injections of anti‐vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. Nevertheless, this approach still faces numerous limitations like poor patient compliance, high therapy expenditure and lack of response in some individuals. Herein, a series of anti‐neovascularization prodrugs, SU5402 (SU), modified with lipids of varying chain lengths (C12, C16, C20, C24, C28) is synthesized (SU‐C12, SU‐C16, SU‐C20, SU‐C24, SU‐C28). 1% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is used as a stabilizer to create nanoformulations of five prodrugs named SU‐C12 NPs, SU‐C16 NPs, SU‐C20 NPs, SU‐C24 NPs, SU‐C28 NPs. Among these, SU‐C20 NPs significantly prolong the retention of bioactive drug in the eye for up to 70 d. Moreover, SU‐C20 NPs demonstrate superior tissue permeability via enhanced cellular endocytosis and exocytosis. With its prolonged retention and improved penetration, SU‐C20 NPs reduce the fluorescence intensity of fundus leakage by 42.5% and the fluorescence area by 51.5% in CNV mice after four weeks, effectively inhibiting the progression of CNV. Altogether, small molecule drug SU is innovatively modified to improve its effectiveness for treating fundus neovascular diseases, proposing an alternative therapy for wet age‐related macular degeneration (wAMD).

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Intra‐particle pores play a practical role in cutting down the electrolyte quantity needed during wetting. A high pore‐throat ratio empowers Li‐rich layered oxides to withstand lean electrolyte conditions at 1.4 g Ah−1 and achieve a specific energy of 600 Wh kg−1 in a pouch cell. This accomplishment charts a course for pore‐based regulation in high‐energy storage devices.








Abstract
Reducing excess electrolytes offers a promising approach to improve the specific energy of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, using lean electrolytes presents a significant challenge for porous electrode materials due to heterogeneous wetting. The spontaneous wetting of nano‐ or meso‐pores within particles, though seldom discussed, adversely affects wetting under lean electrolyte conditions. Herein, this undesired wetting behavior is mitigated by enlarging the pore‐throat ratio, enabling Li‐rich layered oxide to function effectively at very low electrolyte/capacity (E/C) ratio of 1.4 g Ah−1. The resulting pouch cell achieves 606 Wh kg−1 and retains 80% capacity (75% energy) after 70 cycles. Through imaging techniques and molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that the pore‐throat ratio effectively determines the permeability of electrolyte within particles. By elucidating pore‐relating mechanisms, this work unveils promising potential of manipulating pore structures in porous electrode materials, an approach that can be applied to improve the specific energy of other devices including semi‐solid‐state lithium batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An innovative ultralight electrospun nanofiber composite filter, mass‐produced via an one‐step free surface electrospinning technology, is engineered with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure, featuring elongated internal aperture channels. This advanced TSN filter excels in high‐performance filtration of ultrafine PM0.3 aerosols, while significantly minimizing material usage. It is designed for recyclability and operates with low energy requirements, ensuring both wearer comfort and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
Air pollutants, particularly highly permeable particulate matter (PM), threaten public health and environmental sustainability due to extensive filter media consumption. Existing melt‐blown nonwoven filters struggle with PM0.3 removal, energy consumption, and disposal burdens. Here, an ultralight composite filter with a vertical ternary spatial network (TSN) structure that saves ≈98% of raw material usage and reduces fabrication time by 99.4%, while simultaneously achieving high‐efficiency PM0.3 removal (≥99.92%), eco‐friendly regeneration (near‐zero energy consumption), and enhanced wearing comfort (breathability >80 mm s⁻¹, infrared transmittance >85%), is reported. The TSN filter consists of a hybrid layer of microspheres (average diameter ≈1 µm)/superfine nanofibers (≈20 nm) sandwiched between two nanofiber scaffolds (diameter ≈400 nm and ≈100 nm). This arrangement offers high porosity (≈85%), ultralow areal density (<1 g m−2), alow airflow resistance (<90 Pa), guaranteeing superb thermal comfort. Notably, utilizing scalable one‐step free surface electrospinning technology, TSN mats can be mass‐produced at a rate of 60 meters per hour (width of 1.6 meters), which is critical and verified for various applications including window screens, individual respiratory protectors, and dust collectors. This work provides a viable strategy for designing high‐performance nanofiber filter media through structural regulation in a scalable, cost‐effective, and sustainable way.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Aluminum glycinate‐based organometallic molecule is used to tailor buried interface and minimize interface‐driven energy loss, which realizes high efficiencies of 26.74% and 20.71% for 1.55 and 1.785 eV bandgap perovskite solar cells, respectively.








Abstract
Rational regulation of Me‐4PACz/perovskite interface has emerged as a significant challenge in the pursuit of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, an organometallic molecule of aluminum glycinate (AG) that contained amine (‐NH2) and aluminum hydroxyl (Al‐OH) groups is developed to tailor the buried interface and minimize interface‐driven energy losses. The Al‐OH groups selectively bonded with unanchored O═P‐OH and bare NiO‐OH to optimize the surface morphology and energy levels, while the ‐NH2 group interacted specifically with Pb2+ to retard perovskite crystallization, passivate buried Pb‐related defects, and release residual interface stress. These interactions facilitate the interface carrier extraction and reduce interface‐driven energy losses, thereby realizing a balanced charge carrier transport. Consequently, AG‐modified narrow bandgap (1.55 eV) PSC demonstrates an efficiency of 26.74% (certified 26.21%) with a fill factor of 86.65%; AG‐modified wide bandgap (1.785 eV) PSC realizes 20.71% champion efficiency with excellent repeatability. These PSCs maintain 91.37%, 91.92%, and 92.00% of their initial efficiency after aging in air atmosphere, the nitrogen‐filled atmosphere at 85 °C, and continuously tracking at the maximum power‐point under one‐sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) for 1200 h, respectively.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
3D Pillar‐layered COFs (PL‐COFs) with adjustable interlayer spacing, enhanced crystallinity, and increased porosity are designed and constructed using a pillaring strategy via metal‐ligand coordination, which demonstrates significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2‐to‐CO conversion compared to their 2D layered COF counterparts.








Abstract
Growing global concerns over energy security and climate change have intensified efforts to develop sustainable strategies for electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2RR). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for eCO2RR due to their tunable structures, high surface areas, and abundance of active sites. However, the performance of 2D COFs is often limited by layer stacking, which restricts active site exposure and reduces selectivity. To overcome these challenges, a new class of COFs known as pillar‐layered COFs (PL‐COFs) is developed featuring adjustable interlayer spacing and a 3D architecture. Characterization using PXRD, TEM, XPS, and EIS confirmed the successful integration of pillar molecules, which leads to increased interlayer spacing, crystallinity, and porosity. These structural advancements result in significantly improved electrochemical activity and selectivity for CO2‐to‐CO conversion. Density functional theory simulations revealed that enhanced CO2 adsorption and CO desorption contribute to the outstanding performance of PL‐COF‐1, which boasts the largest interlayer spacing. This material achieved an impressive Faradaic efficiency of 91.3% and demonstrated a significant current density, outperforming both the original COF‐366‐Co and PL‐COF‐2. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the pillaring strategy in optimizing COF‐based electrocatalysts, paving the way for next‐generation materials for CO2 reduction and sustainable energy conversion.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
MgTe2O5 with 0D structure has been successfully selected and grown as a waveplate crystal. The MgTe2O5 crystal shows tiny birefringence of 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5 µm with a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW cm−2. This work provides a novel waveplate crystal and excellent waveplate devices.








Abstract
Waveplates are important optical components to control the polarization of light. Currently, they are often fabricated from uniaxial crystals, and there is no report about waveplates based on the biaxial crystals. In this work, a novel biaxial crystal MgTe2O5 with a structure constructed by 0D Te2O5 groups is designed and grown as waveplate materials for the first time. The exciting result is that the birefringence in the (001)‐plane is smaller than 0.0028 in the range from 0.4 to 5 µm, which is significantly smaller than that of the current waveplate materials. The polarization modulations of the MgTe2O5 devices working at 532 nm indicate that excellent zero‐order half and quarter waveplates have been successfully prepared. In addition, achromatic waveplates used in the visible, near‐infrared, and mid‐infrared ranges have also been calculated. The MgTe2O5 crystal not only exhibits a high laser damage threshold of up to 2.7 GW cm−2 but also shows a wide transmission range from 0.37 to 6.3 µm. These results provide an excellent waveplate crystal and explore the applications of biaxial crystals.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel Li‐rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li‐ion conduction in composite solid‐state electrolytes. Negatively charged cation defects intensify the concentration enrichment of Li ions on the nanofiller surface, inducing the formation of interconnected Li‐rich transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibits an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1 × 10⁻3 S cm⁻1 at room temperature.








Abstract
Solid‐state lithium (Li) metal batteries (SSLMBs) have garnered considerable attention due to their potential for high energy density and intrinsic safety. However, their widespread development has been hindered by the low ionic conductivity of solid‐state electrolytes. In this contribution, a novel Li‐rich transport mechanism is proposed to achieve ultrafast Li‐ion conduction in composite solid‐state electrolytes. By incorporating cation‐deficient dielectric nanofillers into polymer matrices, it is found that negatively charged cation defects effectively intensify the adsorption of Li ions, resulting in a high Li‐ion concentration enrichment on the surface of fillers. More importantly, these formed Li‐rich layers are interconnected to establish continuous ultrafast Li‐ion transport networks. The composite electrolyte exhibited a remarkably low ion transport activation energy (0.17 eV) and achieved an unprecedented ionic conductivity of approaching 1 × 10⁻3 S cm⁻1 at room temperature. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mo0.1O2 full cells demonstrated an extended cycling life of over 200 cycles with a capacity retention of 70.7%. This work provides a fresh insight into improving Li‐ion transport by constructing interconnected Li‐rich transport networks, paving the way for the development of high‐performance SSLMBs.

Synopsis: Utilizing a 2D framework matrix, a strategy is presented to balance Cr3⁺‐pair emissions at high doping concentrations while effectively suppressing undesirable quenching, thereby ensuring sustained luminescent efficiency.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable near‐infrared emitters related to Cr3+‐pairs for advanced optoelectronic devices remains a challenge due to concentration quenching effects and unclear luminescence mechanisms. In this study, Cr3+ ions are incorporated into a matrix structure consisting of ZnAl₂O₄ spinel units separated by 11.312 Å, effectively restricting energy transfer between luminescent centers and alleviating quenching effects. Computational analysis identifies the lattice positions of isolated Cr3+ ions and Cr3+‐pairs at different doping levels, providing insights into their spatial distribution and local structural environments. Photoluminescence measurements reveals a Cr3+‐concentration‐dependent emission broadening, with a Cr3+‐pair emission band peak at 750 nm, while detailed spectral analysis further clarified the energy level structure of Cr3+‐pairs for the first time. Enhanced material performance is achieved through flux‐assisted synthesis, reaching a high external quantum efficiency of 58.3%. Consequently, the assembled pc‐LEDs exhibit minimal efficiency roll‐off and achieve a high output of 183 mW at 650 mA, demonstrating their potential in near‐infrared light sources and night vision technology application.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A biomass‐derived carbon integrated with Zn single‐atom catalysts for iodine hosting is designed, integrating the high specific surface area, hierarchical porosity, and nitrogen doping of carbon, along with the excellent chemical confinement and electrocatalytic properties of Zn single atoms. This enabled Zn‐I2 batteries to achieve a long lifespan of 80 000 cycles at 10 A g−1 with 93.6% capacity retention.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc iodine (Zn‐I2) batteries have attracted attention due to their low cost, environmental compatibility, and high specific capacity. However, their development is hindered by the severe shuttle effect of polyiodides and the slow redox conversion kinetics of the iodine (I2) cathode. Herein, a long‐life Zn‐I2 battery is developed by anchoring iodine within an edible fungus slag‐derived carbon matrix encapsulated with Zn single‐atom catalysts (SAZn@CFS). The high N content and microporous structure of SAZn@CFS provide a strong iodine confinement, while the Zn‐N4‐C sites chemical interact with polyiodides effectively mitigating the iodine dissolution and the polyiodide shuttle effect. Additionally, the uniformly distributed SAZn sites significantly enhance the redox conversion efficiency of I−/I3−/I5−/I2, leading to improved capacity. At a high current density of 10 A g−1, the designed Zn‐I2 battery delivers an excellent capacity of 147.2 mAh g−1 and a long lifespan of over 80 000 cycles with 93.6% capacity retention. Furthermore, the battery exhibits stable operation for 3500 times even at 50 °C, demonstrating significant advances in iodine reversible storage. This synergistic strategy optimizes composite structure, offering a practical approach to meet the requirements of high‐performance Zn‐I2 batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This article presents an innovative approach to developing pH‐responsive thiopyrylium‐based NIR‐II fluorophores with enhanced photoacoustic and photodynamic properties. By precisely modulating molecular aggregation, the study demonstrates significant advances in tumor‐targeted dual‐modal imaging and therapy, providing a promising pathway for future cancer diagnosis and treatment.








Abstract
Aggregation profoundly influences the photophysical properties of molecules. Here, a new series of thiopyrylium‐based hemicyanine near‐infrared II (NIR‐II) fluorophores is developed by meticulously adjusting their aggregation states. Notably, the star molecule HTPA exhibits a remarkable pH‐responsive behavior and a significant increase in photoacoustic (PA) intensity when aggregated. Additionally, their behavior and pH reversibility during aggregation formation are systematically investigated, including computational optimization, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, NMR analysis, and single crystal analysis. Finally, an innovative “off ” nanoparticle specifically is designed for effective tumor‐targeted PA/NIR‐II dual‐modal imaging and photodynamic therapy by utilizing a pH‐responsive polymer. The signal‐to‐background ratio (SBR) of PA signals significantly increased to 169 in the region of interest (ROI) in the mouse model when irradiated at 1064 nm. These findings not only provide a promising avenue for future studies of NIR‐II small molecules but also pave the way for significant advances in the field of integrated cancer diagnosis and therapy.

A high‐entropy alloy catalyst capable of stable hydrogen precipitation at current densities of −500 and −1000 mA·cm−2 is successfully developed with negligible activity loss over 100 h. This work offers new insights and approaches for designing HEAs that reliably produce hydrogen at high current densities.








Abstract
Efficient and stable electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at high current densities is highly desirable for industrial‐scale hydrogen production, which is yet challenging, because of the electrocatalyst with short lifespans during the acidic HER process. Here, a controllable preparation technique is successfully developed to synthesize PdPtRuRhAu high‐entropy alloys (HEAs) of various sizes, within the 3.14 nm particles (HEA‐3.14) demonstrating exceptional catalytic performance and stable hydrogen production at current densities of −500 and −1000 mA·cm−2 with negligible activity loss over 100 h. Theoretical calculations indicate that the bridge adsorption site of Pd–Au serves as an ideal location for HER, with HEA‐3.14 possessing the highest proportion of such sites, reaching 18.97%. To further analyze the thermodynamic stability of HEAs, an element‐encoding machine learning model is developed from over 300 000 preprocessed dataset of HEAs that achieving an impressively low RMSE of 58.6 °C and a high R2 value of 0.98. By integrating thermodynamic modeling with machine learning methods, the melting point of the PdPtRuRhAu HEAs at 3.14 nm (366 °C) is predicted, which aligns well with the results obtained from differential scanning calorimetry tests. This work offers new insights and approaches for designing HEAs that reliably produce hydrogen at high current densities.

Metallic MoO3‐x is successfully prepared at the kilogram scale and exhibits an outstanding STA efficiency (≈0.3%) under simulated‐solar irradiation. Its potential scalability of the large‐scale photocatalytic system stems from a high STA efficiency (0.03%) and good stability (6 days) of the 1 m2 panel reactor system, yielding solar fertilizer ((NH4)2SO4).








Abstract
Harnessing solar energy to convert molecular N2 into nitrogen‐rich chemicals (e.g., ammonia) provides a potential pathway for the manufacture of “solar fertilizers”. However, the solar‐to‐ammonia (STA) efficiency of most solar fertilizer systems developed to date is less than 0.1%. Herein, an outstanding STA efficiency of ≈0.3% using a metallic molybdenum trioxide (metallic MoO3‐x) photocatalyst under simulated‐solar irradiation is reported, with localized surface plasmon resonance phenomena in the metallic MoO3‐x photocatalyst enhancing both light utilization and N2 activation. The potential scalability of the photocatalytic technology is demonstrated in a 1 m2 panel reactor system, with a high STA efficiency and good stability demonstrated over 6 days of outdoor testing, yielding a solid (NH4)2SO4 product for easy collection. The as‐designed square‐meter outdoor reaction system facilitates the integration of solar fertilizer technology with existing agricultural infrastructure.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Industrial pillar Barium titanate‐based bulk ceramic capacitors suffer from low energy storage density, hindering their use in advanced applications. By designing a favorable local structure and optimizing chemical composition to improve local polarization and refine grain structure, energy density above 15 J cm−3 is achieved, along with superior overall performance, overcoming the current bottleneck of this capacitor type.








Abstract
Pb‐free dielectric energy storage capacitors are core components in advanced pulse‐power electronic systems and devices. However, the relatively low energy density (Wrec) for the industrial pillar BaTiO3 (BT)‐based capacitors remains a significant obstacle for their cutting‐edge applications, due to their low intrinsic polarization and breakdown strength (EB). Herein, through chemical composition and local structure design, a giant Wrec of 15.1 J cm−3 along with a high efficiency (η) of 85% is demonstrated in a BT‐based relaxor bulk ceramic. This is achieved by introducing rare A‐site polarization enhancement substitution (Bi0.5Na0.5)2+ ions in combination with B‐site fastest relaxation alternative (Zn1/3Nb2/3)4+ ions to enhance local polarization and refine grain structure. Atomic‐level local structure analysis has revealed that the diversified atomic polar displacement vectors, characterized by largely extended magnitude and heterogeneous directions, assemble into highly polarizable clusters at several unit‐cells scale. Consequently, it exerts a large polarization difference (ΔP) of 49 µC cm−2 and a high EB of 90 kV mm−1. Moreover, a giant power density (677 MW cm−3), high discharge energy density (3.9 J cm−3), and excellent stability are achieved. This study overcomes the current Wrec bottleneck of ≈10 J cm−3 in BT‐based bulk ceramics, presenting an approach to optimize the energy storage performance of Pb‐free relaxors.

The Printess is a low‐cost, open‐source, multimaterial 3D printer for direct ink writing. Built for under $250, it is highly customizable and supports various advanced direct ink writing modalities, including multimaterial mixing, multimaterial multinozzle, and embedded 3D printing. The bioprinter's easy assembly, low cost, and high precision make it suitable for both research and educational settings.









Abstract
Direct ink writing is a 3D printing method that is compatible with a wide range of structural, elastomeric, electronic, and living materials, and it continues to expand its uses into physics, engineering, and biology laboratories. However, the large footprint, closed hardware and software ecosystems, and expense of commercial systems often hamper widespread adoption. This work introduces a compact, low‐cost, multimaterial, and high‐throughput direct ink writing 3D printer platform with detailed assembly files and instructions provided freely online. In contrast to existing low‐cost 3D printers and bioprinters, which typically modify off‐the‐shelf plastic 3D printers, this system is built from scratch, offering a lower cost and full customizability. Active mixing of cell‐laden bioinks, high‐throughput production of auxetic lattices using multimaterial multinozzle 3D (MM3D) printing methods, and a high‐toughness, photocurable hydrogel for fabrication of heart valves are introduced. Finally, hardware for embedded multinozzle and 3D gradient nozzle printing is developed for producing high‐throughput and graded 3D parts. This powerful, simple‐to‐build, and customizable printing platform can help stimulate a vibrant biomaker community of engineers, biologists, and educators.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A crystallization‐kinetics modulation strategy has been developed to synergistically regulate the hierarchical morphology in a typical bulk heterojunction blend, via introducing a polymer donor and a small molecule acceptor as the nucleation agent and plasticizer, respectively. Consequently, a decent device efficiency of 20.1% is obtained.








Abstract
Obtaining controllable active layer morphology plays a significant role in boosting the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a quaternary strategy, which incorporates polymer donor D18‐Cl and small molecule acceptor AITC into the host D18:N3, is employed to precisely modulate crystallization kinetics for favorable morphology evolution within the active layer. In situ spectroscopic measurements during film‐formation demonstrate that while D18‐Cl works as a nucleator to promote aggregation of D18 and foster donor/acceptor intermixing, AITC has exactly the opposite impact on aggregation of N3 and intermixing kinetics of donor and acceptor, working as a plasticizer. The mutually compensational effect of the dual‐guests, as a result, enables synergistic control over fibrillar networks, multi‐length scale morphology, and vertical phase distribution, leading to optimized 3D morphology for greatly enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer, suppressed charge recombination, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, the quaternary OSCs based on D18:D18‐Cl:N3:AITC achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which represents one of the highest efficiencies for single‐junction OSCs. This work presents an effective strategy to precisely regulate crystallization kinetics toward advanced morphology control for high‐performance OSCs.

An optimized nickel‐doped iridium (Ir) dioxide catalyst with optimized compressive strain and oxygen (O) vacancies, enhances Ir─O covalency, reduces the Ir─Ir distance, and accelerates water adsorption, breaking the linear scaling relationship of intermediates binding for efficient oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Iridium‐based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), but the linear scaling relationship (LSR) of multiple reaction intermediates binding inhibits the enhancement of its activity. Herein, the compressive strain and oxygen vacancy effect exists in iridium dioxide (IrO2)‐based catalyst by a doping engineering strategy for efficient acidic OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations elucidate that compressive strain can enhance Ir─O covalency and reduce the Ir─Ir bond distance, and oxygen vacancy (Ov) as an electronic regulator causes rapid adsorption of water molecules on the Ir and adjacent Ov (Ir─Ov) pair site to be coupled directly into *O─O* intermediates. Importantly, hence, volcano‐shape curves are established between the compressive strain/oxygen vacancy and OER current using OER as the probe reaction. Theoretical calculation reveals Ni dopant can modulate Ir 5d‐ and O 2p‐band centers for increasing overlap of Ir 5d and O 2p orbits to trigger a continuous metal site‐oxygen vacancy synergistic mechanism (MS‐OVSM) pathway, successfully breaking the LSR of intermediates binding during OER. Therefore, the resultant proton‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) device fabricated using T‐0.24Ni/IrO2 delivers a current density of 500 mA cm−2 and operates stably for 500 h.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A small‐grain‐rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) geometry can provide sufficient paths for excellent Li+ ion supply capacity, and a soft‐solvating electrolyte can enhance the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast charging conditions. Isobutyronitrile‐based electrolytes provide high discharge capacity during fast charging cycles while mitigating lithium plating on the anode.








Abstract
The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li+ ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions during fast‐charging of Li‐ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile‐based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li+ ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN‐containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li+ ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 °C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.

The monochromatic responsive hydrogen‐bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructure is first achieved based on the VIA‐group‐based framework hybridization, which enables the concealment of intrinsic fingerprint character and the expression of multicolor responsive mode, further serving as fully‐covert photonic barcodes. These findings offer novel insight on exploitating smart‐responsive hetero‐HOFs for high‐security anti‐counterfeiting devices.








Abstract
Luminescent responsive heterostructures with region‐domained emission and integrated responsiveness exhibit great potential in information security, but always suffer from the direct exposure of fingerprint information at the initial state, making it easy to decode the hidden confidential information. Herein, the first monochromatic responsive hydrogen‐bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructures are reported based on VIA‐group‐based framework hybridization toward fully‐covert photonic barcodes. Designed HOF blocks with different VIA‐group elements are integrated via a configuration‐assimilation‐based assembly method to generate the intrinsic monochromatic HOF heterostructures. Differentiated electronegativity of VIA‐group elements endows each HOF block with distinct bonding stability, which triggers different responsive actions to the same stimuli, finally forming the multicolor emission mode at a responsive state. These monochromatic responsive HOF heterostructures can effectively hide the intrinsic fingerprint information, which further demonstrates the fully‐covert photonic coding capability as high‐security anti‐counterfeiting labels. These findings offer novel insight on the exploitation of smart‐responsive hetero‐HOF systems for advanced information encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.

Microneedles reverse photoaging wrinkles. In this study, a magnesium galvanic cell bipolar microneedle composed of redox reaction is introduced. Through playing the role of antioxidant, anti‐inflammatory, cell migration, angiogenesis and so on, it can combine action of hydrogen, magnesium ion and micro‐current to repair the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation and rejuvenate the skin.








Abstract
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major factor in the development of skin photoaging wrinkles. While current treatments can slow the progression of photoaging, it is very difficult to achieve complete reversal. This study introduces galvanic cell microneedle (GCMN) patches with magnesium‐containing bipolar electrodes. These patches operate through a galvanic cell mechanism, generating microcurrents and releasing hydrogen gas and magnesium ions via a redox reaction. The combination of hydrogen's antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory properties, microcurrent‐induced stimulation of cell migration, and magnesium's promotion of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 anti‐inflammatory polarization synergistically works to reverse photoaging wrinkles and rejuvenate the skin. Furthermore, this work examines how GCMNs may influence the transforming growth factor‐β/Smad (TGF‐β/Smad) pathway. This approach shows promise for advancing research and development in the field of medical cosmetology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
N‐doped CoTe2 composites, incorporating 3D low‐tortuosity tunneling structure, self‐catalytic N─Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong‐lifespan potassium storage performance over 25 000 cycles with an ultra‐low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.








Abstract
Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion‐diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (KxTey). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe2 composite equipped with a self‐catalytic center (N‐CoTe2/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low‐tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self‐catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N‐CoTe2/LTTC provides a short‐range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K+ diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N─Co bonds self‐catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for KxTey under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N‐CoTe2/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong‑lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te‐based anodes. Finally, the N‐CoTe2/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g−1). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of KxTey and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong‐lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel surface spraying technique enhances evaporation materials, boosting solar‐driven evaporation rates by 297% versus controls with broad substrate compatibility. Its nanogel spray featuring nanoconfined pores facilitates water‐cluster formation and diffusion, reducing evaporation enthalpy to advance seawater desalination technologies. 








Abstract
Accelerating water evaporation is vital for processes like photosynthesis, dehydration, and desalination. Optimizing the pore structure and interfacial properties of evaporative materials can reduce evaporation enthalpy and increase efficiency. However, integrating the evaporation interface with water transport channels poses significant design challenges and complicates low‐enthalpy evaporation analysis. To address these challenges, a hydrophilic nanovesicle gel is developed with a hydrophobic mesoporous structure as an ideal spray. This spray effectively upgrades their interface of universal substrates (including PVA hydrogels, balsa wood, nanofiltration membrane, cellulose paper, nylon fabrics, etc.), enabling the simple preparation of evaporation materials. The sprayed samples, at a low spraying dose of 40 mg cm−2, achieved evaporation rates of 1.58 and 3.26 kg m−2 h−1 under 0.5 and 1 sun irradiance, which are 297% and 268% higher than their respective substrates. These nanogels offer benefits like edibility, low cost, ease of use, and compatibility with various substrates, showing great potential in seawater desalination, dehydration technology, crop yield enhancement, and coating/paint drying. More importantly, this work highlights the need for researchers to focus on the surface structure of materials, rather than merely using bulk gels, in the development of high‐performance evaporative materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, the development of soft, biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) for high‐resolution, long‐term electromyography recording is done. In human and in vivo animal trials, LMe captures continuous neuromuscular signals of the muscle, evaluating the efficacy of rehabilitative drugs for muscle trauma. This work enables improved diagnostics and drug modeling for muscle disorders using a soft device interface.








Abstract
Electromyography (EMG) is a widely used diagnostic technique for evaluating the electrical activity of muscles and their controlling nerves. However, conventional surface electrodes with planar structures often suffer from low spatial resolution and suboptimal signal quality. Here, 3D‐shaped, substrate‐free, soft, and biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) are presented as a wearable interface for neuromuscular signal recording. These electrodes enable the acquisition of high‐quality EMG signals while their intrinsic mechanical softness supports long‐term use in clinical settings. In a human pilot study, continuous, high‐spatial‐resolution EMG monitoring of musculoskeletal activity over 25 days is achieved. Furthermore, in vivo EMG monitoring in mouse models of ischemia and volumetric muscle loss demonstrated the therapeutic effects of extracellular muscle‐rehabilitative drugs. This work highlights the potential of LMe for advanced drug screening and long‐term clinical diagnostics.

<title>Co‐Delivery of Morphologically Switchable Au Nanowire and Hemoglobin‐Resveratrol Nanoparticles in the Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Healing Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To achieve synergistic therapy of diabetic wounds, morphologically switchable Au nanowires (ANW) and resveratrol‐hemoglobin (HR) nanoparticles are co‐loaded into the microneedles. The morphologically adaptable ANW continuously consumes glucose, while HR improves hypoxia, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and inhibits the differentiation of M1‐type macrophages. This work thus realizes the long‐term management of glucose during synergistic diabetic wound healing therapy.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes and pose a significant threat to human health. High glucose concentration in the wound remains a major obstacle, necessitating effective strategies to achieve sustained glucose consumption for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In this study, an Au‐based nanomaterial is developed that can adjust its morphology in different therapeutic processes. The prepared Au nanowire (ANW) can be converted into Au nanospheres (AS) under ultrasonic conditions by adjusting the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on its surface for convenient delivery. Intriguingly, AS is depolymerized into ANW again in the wound area, prolonging the retention time, and ensuring continuous consumption of glucose. After constructing the morphologically switchable Au nanowire, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is applied it to microneedle and co‐delivered it with hemoglobin (Hb)‐resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)‐induced diabetic mouse model, the microneedle degraded gradually, and the Hb‐RES nanoparticles synergistically ameliorated hypoxia, scavenged ROS, and inhibited macrophage differentiation into pro‐inflammatory M1 phenotypes. During this process, ANW continuously catalyzed glucose through its inherent glucose oxidase activity. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the long‐term management of glucose concentration during synergistic diabetic wound healing.

<title>Scalable Van Der Waals Integration of III‐N Devices Over 2D Materials for CMOS‐Compatible Architectures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, an innovative technology is presented that will transform current monolithic and heterogeneous integration by using BEOL‐compatible fluidic‐assisted self‐alignment transfer and integration process. Multi‐dimensional integration of III‐N optical and electronic devices over 2D materials on CMOS is demonstrated with no epitaxial constraints or different process thermal budgets.









Abstract
Advances in semiconductor technology have been primarily driven by exponentially reducing the size of silicon transistors and pushing the quantum limit. However, continued scaling becomes extremely difficult in accordance with Moore's law. Conversely, recent advances in monolithic and heterogeneous integration by exploring non‐group IV materials envision beyond CMOS scaling. This study entails the development of scalable van der Waals (vdW) integration technology by using all CMOS back‐end‐of‐line‐compatible processes: vertical 3D and lateral 2D integration of III‐N devices, 2D materials (graphene and molybdenum disulfide), and CMOS. Advanced fluidic‐assisted self‐alignment transfer (FAST) provides a process accuracy of ≈ 32.6 nm as analyzed on a 200 mm wafer scale. The freestanding III‐N chips are vdW integrated onto 2D materials, and the vdW interfaced multi‐layer graphene successfully functioned as a back‐gating interconnect line. Moreover, fidelity of the vdW interface is confirmed by conducting systematic yield, uniformity, and reliability analysis. The unique fourfold rotationally symmetric design of GaN transistors makes them compatible with massive and random FAST processing. GaN‐based radio‐frequency power and cascode GaN/Si transistors are integrated on silicon‐on‐insulator‐CMOS. The proposed approach affords a remarkable advantage by surpassing the physical limits and facilitating functional diversification, thus advancing the concept of “More than Moore.”

<title>Precise Control Over Crystallization Kinetics by Combining Nucleating Agents and Plasticizers for 20.1% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A crystallization‐kinetics modulation strategy has been developed to synergistically regulate the hierarchical morphology in a typical bulk heterojunction blend, via introducing a polymer donor and a small molecule acceptor as the nucleation agent and plasticizer, respectively. Consequently, a decent device efficiency of 20.1% is obtained.








Abstract
Obtaining controllable active layer morphology plays a significant role in boosting the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a quaternary strategy, which incorporates polymer donor D18‐Cl and small molecule acceptor AITC into the host D18:N3, is employed to precisely modulate crystallization kinetics for favorable morphology evolution within the active layer. In situ spectroscopic measurements during film‐formation demonstrate that while D18‐Cl works as a nucleator to promote aggregation of D18 and foster donor/acceptor intermixing, AITC has exactly the opposite impact on aggregation of N3 and intermixing kinetics of donor and acceptor, working as a plasticizer. The mutually compensational effect of the dual‐guests, as a result, enables synergistic control over fibrillar networks, multi‐length scale morphology, and vertical phase distribution, leading to optimized 3D morphology for greatly enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer, suppressed charge recombination, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, the quaternary OSCs based on D18:D18‐Cl:N3:AITC achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which represents one of the highest efficiencies for single‐junction OSCs. This work presents an effective strategy to precisely regulate crystallization kinetics toward advanced morphology control for high‐performance OSCs.

<title>Unraveling Compressive Strain and Oxygen Vacancy Effect of Iridium Oxide for Proton‐Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>

An optimized nickel‐doped iridium (Ir) dioxide catalyst with optimized compressive strain and oxygen (O) vacancies, enhances Ir─O covalency, reduces the Ir─Ir distance, and accelerates water adsorption, breaking the linear scaling relationship of intermediates binding for efficient oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Iridium‐based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), but the linear scaling relationship (LSR) of multiple reaction intermediates binding inhibits the enhancement of its activity. Herein, the compressive strain and oxygen vacancy effect exists in iridium dioxide (IrO2)‐based catalyst by a doping engineering strategy for efficient acidic OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations elucidate that compressive strain can enhance Ir─O covalency and reduce the Ir─Ir bond distance, and oxygen vacancy (Ov) as an electronic regulator causes rapid adsorption of water molecules on the Ir and adjacent Ov (Ir─Ov) pair site to be coupled directly into *O─O* intermediates. Importantly, hence, volcano‐shape curves are established between the compressive strain/oxygen vacancy and OER current using OER as the probe reaction. Theoretical calculation reveals Ni dopant can modulate Ir 5d‐ and O 2p‐band centers for increasing overlap of Ir 5d and O 2p orbits to trigger a continuous metal site‐oxygen vacancy synergistic mechanism (MS‐OVSM) pathway, successfully breaking the LSR of intermediates binding during OER. Therefore, the resultant proton‐exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) device fabricated using T‐0.24Ni/IrO2 delivers a current density of 500 mA cm−2 and operates stably for 500 h.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A small‐grain‐rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) geometry can provide sufficient paths for excellent Li+ ion supply capacity, and a soft‐solvating electrolyte can enhance the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast charging conditions. Isobutyronitrile‐based electrolytes provide high discharge capacity during fast charging cycles while mitigating lithium plating on the anode.








Abstract
The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li+ ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions during fast‐charging of Li‐ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile‐based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li+ ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN‐containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li+ ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 °C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.

A novel surface spraying technique enhances evaporation materials, boosting solar‐driven evaporation rates by 297% versus controls with broad substrate compatibility. Its nanogel spray featuring nanoconfined pores facilitates water‐cluster formation and diffusion, reducing evaporation enthalpy to advance seawater desalination technologies. 








Abstract
Accelerating water evaporation is vital for processes like photosynthesis, dehydration, and desalination. Optimizing the pore structure and interfacial properties of evaporative materials can reduce evaporation enthalpy and increase efficiency. However, integrating the evaporation interface with water transport channels poses significant design challenges and complicates low‐enthalpy evaporation analysis. To address these challenges, a hydrophilic nanovesicle gel is developed with a hydrophobic mesoporous structure as an ideal spray. This spray effectively upgrades their interface of universal substrates (including PVA hydrogels, balsa wood, nanofiltration membrane, cellulose paper, nylon fabrics, etc.), enabling the simple preparation of evaporation materials. The sprayed samples, at a low spraying dose of 40 mg cm−2, achieved evaporation rates of 1.58 and 3.26 kg m−2 h−1 under 0.5 and 1 sun irradiance, which are 297% and 268% higher than their respective substrates. These nanogels offer benefits like edibility, low cost, ease of use, and compatibility with various substrates, showing great potential in seawater desalination, dehydration technology, crop yield enhancement, and coating/paint drying. More importantly, this work highlights the need for researchers to focus on the surface structure of materials, rather than merely using bulk gels, in the development of high‐performance evaporative materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this study, the development of soft, biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) for high‐resolution, long‐term electromyography recording is done. In human and in vivo animal trials, LMe captures continuous neuromuscular signals of the muscle, evaluating the efficacy of rehabilitative drugs for muscle trauma. This work enables improved diagnostics and drug modeling for muscle disorders using a soft device interface.








Abstract
Electromyography (EMG) is a widely used diagnostic technique for evaluating the electrical activity of muscles and their controlling nerves. However, conventional surface electrodes with planar structures often suffer from low spatial resolution and suboptimal signal quality. Here, 3D‐shaped, substrate‐free, soft, and biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) are presented as a wearable interface for neuromuscular signal recording. These electrodes enable the acquisition of high‐quality EMG signals while their intrinsic mechanical softness supports long‐term use in clinical settings. In a human pilot study, continuous, high‐spatial‐resolution EMG monitoring of musculoskeletal activity over 25 days is achieved. Furthermore, in vivo EMG monitoring in mouse models of ischemia and volumetric muscle loss demonstrated the therapeutic effects of extracellular muscle‐rehabilitative drugs. This work highlights the potential of LMe for advanced drug screening and long‐term clinical diagnostics.

<title>Co‐Delivery of Morphologically Switchable Au Nanowire and Hemoglobin‐Resveratrol Nanoparticles in the Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Healing Therapy</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419430?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To achieve synergistic therapy of diabetic wounds, morphologically switchable Au nanowires (ANW) and resveratrol‐hemoglobin (HR) nanoparticles are co‐loaded into the microneedles. The morphologically adaptable ANW continuously consumes glucose, while HR improves hypoxia, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and inhibits the differentiation of M1‐type macrophages. This work thus realizes the long‐term management of glucose during synergistic diabetic wound healing therapy.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes and pose a significant threat to human health. High glucose concentration in the wound remains a major obstacle, necessitating effective strategies to achieve sustained glucose consumption for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In this study, an Au‐based nanomaterial is developed that can adjust its morphology in different therapeutic processes. The prepared Au nanowire (ANW) can be converted into Au nanospheres (AS) under ultrasonic conditions by adjusting the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on its surface for convenient delivery. Intriguingly, AS is depolymerized into ANW again in the wound area, prolonging the retention time, and ensuring continuous consumption of glucose. After constructing the morphologically switchable Au nanowire, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is applied it to microneedle and co‐delivered it with hemoglobin (Hb)‐resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)‐induced diabetic mouse model, the microneedle degraded gradually, and the Hb‐RES nanoparticles synergistically ameliorated hypoxia, scavenged ROS, and inhibited macrophage differentiation into pro‐inflammatory M1 phenotypes. During this process, ANW continuously catalyzed glucose through its inherent glucose oxidase activity. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the long‐term management of glucose concentration during synergistic diabetic wound healing.

<title>Scalable Van Der Waals Integration of III‐N Devices Over 2D Materials for CMOS‐Compatible Architectures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, an innovative technology is presented that will transform current monolithic and heterogeneous integration by using BEOL‐compatible fluidic‐assisted self‐alignment transfer and integration process. Multi‐dimensional integration of III‐N optical and electronic devices over 2D materials on CMOS is demonstrated with no epitaxial constraints or different process thermal budgets.









Abstract
Advances in semiconductor technology have been primarily driven by exponentially reducing the size of silicon transistors and pushing the quantum limit. However, continued scaling becomes extremely difficult in accordance with Moore's law. Conversely, recent advances in monolithic and heterogeneous integration by exploring non‐group IV materials envision beyond CMOS scaling. This study entails the development of scalable van der Waals (vdW) integration technology by using all CMOS back‐end‐of‐line‐compatible processes: vertical 3D and lateral 2D integration of III‐N devices, 2D materials (graphene and molybdenum disulfide), and CMOS. Advanced fluidic‐assisted self‐alignment transfer (FAST) provides a process accuracy of ≈ 32.6 nm as analyzed on a 200 mm wafer scale. The freestanding III‐N chips are vdW integrated onto 2D materials, and the vdW interfaced multi‐layer graphene successfully functioned as a back‐gating interconnect line. Moreover, fidelity of the vdW interface is confirmed by conducting systematic yield, uniformity, and reliability analysis. The unique fourfold rotationally symmetric design of GaN transistors makes them compatible with massive and random FAST processing. GaN‐based radio‐frequency power and cascode GaN/Si transistors are integrated on silicon‐on‐insulator‐CMOS. The proposed approach affords a remarkable advantage by surpassing the physical limits and facilitating functional diversification, thus advancing the concept of “More than Moore.”

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Near‐infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR‐ALINs) are fascinating due to their optical property of continuing to emit near‐infrared luminescence after excitation ceases. This review highlights recent progress in the rational design, modulation strategies and biological applications of NIR‐ALINs. The challenges and opportunities in this field are discussed with the aim of stimulating further developments in biological applications using NIR‐ALINs.








Abstract
Near‐infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR‐ALINs) possess the unique property of continuing to emit near‐infrared (NIR) luminescence after excitation ceases. They demonstrate excellent photostability, deep tissue penetration, and high imaging signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, NIR‐ALINs can be re‐excited in vivo using visible (Vis), NIR light or X‐rays, which avoids the need for continuous in situ excitation, thus eliminating autofluorescence of biological tissues and reducing the tediousness of multiple injections. These features make NIR‐ALINs particularly attractive for biological applications. In recent years, a series of NIR‐ALINs with prolonged afterglow time and enhanced luminescence intensity have been discovered. However, the development of NIR‐ALINs still faces significant challenges, as their NIR afterglow performance is usually insufficient to satisfy practical biological applications. There is still a lack of systematic analysis of the strategies for the regulation of NIR afterglow luminescence in inorganic nanomaterials. This review highlights the rational design and modulation strategies of NIR‐ALINs, focusing on host substrate selection, trap engineering modulation and surface modification. Moreover, the biological applications of NIR‐ALINs in bioimaging, bio‐detection and disease therapy are summarized. Finally, the present challenges and perspectives in biological applications, such as insufficient afterglow properties and unclear biosafety, are also discussed.

<title>Skin‐Inspired and Self‐Regulated Hydrophobic Hydrogel for Diabetic Wound Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A skin‐mimetic smart hydrophobic hydrogel is developed for efficient diabetic wound therapy. Thehydrophobic segments form dense “epidermis”, ensuring prolonged drug diffusion, long‐term water retention, and high water content. Meanwhile, the responsive segments generate glucose‐labile “sweat pores”, facilitating on‐demand drug release to remodel the hostile wound microenvironment.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are refractory and recurrent diseases that necessitate the development of multifunctional dressings. Inspired by the structure and function of the skin, we herein delicately design a novel swollen hydrophobic hydrogel (QL@MAB) composed of hydrophobic methyl acrylate (MA) and (3‐acrylamidophenyl)boronic acid (AAPBA) network and co‐loaded with antioxidant quercetin (Q) and antibiotic levofloxacin (L) for efficient diabetic wound therapy. The hydrophobic MA segments undergo phase separation to form a dense “epidermis”, ensuring prolonged drug diffusion, long‐term water retention, and high water content. Meanwhile, the AAPBA segments generate glucose‐labile “sweat pores” via borate ester bonds with the polyphenol drug Q. Upon encountering the hyperglycemic wound microenvironment, the “sweat pores” are dilated due to the cleavage of the borate ester bonds and exposure of the diffusion channel, facilitating drug release for accelerated wound healing. In the infected diabetic rats, QL@MAB achieves rapid wound debridement and re‐epithelization while promoting angiogenesis, hair follicle regeneration, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Taken together, this study not only represents a multipronged dressing for effective interventions of diabetic wounds but also contributes to the rational design of smart hydrogels tailored for biomedical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Zero leakage, ultralong lifespan, and intrinsic opening sensing are achieved in microvalves, making it feasible to develop high‐performance fluid operation chips and integrated drive‐control systems, which promote the miniaturization, integration, and flexibility of pneumatic flexible robots and human‐machine interaction devices.








Abstract
Valves are critical components in advanced fluid control systems (AFCS) and play a vital role in applications such as soft robotics and medical devices. Traditional mechanical valves often suffer from issues such as leakage and wear, which compromise the efficiency and precision of air‐driven systems. Here, a superlubricity microvalve (SLMV) is developed with characteristics of zero leakage, ultralong lifespan, and self‐sensing capabilities. The SLMV demonstrates zero helium leakage at pressures exceeding 0.9 MPa, and remains defect‐free after one million collision tests and 5000 reciprocating sliding friction tests. Additionally, the valve features self‐powered sensing that can detect its own open status, and thus enhances the self‐feedback control. AFCS equipped with SLMVs may significantly improve the flexibility and functionality of pneumatic robots, facilitating the development of implantable drug delivery devices that are more durable, compact, safe, and reliable.

<title>Machine‐Learning‐Enhanced Trial‐and‐Error for Efficient Optimization of Rubber Composites</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces a novel workflow termed machine‐learning (ML)‐enhanced trial‐and‐error approach, for efficient optimization of rubber composites. This approach integrates orthogonal experimental design with symbolic regression to proficiently extract empirical principles. This integrated approach not only preserves the features of conventional trial‐and‐error methodologies but also substantially enhances their efficiency and effectiveness.








Abstract
The traditional trial‐and‐error approach, although effective, is inefficient for optimizing rubber composites. The latest developments in machine learning (ML)‐assisted methodologies are also not suitable for predicting and optimizing rubber composite properties. This is due to the dependency of the properties on processing conditions, which prevents the alignment of data collected from different sources. In this work, a novel workflow called the ML‐enhanced trial‐and‐error approach is proposed. This approach integrates orthogonal experimental design with symbolic regression (SR) to effectively extract empirical principles. This combination enables the optimization process to retain the characteristics of the traditional trial‐and‐error approach while significantly improving efficiency and capability. Using rubber composites as the model system, the ML‐enhanced trial‐and‐error approach effectively extracts empirical principles encapsulated by high‐frequency terms in the SR‐derived mathematical formulas, offering clear guidance for material property optimization. An online platform has been developed that allows for no‐code usage of the proposed methodology, designed to seamlessly integrate into the existing experimental optimization process.

<title>Synchronizing Multicolor Changes and Shape Deformation Into Structurally Homogeneous Hydrogels via a Single Photochromophore</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A spiropyran‐derived photochromphore that exhibits a concurrent molecular alteration in fluorescence and charge upon irradiation is reported, which simultaneously enables both photochromic and photodeformable capability upon covalent incorporation into a structurally homogenous hydrogel. The engineered hydrogel system demonstrates synchronized multicolor changes (from red to green) and shape deformation (from positive to negative phototropism) under a single stimulus of light illumination.








Abstract
The design of synthetic hydrogels that can mimic their biological counterparts in the simultaneous production of multicolor change and shape transformation in response to environmental stimuli is of great importance toward intelligent camouflage, encryption, and actuation. Previous efforts have focused primarily on developing heterogeneous hydrogels that highly rely on respective mechanisms to achieve color and shape changes separately, and synergistically synchronizing such two variations into structurally homogenous hydrogels via a single chromophore has been challenging. Here, the molecular design of a structurally homogenous hydrogel simultaneously exhibiting synchronized multicolor change and shape deformation triggered by a single stimulus of light is reported. The synchronization mechanism originates from a coupled alteration upon irradiation in the fluorescence emission and charge states of a spiropyran photochromophore covalently incorporated into the hydrogel network, thus leading to macroscale color change and shape variation in the hydrogel, respectively. Following this principle, both positive and negative phototropic deformation are obtained concomitantly with synchronized but flexibly tunable multicolor changes upon light illumination and demonstrated the ingenious application of biomimetic actuation, encryption, and camouflage by the rational combination of these two systems. This work represents an innovative molecular design strategy for developing bioinspired materials with synchronized functions via a single compound.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Increased reliance on renewable energy requires enhanced grid‐scale energy storage. The subject of this review, the high mass loading of electrodes, is critical for determining manufacturing costs. Several of the reviewed fabrication techniques surpass the mass loading of conventional electrodes and achieve values above 100 mg cm−2. These results represent an important step towards meeting future demands for grid storage.








Abstract
The increasing electrification of daily life as well as the intermittent characteristic of renewable energy sources require viable solutions for grid‐scale energy storage. Critical considerations for grid storage applications are electrode mass loading and electrode thickness as these features govern battery pack energy density, an important factor in determining manufacturing costs. For this reason, there is increased interest in finding new ways of creating electrodes with high mass loading. In this review, various high‐mass loading fabrication approaches are considered for positive electrode materials used in batteries. The benchmark used for high mass loading is above 20 mg cm−2, which is higher than the practical limit of conventional tape‐cast electrodes. Several different electrode approaches are described including templating, laser patterning, direct ink writing, and electrodeposition. A variety of materials are covered with the most prominent being LiFe(PO4) (LFP), LiCoO2(LCO), and MnO2. In research to date, scalable electrochemical performance has been achieved with mass loadings over 100 mg cm−2. Areal capacities as high as 14.7 mAh cm−2 at 1.82 mA cm−2 have been achieved in non‐aqueous electrolytes and 9.8 mAh cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 in aqueous electrolytes. These results establish that the mass loading of electrodes can be scaled up without compromising their electrochemical properties.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting are achieved by utilizing the quantum‐confinement effect of MAPbBr3 QDs within the MOFs. This unique anticounterfeiting tag enables high PL intensity and visible recognition to the naked eye and allows for multiple authentications in both time and space dimensions. These results provide valuable insights for designing high‐security, high‐intensity multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting tags.








Abstract
Multicolor dynamic optical materials exhibit significant potential in the realms of anticounterfeiting and information encryption, benefitting from their capacity for generating unpredictable optical information that changes over time. Herein, a novel approach is presented utilizing quantum‐confinement effect of MAPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) embedded within lanthanide‐metal organic frameworks (Ln‐MOFs) for time‐resolved multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting applications. The dimensions of MAPbBr3 QDs undergo temporal variations during in situ growth, resulting in dynamic alterations in luminescent color due to the quantum‐confinement effect. Furthermore, the emission colors of MAPbBr3@Eu‐MOFs can be modulated by varying UV excitation wavelengths, thereby conferring a spatially distinguishable anticounterfeiting dimension. The time‐resolved unpredictability of these dynamic color changes coupled with sustained luminescent intensity and multi‐dimensional anticounterfeiting, render them suitable system for advanced graphical coding. These findings pave the way for the advancement of intelligent multicolor dynamic optical anticounterfeiting.

<title>Anomalous Nonlinear Magnetoconductivity in van der Waals Magnet CrSBr</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anomalous nonlinear magnetoconductivity (NLMC) is demonstrated by manipulating internal magnetic orders in van der Waals magnet CrSBr interfaced by hBN layer. The anomalous NLMC presents multiple resistance states governed by both magnetization vector and Néel vector utilizing the metamagnetic transition of CrSBr. This anomalous NLMC of the engineered CrSBr system promises efficient electrical readout of multiple magnetic information.








Abstract
Nonlinear magnetoconductivity (NLMC) is a nonreciprocal transport response arising in non‐centrosymmetric materials. However, this ordinary NLMC signal vanishes at zero magnetic field, limiting its potential for applications. Here, the observation of an anomalous NLMC controlled by internal order parameters such as the magnetization or Néel vectors is reported. This response is achieved by breaking both inversion and time‐reversal symmetry in artificial van der Waals heterostructures based on the magnetic CrSBr and insulating hBN. The nonreciprocal signal can be tuned between two different states in ferromagnetic monolayer CrSBr and among four different states in antiferromagnetic bilayer CrSBr, thanks to its metamagnetic transition. Remarkably, this output signal in the ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) state of CrSBr is three (one) orders of magnitude higher than those previously measured. A conductivity scaling analysis reveals the Berry connection polarizability as the origin of the anomalous NLMC. The results pave the way for high‐frequency rectifiers with magnetically switchable output polarity as well as for an efficient electrical readout of the magnetic state of antiferromagnetic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
I additive manufacturing process exploits the spatial propagation of a polymerization reaction front to produce 3D polymer parts 10× faster and 1000× more energy efficient  than the fastest stereolithography. In contrast with existing 3D printing, this morphogenic process is inspired by biological “growth and form” due to the self‐directed propagation of the reaction.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's morphogenesis, a new 3D printing process –growth printing (GP)– takes advantage of a self‐propagating curing front to produce 3D polymeric parts following a growth‐like development plan. The propagation of the curing front is driven by the exothermic polymerization of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), which transforms the liquid resin into a stiff polymer as it propagates at 1 mm s−1. GP is triggered when a heated initiator contacts the uncured liquid resin in an open container. The initiator nucleates the frontal polymerization reaction and the isotropic radial propagation of the growth front. Simultaneously, the initiator is moved up across the free surface of the resin, pulling the cured object out of the uncured resin. The motion trajectory of the initiator with respect to the free resin surface controls the growth morphology of the 3D part. An inverse design algorithm is developed to produce 3D parts by modeling the reaction‐diffusion‐driven solidification process. This process has substantial energy savings and high printing speeds.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The SnO2/ZnSb2O6‐x double electron transport layer promotes a highly ordered arrangement of the perovskite lattice, improving film quality and suppressing non‐radiative recombination, which in turn enhances carrier transport and overall device performance. Under photothermal conditions, ZnSb2O6‐x effectively captures oxygen atoms at the SnO2 interface, preventing ion migration and thereby enhancing the photothermal operational stability of PSCs.








Abstract
Stability testing protocols from the International Summit on Organic and Hybrid Solar Cell Stability (ISOS) are essential for standardizing studies on the photothermally operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Under photothermal conditions, the migration of oxygen from SnO2 layer induces cationic dehydrogenation at the A‐site of the perovskite, accelerating degradation to PbI2. This leads to the formation of photoinduced I2 and Pb0 defects, significantly compromising long‐term stability. In this study, ordonezite (ZnSb2O6‐x) as a multifunctional electron transport layer (ETL) that captures migrating oxygen atoms at the SnO2/perovskite interface is introduced, effectively preventing degradation of the buried interface. Additionally, the lattice match between ZnSb2O6‐x and perovskite facilitates well‐ordered perovskite film growth. As a result, PSCs featuring ZnSb2O6‐x ETLs achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 25.02% and retained 90.62% of their initial performance after 1000 h under the ISOS‐D‐2 protocol. Furthermore, devices demonstrated remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 83.69% of their original performance after 800 h of maximum power point tracking at 85 °C, meeting the stringent ISOS‐L‐2 protocol requirements.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work introduces a programmable photonic analog‐to‐digital converter (ADC), leveraging phase‐change materials (PCMs) and foundry‐based silicon photonics. 2‐ and 4‐bit ADCs with zero quantization energy are achieved by the programmable and non‐volatile nature of PCMs. The photonic ADC can reach a resolution of 8‐bit with 65‐state PCMs. An all‐optical analog‐to‐digital conversion is successfully demonstrated, marking a significant advancement in efficient high‐speed photonic processing.








Abstract
High‐performance signal processing and telecommunication systems absolutely necessitate analog‐to‐digital converters (ADCs) that offer extensive bandwidth, exceptional precision, and minimal power consumption, in order to efficiently convert real‐world analog signals into digital signals. While current electronic ADCs are constrained by limitations such as low bandwidth, high jitter noise, susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, and excessive energy consumption, photonic ADCs present promising solutions to overcome these challenges. Here, a programmable photonic ADC is developed by integrating phase‐change materials (PCMs) with silicon photonics fabricated using foundry processes. Thanks to the programmability and non‐volatile nature of PCMs, 2‐ and 4‐bit photonic ADCs are demonstrated on a single chip, achieving zero energy consumption during the quantization. Through the experimental demonstration of 65‐state PCMs, photonic ADCs can attain a resolution of 8‐bit, marking a significant milestone as the highest resolution reported to date for ADCs leveraging optical technologies. As a proof of concept, an all‐optical analog‐to‐digital conversion system is demonstrated by integrating 2‐bit photonic ADCs with optical sampling using a mode‐locked laser (MLL). This system achieves the conversion of a 321 MHz radio frequency (RF) signal at a sampling rate of 40 MS s−1. The programmable, energy‐efficient, and high‐speed photonic ADCs represent a significant advancement in the evolution of signal processing systems.

Abstract
Oxide interfaces have enormous potential for future electronics with many applications, such as large spin Hall conductance, phase transitions, topological states, and superconductivity. However, previous investigations have predominantly focused on gigahertz frequencies; whilst the possibilities to fabricate devices operational at terahertz frequencies are demonstrated. A model solution is proposed employing 5d rare‐earth, strontium iridate (SrIrO3) heterostructure with cobalt (Co) ultrathin layers. Femtosecond lasers are used to photoexcite the spins in Co, which super diffuse into the SrIrO3 layer to produce an ultrafast inverse spin Hall effect in sub‐picosecond timescales. The devices exploit the external magnetic field and laser fluence to control the spin polarization from the Co layer and demonstrate a tailored spin Hall effect. These results thus pave paths for next‐generation ultrafast oxide electronics offering possibilities for room temperature‐based devices.

Testing diverse biomolecules and observing their dynamic interaction in complex biological systems in a label‐free manner is critically important for THz absorption spectroscopy. A compact and multifunctional THz plasmonic biosensing platform by leveraging multiple interfering resonances from quasi‐bound states in the continuum designed to noninvasively and in situ track the temporal evolution of molecules in multiple analyte systems is proposed.








Abstract
Testing diverse biomolecules and observing their dynamic interaction in complex biological systems in a label‐free manner is critically important for terahertz (THz) absorption spectroscopy. However, traditionally employed micro/nanophotonic techniques suffer from a narrow operating resonance and strong absorption band interference from polar solutions preventing seriously reliable, on‐demand biosensor integration. Here, a multifunctional THz plasmonic biosensing platform by leveraging multiple interfering resonances from quasi‐bound states in the continuum designed to noninvasively and in situ track the temporal evolution of molecules in multiple analyte systems, is proposed. In contrast to conventional microphotonic sensors, this platform demonstrates substantially broadband performance and reduced footprints, allowing for simultaneous detection of diverse molecular vibrant at multiple spectral points through robust near‐field interactions. Furthermore, this sensor enables real‐time analysis of amino acid absorption as water evaporates despite its strong overlapping absorption bands in the THz range. By utilizing the real‐time format of the reflectance method to acquire a comprehensive spectro‐temporal data collection, this approach supports developing a deep neural network to discriminate and predict the composition and proportion of multiple mixtures, obviating the need for frequency scanning or microfluidic devices. This approach offers innovative viewpoints for exploring biological processes and provides valuable tools for biological analysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 vdWH heterostructure polarized photodetector is introduced, which possesses the capability to simultaneously measure both the linear polarization angle and the degree of polarization. This device demonstrates bias‐switchable polarization detection over a wide spectral range, and exhibits a bipolar photoresponse even at zero bias. Taking advantage of these unique properties, the photodetector has been successfully applied in imaging scenarios and has also been simulated for use in dual coding communication.








Abstract
On‐chip polarized photodetectors play a crucial role in advancing ultra‐compact optoelectronic devices for next‐generation technologies. However, simultaneously detecting the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) and the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) within a single device remains a challenging task, particularly due to the inherently weak polarization states found in naturally anisotropic materials. In this paper, it is reported on the development of a twisted monopole barrier photodetector based on a PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 configuration. This photodetector features a rapid response time of 7–12 µs. In an imaging demonstration, it operates as a single‐polarization photodetector, reconstructing AoLP and DoLP distributions of target objects through bias‐switchable polarization detection across a wide spectral range, all without the plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures or polarization filters. Additionally, it demonstrates bipolar characteristics under zero‐bias conditions at room temperature, enabling dual‐binary coding for polarimetric‐encoded communication. These combination of features positions the photodetector as a highly promising candidate for on‐chip applications.

<title>Remolding the Interface Stability for Practical Aqueous Zn/I2 Batteries via Sulfonic Acid‐Rich Electrolyte and Separator Design</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The stability of the electrolyte‐electrode interface plays a crucial role in aqueous Zn/I2 batteries and is largely determined by the properties of the electrolyte and separator. Herein, a sulfonic acid‐rich electrolyte additive and separator are designed to suppress the shuttling effect and side reactions, and the electrolyte additive and separator impact the interface stability of Zn/I2 batteries is investigated.








Abstract
The electrolyte‐electrode interface plays a crucial role in aqueous Zn/I2 battery and is largely determined by the properties of electrolyte and separator. Here, the synergistic effect of sulfonic acid‐rich electrolyte additive and separator impacts the interface stability of Zn/I2 batteries is comprehensively investigated using operando synchrotron‐based Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, cryo‐electron microscopy, and in situ spectroscopy. As a case study, a cost‐effective additive known as lignosulfonic acid sodium (LAS) and a flexible sulfonated polyether sulfone membrane are employed to facilitate the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the Zn anode and effectively suppress the shuttle effect. The chemisorption of LAS on Zn, its interaction with Zn2+, and the impact on the Zn desolvation process are systematically investigated through both theoretical simulations and operando measurements. Furthermore, the formation of an in situ SEI consisting of ZnS and ZnF2 is identified, which facilitates the uniform nucleation and planar plating of Zn(002), while effectively suppressing detrimental side reactions. Additionally, visualization experiments and in situ spectroscopy confirm that R−SO3− groups effectively impede the shuttle process of I3−/I5− anions through electrostatic repulsion. This work provides valuable insights for designing robust electrolyte interfaces for high‐performance aqueous Zn/I2 batteries.

<title>Superconductivity in PrNiO2 Infinite‐Layer Nickelates</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202416187?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study unveils a superconducting state in undoped parent compound PrNiO2 thin films, challenging previous views on nickelate superconductivity. Through scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques, the research demonstrates the high structural quality and distinct electronic properties of the thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. While requiring an independent verification, this result suggests that the self‐doping mechanism is sufficient for superconductivity and the reported phase diagram of infinite‐layer nickelates might need a revision.








Abstract
Several reports about infinite‐layer nickelate thin films suggest that the superconducting critical temperature versus chemical doping phase diagram has a dome‐like shape, similar to cuprates. Here, a highly reproducible superconducting state in undoped PrNiO2 thin films grown on SrTiO3 are demonstrated. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements show coherent infinite‐layer phase with no visible stacking‐fault defects, an overall high structural quality where possible unintentional chemical doping or interstitial oxygen, if present, sum well below the measurable threshold of the technique. X‐ray absorption measurements show very sharp features at the Ni L3,2‐edges with a large linear dichroism, indicating the preferential hole occupation of Ni1+‐3dx2−y2${\rm d}_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in a square planar geometry. Resonant inelastic X‐ray scattering measurements reveal sharp magnon excitations of 200 meV energy at the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, highly resonant at the Ni1 + absorption peak. The results indicate that, when properly stabilized, infinite‐layer nickelate thin films are superconducting without chemical doping.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a synergistic strategy that utilizes bidentate chelating diethyldithiocarbamate as surface ligands for cadmium‐free quantum dots (QDs), which enhances the ligand binding on the QD surface and improves stress dissipation under bending. Consequently, the resulting flexible devices exhibit peak external quantum efficiencies above 15% and retain over 90% of their initial performance after 5000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible light‐emitting diodes utilizing environmentally friendly cadmium (Cd)‐free quantum dots (QDs) hold immense potential for next‐generation wearable integrated displays. However, their overall performance lags behind Cd‐based counterparts, and less research focuses on the suitability of QD layers in flexible devices. Herein, it is observed that the traditional surface oleate ligands on QDs readily detach under device operation after cycling bending, leading to increased surface defects and accumulated tensile stress in QDs layers, further diminishing their photoluminescence and electroluminescence performance. Based on these insights, a synergetic regulation strategy is developed employing a short‐chain bidentate chelating ligand, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), to strengthen the binding of QDs with ligands, minimizing ligand detaching and consequently inhibiting the non‐radiative recombination of QDs; Meanwhile, the short‐chain DDTC also reduces the inter‐dot spatial distance and decreases the Young's modulus in QDs films, effectively dissipating stress localization and retaining the film morphology upon bending. Consequently, the resulting flexible devices based on blue ZnSeTe/ZnSe/ZnS QDs and green/red InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs demonstrate the peak external quantum efficiencies of above 15% and maintain over 90% after 5000 bending cycles, rivaling state‐of‐the‐art Cd‐based flexible devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A flexible ionic synaptic device is developed to replicate the brain's ion transport and ephaptic coupling mechanisms, enabling efficient energy consumption and complex connectivity. By using ions for signal transmission, the device achieves spatiotemporal signal integration, mimicking the computational capabilities of biological neural networks. This work advances the development of brain‐like AI systems with enhanced connectivity and processing efficiency.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices are designed to replicate the energy‐efficient information processing advantages found in biological neural networks by emulating the working mechanisms of neurons and synapses. However, most existing neuromorphic devices focus primarily on functionally mimicking biological synapses, with insufficient emphasis on ion transport mechanisms. This limitation makes it challenging to achieve the complexity and connectivity inherent in biological systems, such as ephaptic coupling. Here, an ionic biomimetic synaptic device based on a flexible ion‐gel nanofiber network is proposed, which transmits information and enables ephaptic coupling through capacitance formation by ion transport with an extremely low energy consumption of just 6 femtojoules. The hysteretic ion transport behavior endows the device with synaptic‐like memory effects, significantly enhancing the performance of the reservoir computing system for classifying the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and demonstrating high efficiency in edge learning. More importantly, the devices in an array establish communication connections, exhibiting global oscillatory behaviors similar to ephaptic coupling in biological neural networks. This connectivity enables the array to perform working memory tasks, paving the way for developing brain‐like systems characterized by high complexity and vast connectivity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A 570 meV emission shift is achieved through surface‐enhanced Landau damping during phase transitions. In crystalline Sb₂Te₃, localized surface plasmons facilitate hot‐electron injection, shifting the emission energy from 1.64 to 2.21 eV. This tunability is further enhanced by applying a DC voltage bias, making it suitable for integration with on‐chip quantum photonic systems.








Abstract
Tuning quantum emission to a specific wavelength at room temperature holds significant promise for enhancing secure quantum communication, particularly by aligning with the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum. The integration of quantum emitters with phase‐change materials enables emission wavelength modulation, especially when strong field enhancement is present. Antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) exhibits the potential to facilitate this functionality through its support of interband plasmonics and phase‐change behavior. In this study, Sb₂Te₃ antennae are designed and fabricated to tune the emission energy of adjacent perovskite quantum dots (QDs) by over 570 meV. The underlying mechanism involves the localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on Sb₂Te₃ nanostructures, which exhibit a surface‐enhanced Landau damping process that facilitates the decay of LSPs into electron‐hole pairs. The generated hot electrons are then injected into perovskite QDs via the microscopic electron transport process, which can be triggered by the transition of Sb2Te3 from amorphous to a crystalline state, resulting in a significant emission energy shift from 1.64 to 2.21 eV. Furthermore, the emission energy of perovskite QDs on crystalline Sb₂Te₃ nanoantennae can be modulated through DC voltage bias, highlighting the potential for extensive wavelength tunability of quantum emitters integrated with electronic systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Three morphologies of spinel catalysts for the decomposition of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are prepared by hydrothermal method. The optimization of morphology made a positive impact on PET conversion, yield of bis(2‐hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), and photocatalytic performance. Catalyst with octahedral morphology has an optimum content of oxygen vacancies, which can work as active sites to promote PET degradation.








Abstract
Thermocatalytic recycling of plastics is typically constrained by high energy input requirements, resulting in poor economic efficiency and necessitating the utilization of light power. Indeed, photothermal catalysis offers several advantages over traditional photocatalysis and enables more efficient use of light energy. In this study, unique octahedral spinel‐structured cobalt manganese oxide (CoMn2O4) catalysts are prepared. CoMn2O4 acts as both a photothermal reagent and catalyst, demonstrating low light intensity requirements, high conversion rates, enhanced reactivity, and superior stability during polyethylene terephthalate (PET) glycolysis via photothermocatalysis. Oxygen vacancies created on CoMn2O4 facilitate PET glycolysis by providing reactive sites that promote nucleophilic addition and subsequent elimination reactions. The spinel structure of CoMn2O4 ensures high thermal stability, while the octahedral configuration enhances the optical absorption coefficient and photothermal conversion efficiency. Under identical conditions, the PET conversion efficiency of CoMn2O4 in photothermal catalysis is 3.1 times higher than under purely thermal conditions, while maintaining high selectivity for high‐value monomers. This study presents a new catalyst design approach for highly efficient upcycling of plastics, highlighting its substantial potential in this field.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An in situ polymerization strategy is rationally proposed to synthesize cross‐linked polymer solid‐state electrolyte and polymer‐encapsulated graphite cathode, which achieves intimate interface contact, dendrite free, flame retardancy, and confined volume expansion, enabling a solid‐state aluminum‐graphite battery with high‐areal‐capacity, high‐safety, and long‐lasting lifespan.








Abstract
Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) attract intense interest due to their low‐cost, high‐capacity, and high‐safety using nonflammable chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs). However, Al dendrite growth, interface degradation, and corrosiveness remain challenges in these ILEs. Herein, an ultrastable solid‐state aluminum battery (SAB) based on a cross‐linked polymer solid‐state electrolyte (PSE) and a PSE‐encapsulated graphite (PG) cathode is constructed via an in situ polymerization strategy, which maintains battery safety and realizes a synergy of interface compatibility between PSE/PG and PSE/Al interfaces. The PSE has a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 4.15 × 10−3 S cm−1 and a low corrosiveness to Al anode, ensuring rapid and continuous transportation of chloroaluminate ions and homogeneous plating/stripping of metallic Al. In addition, the volume expansion of the PG cathode is almost negligible owing to the confinement effect of graphite within the cross‐linked polymer skeleton. As a consequence, the assembled SAB demonstrates high areal capacity (0.67 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2), good rate performance, and impressive cycling stability (no capacity attenuation after 10 000 cycles). Such in situ polymerization strategy shows a broader promise for the development of safe and stable RABs in energy storage applications.

Abstract
2D materials possess exceptional carrier transport properties and mechanical stability despite their ultrathin nature. In this context, the coupling between polarization fields and photoelectric fields has been proposed to modulate the physical properties of 2D materials, including energy band structure, carrier mobility, as well as the dynamic processes of photoinduced carriers. These strategies have led to significant improvements in the performance, functionality, and integration density of 2D materials ‐based photodetectors. The present review introduces the coupling of photoelectric field with four fundamental polarization fields, delivered from dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric effects, focusing on their synergistic coupling mechanisms, distinctive properties, and technological merits in advanced photodetection applications. More importantly, it sheds light on the new path of material synthesis and novel structure design to improve the efficiency of the coupling strategies in photodetectors. Then, research advances on the synergy of multi‐polarization effects and photoelectric effect in the domain of bionic photodetectors are highlighted. Finally, the review outlines the future research perspectives of coupling strategies in 2D materials‐based photodetectors and proposes potential solutions to address the challenges issues of this area. This comprehensive overview will guide futural fundamental and applied research that capitalizes on coupling strategies for sensitive and intelligent photodetection.

<title>Double‐Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Dynamic Strength of over 90 GPa Enhanced by Intershell Friction</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202414643?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The ultraviolet laser irradiation is used to cut off the outer shell of double‐walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). A velocity‐dependent intershell friction occurs between the outer and inner shells. This friction results from dynamic localized commensurate contacts. The friction‐induced intershell locking enhances the dynamic strength of DWCNTs to over 90 GPa, indicating that DWCNTs possess exceptional resistance to high‐velocity impacts.








Abstract
Low‐dimensional ultra‐strong nanomaterials have attracted great anticipation for applications under extreme dynamic conditions. A photocatalytic method is developed to selectively cut off the outer shell of double‐walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), achieving non‐contact measurement of intershell friction with both high temporal and spatial resolutions at high sliding velocities under optical microscope. The intershell friction linearly increases with the sliding velocity, with a slope related to intershell distance and chirality of DWCNTs. The maximum measured friction reaches 194.1 ± 7.3 nN at a sliding velocity of 977 mm s−1, a value comparable to the tensile force (≈450 nN) for breaking the outer shell. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the velocity‐dependent intershell friction is related to dynamic localized commensurate contacts. The friction‐induced “intershell locking” enhances the effective dynamic strength of DWCNTs from 64.8 ± 3.4 GPa to 90.1 ± 4.0 GPa at a tensile strain rate of 3300 s−1. This study reveals anomalous friction mechanisms at nanoscale and demonstrates promising application of DWCNTs as ultra‐strong materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By proposing a single‐cell order‐decoupling method and simultaneously manipulating four‐dimensional optical parameters (Wavelength, Wavevector Direction, Polarization, and Diffraction Order), a meta‐optics storage system accomplishes multidimensional optical encryption. This system achieves up to sixteen‐channel multidimensional encrypted holographic images with high quality and exponentially raises the threshold of brute‐force decoding, and thus remarkably enhances information security in optical storage.









Abstract
Recent advancements in multidimensional multiplexing have paved the way for meta‐optics encryption to be a viable solution to next‐generation information storage and encryption security. However, challenges persist in increasing simultaneously modulated dimensions while minimizing structural complexity. Here, a novel single‐cell order‐decoupling method is proposed for the realization of a multidimensional encrypted meta‐optics storage system. By analyzing the mathematic relationships between the phases of different diffraction orders, the detour phase structure is optimized to achieve independent encoding freedom for multiple orders. The proposed multidimensional encrypted meta‐optics successfully realize the concurrent modulation of four optical dimensions: i) Wavelength, ii) Wavevector Direction, iii) Polarization, and iv) Diffraction Order. The system achieves up to sixteen‐channel meta‐holograms with low crosstalk and exponentially raises the threshold of brute‐force decoding and thus remarkably enhances the information security in optical storage. It envisioned that the on‐chip metasurface‐based multidimensional encrypted strategy for augmented reality display functionalities presents promising applications in optical encryption/storage, anti‐counterfeiting, and multifunctional photonics integrated circuits.

When water drops slide on hydrophobic surfaces, they spontaneously leave behind negative charges along their path, resulting in the drops becoming positively charged. Here, it is shown that this phenomenon, known as slide electrification, influences the deposition of charged dissolved molecules. Using charged fluorophores and biomolecules, a preferential deposition of cations along the drop's trail is demonstrated, following the charge distribution pattern.








Abstract
It has been discovered during the last decade that when water drops slide on hydrophobic surfaces, they spontaneously leave negative charges along the drop path. The drops become positively charged with a potential of 1 kV. This process, called slide electrification, influences drop motion and alters contact angles. Here, a third effect of slide electrification is demonstrated: the preferential deposition of dissolved solutes with positive charges. To illustrate this, water drops containing dissolved charged fluorophore ions are allowed to slide down a tilted hydrophobic surface, and their track is imaged. Two perylene derivatives are applied as fluorophores, one chromophore carrying positive charges, PDI+, and one carrying negative charges, PDI─. PDI+ is deposited at a concentration as low as 0.5 µm. In contrast, PDI─ is only deposited above 5 µm. Experiments using grounded drops or a hydrophobic coating on a conducting substrate indicate that the electric field generated from the negative surface charges behind the drop causes a preferential deposition of the dissolved ions near the interface. This hypothesis also agrees with Kelvin probe measurements. Complex biomolecules deposition e.g. DNA can be also affected by this. These findings contribute to a better understanding of mass transfer processes at interfaces.

<title>In Situ Grown RuNi Alloy on ZrNiNx as a Bifunctional Electrocatalyst Boosts Industrial Water Splitting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Bimetallic nitrides supported RuNi alloy (RuNi/ZrNiNx) epitaxial heterostructure as a bifunctional catalyst achieves highly stable and active hydrogen and oxygen evolution at ampere‐scale current densities. Charge redistribution induced high‐valence Zr promotes the water dissociation, electron‐deficient Ru facilitates H desorption, and the hollow site of tri‐coordinated Ni in NiNx that is adjacent to Zr atom favors the energetically favorable O2 production.








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis represents a pivotal technology for green hydrogen production yet faces critical challenges including limited current density and high energy input. Herein, a heterostructured bimetallic nitrides supported RuNi alloy (RuNi/ZrNiNx) is developed through in situ epitaxial growth under ammonolysis, achieving exceptional bifunctional activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 m KOH electrolyte. The RuNi/ZrNiNx exhibits a HER current density of −2 A cm−2 at an overpotential of 392.8 mV, maintaining initial overpotential after 1000 h continuous electrolysis at −500 mA cm−2. For OER, it delivers a current density of 2 A cm−2 at 1.822 V versus RHE, and sustains stable operation for 705 h at 500 mA cm−2. Experimental and theoretical studies unveil that the charge redistribution‐induced high‐valence Zr centers effectively polarize H─O bonds and promote water dissociation, and the electron‐deficient interface Ru sites optimize hydrogen desorption kinetics. Dynamic OH spillovers from Zr sites to the adjacent tri‐coordinated Ni hollow sites in NiNx promote rapid *OH intermediate desorption and active site regeneration. Notably, the tri‐coordinated Ni hollow sites in NiNx proximal to Zr atoms exhibit tailored adsorption strength for oxo‐intermediates, enabling a more energetically favorable pathway for O2 production.

<title>Upconversion Nanoparticle‐Covalent Organic Framework Core–shell Particles as Therapeutic Microrobots Trackable With Optoacoustic Imaging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upconversion nanoparticle‐covalent organic framework core–shell particles provide enhanced contrast for optoacoustic imaging by leveraging the optical absorption of upconversion luminescence within the covalent organic framework matrix. Beyond their role as contrast agents, these particles enable customizable therapeutic agent loading and release, as well as magnetic microrobotic steering within vascular environments.








Abstract
Despite the development of various medical imaging contrast agents, integrating contrast signal generation with therapeutic and microrobotic functions remains challenging without complicated fabrication processes. In this study, upconversion nanoparticle‐covalent organic framework (UCNP‐COF) core–shell sub‐micron particles are developed that function as therapeutic microrobots trackable with multi‐spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and can be loaded with desired therapeutic molecular agents in a customizable manner. The mechanism of optoacoustic signal generation in UCNP‐COF particles is attributed to the quenching of upconversion luminescence emitted by the UCNPs, which is absorbed by the encapsulating COF and subsequently converted into acoustic waves. Unlike other microparticulate agents previously imaged with MSOT, UCNP‐COF particles do not pose concerns about their stability and biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the mesoporous texture of the COF provides a large surface area, allowing for the efficient loading of various drug molecules, which can be released at target sites. Furthermore, the magnetic UCNP‐COF Janus particles can be magnetically navigated through in vivo vasculature while being visualized in real‐time with volumetric MSOT. This study proposes an approach to design photonic materials with multifunctionality, enabling high‐performance medical imaging, drug delivery, and microrobotic manipulation toward their future potential clinical use.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A strongly coupled multisite anode electrocatalyst with cluster‐scale ruthenium‐tungsten oxide (Ru‐WOx) interface is developed for alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), which could simultaneously achieve high coverage of hydroxyl (OHad) and hydrogen (Had) at Ru and WOx domains, respectively. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm−2 with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mgRu cm−2 and outstanding durability.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is a more cost‐effective alternative to platinum anode catalysts for alkaline anion‐exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), but suffers from severe competitive adsorption of hydrogen (Had) and hydroxyl (OHad). To address this concern, a strongly coupled multisite electrocatalyst with highly active cluster‐scale ruthenium‐tungsten oxide (Ru‐WOx) interface, which could eliminate the competitive adsorption phenomenon and achieve high coverage of OHad and Had at Ru and WOx domains, respectively, is designed. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that WOx domain functions as a proton sponge to perpetually accommodate the activated hydrogen species that spillover from the adjacent Ru domain, and the resulting WO‐Had species are readily coupled with Ru‐OHad at the heterointerface to finish the hydrogen oxidation reaction with faster kinetics via the thermodynamically favorable Tafel‐Volmer mechanism. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm−2 with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mgRu cm−2 and outstanding durability (negligible voltage decay over 80‐h operation at 500 mA cm−2). This work offers completely new insights into understanding the alkaline HOR mechanism and designing advanced anode catalysts for AEMFCs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The heart organoid model exhibits the acidic microenvironment characteristic of myocardial infarction, which emerges as a pivotal force propelling the movement of micro‐robots. These micro‐robots, administered through microneedles, can penetrate deep into the tissue, effectively delivering therapeutic payloads to facilitate heart repair.








Abstract
Post‐myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro‐robot mounted micro‐needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI‐acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF‐laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

<title>Tribenzyl Organic Cations Carried Multidentate X‐Type Lewis Soft Base for High‐Performance Foldable Perovskite Light‐Emitting Diodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study proposes tribenzyl organic cation carried multidentate X‐type Lewis soft base to enhance adhesion and passivate defects simultaneously, aiming to achieve foldable and efficient perovskite nanocrystal‐based light‐emitting diodes. The resulting pure red F‐PeLEDs exhibit a recorded high EQE of 16.2% and robust mechanical properties to endure 5000 folding cycles with small radius of 1 mm.








Abstract
Lead‐halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibit significant potential for advancing foldable perovskite light‐emitting diodes (F‐PLEDs) due to their discrete crystalline morphology, bright emission across an extensive color gamut, and remarkable color purity; however, their progression remains in the early stages with the concerns of inadequate performance and mechanical instability. This study proposes a ligand strategy employing tribenzyl organic cation (tribenzylamine, TBA) carried multidentate X‐type Lewis soft base (sodium acid pyrophosphate, SAPP) to address the challenges above simultaneously. Specifically, the use of multibranched aromatic ligands considerably improved the adhesion force between PNCs and adjacent layers, enhancing mechanical stability during folding, while the control sample shows deleterious cracks. Additionally, TBA‐SAPP ligands effectively eliminate the defects in PNC film, yielding exceptional photoluminescence properties with a near‐unity quantum yield. Consequently, the multifunctional ligands improved F‐PLEDs to achieve a record‐high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16.2% compared to the previously reported pure‐red flexible PLEDs and display substantially improved spectral and operational stability. Equally important, these devices demonstrate robust mechanical properties, enduring a small folding radius of 1 mm for 5000 cycles. This ligand strategy is anticipated to inspire relevant research in PNCs and promote the realization of highly efficient and mechanically stable F‐PLEDs.

<title>Unveiling the Origin of Oxygen Framework Stability in Ultra‐High Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419856?af=R</link>
<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202419856?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of oxygen framework stability is studied by integrating high covalent element Mo into the bulk and surface of ultra‐high nickel cathode materials through a one‐step method. Mo with strong covalency can suppress Li/Ni antisite defects and reduce Li‐O‐Li configurations, thus suppressing irreversible phase transition and stabilizing the oxygen framework structure at high voltage.








Abstract
Ultra‐high nickel layered oxides are recognized as promising cathode candidates for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries due to their enhanced overall capacity and elevated operating voltage. However, the interlayer sliding of transition metal‐oxygen octahedra (TMO6) and the instability of lattice oxygen at high voltages for ultra‐high nickel oxide cathodes pose significant challenges to their development. Herein, the origin of oxygen framework stability is investigated by incorporating high‐covalent element Mo in both bulk and surface using a one‐step integrated method for ultra‐high nickel cathode material LiNi0.92Co0.08O2. It is revealed that apart from the isolation and protection effect of the Mo‐enriched surface layer, the suppression of Li/Ni antisite defects by Mo6+ with strong covalency in the bulk plays a critical role in reducing the configurations of the activated anionic redox reaction and stabilizing the lattice oxygen and oxygen framework structure. Benefiting from this, the reversibility of anionic redox reaction and the stability of oxygen framework is significantly enhanced, enabling more oxidized oxygen to exist in the form of oxygen dimer ions O2n−$O_2^{n - }$ rather than being lost as gaseous O2. Consequently, the modified ultra‐high nickel material demonstrates improved diffusion kinetics and optimized electrochemical performance at high voltage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Acid etching assisted direct upcycling strategy that selectively removals rock‐salt phases on the surface of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and dissociating polycrystalline structure to single crystals simultaneously, facilitating direct repair of its composition and structure via simple solid‐state sintering. The regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits comparable capacity and more excellent electrochemical stability to commercialized ones.








Abstract
Direct recycling of cathode materials has attracted phenomenal attention due to its economic and eco‐friendly advantages. However, existing direct recycling technologies are difficult to apply to highly degraded layered materials as the accumulation of thick rock‐salt phases on their surfaces not only blocks lithiation channels but also is thermodynamically difficult to transform into layered phases. Here, a surface engineering‐assisted direct upcycling strategy that reactivates the lithium diffusion channels at the highly degraded cathode surfaces using acid etching explored. Acid can selectively remove the electrochemically inert rock‐salt phases on the surface while simultaneously dissociating the degraded polycrystalline structure to single crystals, thereby reducing the thermodynamic barrier of the relithiation process and enhancing the stability of the regenerated cathode. This strategy can restore the capacity of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 from 59.7 to 165.4 mAh g−1, comparable to that of commercialized ones. The regenerated cathode also exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with a capacity retention of 80.1% at 1 C after 500 cycles within 3.0–4.2 V (vs graphite) in pouch‐type full cells. In addition, the generality of this strategy has also been validated on Ni‐rich layered materials and LiCoO2. This work presents a promising approach for direct recycling of highly degraded cathode materials.

A novel 3D printing method enables the fabrication of materials with precisely controlled mechanical properties at nanoscale resolution. A volume‐conserving photoresist combined with the free and open‐source software, OpenScribe, achieves mechanical transitions over 770 nanometers ‐ representing a 130‐fold improvement over existing approaches. This advancement enables the creation of complex materials with unprecedented control over local elasticity.








Abstract
Fabrication methods that synthesize materials with higher precision and complexity at ever smaller scales are rapidly developing. Despite such advances, generating complex 3D materials with controlled mechanical properties at the nanoscale remains challenging. Exerting precise control over mechanical properties at the nanoscale would enable material strengths near theoretical maxima, and the replication of natural structures with hitherto unattainable strength‐to‐weight ratios. Here, a method for fabricating materials with nanovoxelated elastic moduli by employing a volume‐conserving photoresist composed of a copolymer hydrogel, along with OpenScribe, an open‐source software that enables the precise programming of material mechanics, is presented. Combining these, a material composed of periodic unit cells featuring heteromechanically tessellated soft‐stiff structures, achieving a mechanical transition over an order‐of‐magnitude change in elastic modulus within 770 nm, a 130‐fold improvement on previous reports, is demonstrated. This work critically advances material design and opens new avenues for fabricating materials with specifically tailored properties and functionalities through unparalleled control over nanoscale mechanics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel non‐fullerene acceptor, BFDO‐4F, is integrated into organic photodetectors (OPDs) to enable electron trapping. The resulting devices exhibit dual‐mode functionality, with bias‐switchable operation between photovoltaic (PV) and photomultiplication (PM) modes. An on‐chip module is demonstrated, where the PV section supplies bias for the PM section achieving self‐powered amplifier‐free system, highlighting the potential for multifunctional OPDs in advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photomultiplication‐type organic photodetectors (PM‐OPDs) provide for signal amplification, ideal for detecting faint light, and simplifying detection systems. However, current designs often suffer from slow response speed and elevated dark current. Conversely, photovoltaic‐type organic photodetectors (PV‐OPDs) provide fast response and high specific detectivity (D*) but have limited photoresponse. This study presents the synthesis and incorporation of a non‐fullerene acceptor, BFDO‐4F, into the active layer to introduce trap states for capturing photogenerated electrons. The resulting device exhibits dual‐mode characteristic and is bias‐switchable between PV and PM‐modes. In PV‐mode, the OPDs achieve high D* of 1.92 × 10¹2 Jones and a response time of 2.83/4.43 µs. In PM‐mode, the OPDs exhibit exceptional external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 3484% and a D* of up to 1.13 × 10¹2 Jones. An on‐chip self‐powered module with PV‐mode pixels driving a PM‐mode pixel is demonstrated, yielding a photocurrent approximately five times higher than the reference device. This approach paves the way for developing multifunctional bias‐switchable dual‐mode on‐chip OPDs, suitable for various applications.

<title>Machine Learning Relationships Between Nanoporous Structures and Electrochemical Performance in MOF Supercapacitors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study constructs a unified supercapacitor database comprising hundreds of MOF electrodes based on constant‐potential molecular simulation. The relationships between porous structures and electrochemical performance are thoroughly examined through interpretable machine learning techniques, with molecular insights by analyzing in‐pore electrode‐ion coordination and ion diffusion. These findings pave the way for the design and optimization of advanced electrode materials.









Abstract
The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, constant‐potential molecular simulation is used to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal–organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well‐trained decision‐tree‐based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode‐ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D‐pore and 3D‐pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D‐pore and 3D‐pore MOFs. Especially for 3D‐pore MOFs, an exponential increase in porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in‐pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing. These findings provide profound insights for the design of high‐performance supercapacitor electrodes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a breakthrough in wave manipulation physics and technology, enabling perfect absorption and precise wavefront control. The proposed concept of metagrating surpasses the size and efficiency limitations of conventional ones. Its compact, lightweight design tackles the key challenge inherent to all elastic wave‐manipulation metastructures, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their implementation in real‐world applications.








Abstract
Optical and acoustic metagratings have addressed the challenges of low‐efficiency wave manipulation and high‐complexity fabrication associated with metamaterials and metasurfaces. In this research, the concept of locally resonant elastic metagrating (LREM) is both theoretically and experimentally demonstrated, which is underpinned by the unique elastic impedance modulation and the hybridization of intrinsic evanescent waves. Remarkably, the LREM overcomes the size limitations of conventional metagratings and offers a distinctive design paradigm for highly efficient, compact, and lightweight structures for wave manipulation in elastic wave systems. Importantly, the LREM tackles a key challenge inherent to all elastic wave‐manipulation metastructures, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their real‐world applications.

<title>Localized Electrolyte Grain Engineering to Suppress Li Intrusion in All‐Solid‐State Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, a highly scalable chemical approach based on the anion exchange reaction is developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite‐type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion.








Abstract
Li intrusion is the primary factor contributing to the undesirable cycling durability and rate capability of all‐solid‐state lithium metal batteries. However, conventional engineering methodologies for solid electrolytes (SEs) that focus on crystalline scales, such as doping, have limited efficacy in addressing this issue, as they not only involve cumbersome trial‐and‐error processes but also struggle to simultaneously optimize the multiple macroscopic properties necessary for effectively suppressing Li intrusion. Herein, rather than following the conventional practice of SE engineering, it is concentrated on optimizing SEs at the grain‐aggregate level. A highly scalable chemical approach based on a thermodynamic‐favored anion exchange reaction is first developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite‐type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion. The localized grain‐engineered electrolyte aggregates greatly enhance Li reversibility and are able to suppress Li intrusion under practical working conditions. Notably, the 20 µm‐Li||LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cell using localized grain‐engineered electrolyte aggregates can stably cycle for over 2000 cycles at a high current density of 1.6 mA cm−2.

<title>LiF‐Rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphases Homogenizing Li+ Fluxes toward Stable Interface in Li‐Rich Mn‐Based Cathodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel vapor phase method is first proposed to reconstruct a robust LiF coating layer on the Li‐rich Mn‐based oxide cathodes. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF‐rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes on the electrode surface, contributing to a stable electrode‐electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode‐electrolyte interphase (CEI) is crucial to enhance the battery performance of Li‐rich Mn‐based oxide (LMO) cathodes. To achieve an ideal CEI, a gas‐phase fluorination technique is proposed to pre‐structure a robust LiF layer (≈1 nm) on the LMO surface. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface and mitigates undesirable side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF‐rich CEI layer on the LMO‐F‐1. The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes across the electrode surface and enhances Li+ diffusion in the electrode during (de)intercalation, contributing to a stable electrode‐electrolyte interface. Moreover, the robust LiF‐rich CEI layer effectively suppresses the decomposition of lithium salts in the electrolyte and reduces autocatalytic side reactions triggered by the by‐products. In addition, it improves the structural stability of LMO by increasing the formation energies of oxygen and manganese vacancies. As a result, the modified LMO with the LiF‐rich CEI retains 95% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical stability. The proposed gas‐phase Li+ flux homogenization strategy offers a promising avenue for enhancing the interface stability of high‐voltage cathode materials with lithium storage.

The gasotransmitter‐nanodonor FSG@AB co‐releases hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and glucose oxidase (GOx) at bone metastases, disrupting mitochondrial function and inhibiting glycolysis to deplete tumor energy sources, exerting robust anti‐tumor effects. The released H₂S travels to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), upregulating glutamate transporter 1 (GLT‐1) expression, reducing extracellular glutamate levels, and mitigating glutamatergic hyperactivity, ultimately alleviating anxiety‐like behaviors.








Abstract
Anxiety is highly prevalent among cancer patients, significantly impacting their prognosis. Current cancer therapies typically lack anxiolytic properties and may even exacerbate anxiety. Here, a gasotransmitter‐nanodonors (GND) system is presented that exerts dual anxiolytic and anti‐tumor effects via a “tumor‐brain axis” strategy. The GND, synthesized by co‐embedding Fe2⁺ and S2⁻ ions along with glucose oxidase (GOx) within bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (FSG@AB), enables the controlled release of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in the acidic tumor microenvironment. H₂S and GOx synergistically deplete tumor energy sources, resulting in robust anti‐tumor effects. Meanwhile, H₂S generated at the tumor site is transported through the bloodstream to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the brain, where it modulates neuronal activity. Specifically, in the ACC, H₂S upregulates glutamate transporter 1 (GLT‐1), which reduces extracellular glutamate levels and attenuates the hyperactivity of glutamatergic neurons, thereby alleviating anxiety‐like behavior. This study proposes a GND system that targets both oncological and psychiatric dimensions of cancer through the “tumor‐brain axis” strategy, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes.

The miniaturized and portable bio‐battery, fabricated by 3‐D printing of living hydrogels containing electroactive Shewanella oneidensis MR‐1 biofilms, represents a novel class of engineered living energy materials. The electricity generated by this device can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals.








Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio‐batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio‐battery orchestrating off‐the‐shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio‐battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3‐D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20 mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio‐battery with self‐charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio‐battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio‐energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

Research on the flexible bio‐inspired cognitive systems, classified into near‐ and in‐sensor computing, is addressed. Fundamental aspects, including biological processes, required components, and the device types for each component, as well as applications for wearable systems, are discussed. Additionally, perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics are provided.








Abstract
Flexible neuromorphic architectures that emulate biological cognitive systems hold great promise for smart wearable electronics. To realize neuro‐inspired sensing and computing electronics, artificial sensory neurons that detect and process external stimuli must be integrated with central nervous systems capable of parallel computation. In near‐sensor computing, synaptic devices, and sensors are used to emulate sensory neurons and receptors, respectively. In contrast, in in‐sensor computing, a single multifunctional device serves as both the receptor and neuron. Bio‐inspired cognitive systems efficiently detect and process stimuli through data structuring techniques, significantly reducing data volume and enabling the extension of neuromorphic applications to smart wearable systems. To construct wearable near‐ and in‐sensor computing, it is crucial to develop artificial sensory neurons and central nervous synapses that replicate the biological functionalities. Additionally, the integrated systems must exhibit high mechanical flexibility and integration density. This review addresses research on flexible bio‐inspired cognitive systems, classified into near‐ and in‐sensor computing. It covers fundamental aspects, including biological cognitive processes, the required components, and the structures for each component, as well as applications for wearable smart systems. Finally, it offers perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics in smart wearable systems connected to the next‐generation Internet of Things.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review provides a comprehensive overview of deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies for single‐atom catalysts (SACs), identifying five deactivation pathways across seven destabilization scenarios and detailing three key regeneration strategies. It introduces advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques relevant to these processes. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing stable and efficient SACs for energy applications.








Abstract
Numerous in situ characterization studies have focused on revealing the catalytic mechanisms of single‐atom catalysts (SACs), providing a theoretical basis for their rational design. Although research is relatively limited, the stability of SACs under long‐term operating conditions is equally important and a prerequisite for their real‐world energy applications, such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Recently, there has been a rise in in situ characterization studies on the destabilization and regeneration of SACs; however, timely and comprehensive summaries that provide the catalysis community with valuable insights and research directions are still lacking. This review summarizes recent advances in the destabilization mechanisms and regeneration strategies of SACs, specifically highlighting various state‐of‐the‐art characterization techniques employed in the studies. The factors that induce destabilization in SACs are identified by discussing the failure of active sites, coordination environments, supports, and reaction conditions under long‐term operating scenarios. Next, the primary regeneration strategies for SACs are introduced, including redispersion, surface poison desorption, and exposure of subsurface active sites. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of both in situ and ex situ characterization techniques are discussed. Finally, future research directions are proposed, aimed at constructing structure–stability relationships and guiding the design of more stable SACs.

To further overcome the pharmacological limitations of metal complexes, the multifunctional nanomaterials are developed. This review introduces the self‐assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles of various shapes, the mechanism of self‐assembly, and their applications in biomedical fields such as detection, imaging, and antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Cisplatin is widely used in clinical cancer treatment; however, its application is often hindered by severe side effects, particularly inherent or acquired resistance of target cells. To address these challenges, an effective strategy is to modify the metal core of the complex and introduce alternative coordination modes or valence states, leading to the development of a series of metal complexes, such as platinum (IV) prodrugs and cyclometalated complexes. Recent advances in nanotechnology have facilitated the development of multifunctional nanomaterials that can selectively deliver drugs to tumor cells, thereby overcoming the pharmacological limitations of metal‐based drugs. This review first explores the self‐assembly of metal complexes into spherical, linear, and irregular nanoparticles in the context of biomedical applications. The mechanisms underlying the self‐assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles are subsequently analyzed, followed by a discussion of their applications in biomedical fields, including detection, imaging, and antitumor research.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts via the oxide path mechanism (OPM) is systematically reviewed. It sheds light on the rational design of OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts to break the activity‐stability trade‐offs involved in conventional OER mechanisms, leading to more efficient energy conversion and storage processes, such as water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal‐air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal‐air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen–oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by the thermal adaptability of army ant nest, an innovative textile, Army ant Nest Textile (ANT), is developed for intelligent thermal regulation and healthcare monitoring. The ANT swiftly reacts to perspiration, enhancing heat dissipation through improved radiation transmission and air exchange. Additionally, it integrates colorimetric sensors for temperature, sweat pH, and UV intensity, providing vital risk signals for users.








Abstract
A textile material that can dynamically adapt to different environments while serving as an immediate alert system for early detection of life‐threatening factors in the surroundings, not only enhances the individual's health management but also contributes to a reduction in energy consumption for space cooling and/or heating. In nature, different species have their own adaptation system to ambient temperature. Inspired by the army ant nest, herein a thermal adaptive textile known as Army ant Nest Textile (ANT) for thermal management and health monitoring is reported. This textile can promptly respond to perspiration, rapidly absorb sweat, and then transform its architecture to facilitate heat dissipation. Simultaneously, the colorimetric sensing function of ANT allows it to emulate the “site migration” behavior of the army ant nest, which empowers individuals to expeditiously identify multiple health‐related signals such as body temperature, UV radiation, and sweat pH values, and warn them to move to a secure environment, thereby effectively reducing the likelihood of physical harm. Together with its excellent scalability and biocompatibility, the ANT offers a promising direction for the development of next‐generation smart e‐textiles for personal thermal and healthcare management, while satisfying the growing demand for energy saving.

A controllable “oxygen vehicle” as a versatile nano‐carrier. For co‐delivery with lactate oxidase (LOX) significantly elevated lactate detection rates, triggering a significantly increase in IFN‐γ and T cell infiltration. Co‐delivering unmethylated cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine oligonucleotide （CpGODN） demonstrate a remarkable increase in polarization of macrophages from M2‐like to M1‐like phenotypes, DCs maturation, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia severely limits the antitumor immunotherapy for breast cancer. Although efforts to alleviate tumor hypoxia and drug delivery using diverse nanostructures achieve promising results, the creation of a versatile controllable oxygen‐releasing nano‐platform for co‐delivery with immunostimulatory molecules remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, a versatile oxygen controllable releasing vehicle PFOB@F127@PDA (PFPNPs) is developed, which effectively co‐delivered either protein drug lactate oxidase (LOX) or nucleic acids drug unmethylated cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine oligonucleotide (CpG ODNs). Upon photothermal heating, this platform triggered oxygen release, thereby augmenting LOX‐mediated lactate detection rates, and improving T cells infiltrating and cytokine expression. Moreover, under an oxygenated tumor microenvironment (TME), PFPNPs co‐delivered with CpG ODNs effectively reprogrammed the immunosuppressive TME by repolarizing macrophages to an M1‐like phenotype, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and increasing tumor‐infiltrating T cells while decreasing the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Our study demonstrated that this controlled oxygen‐releasing platform possessed adaptive drug‐loading capabilities to meet varied immunotherapeutic demands in clinical settings.

ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles self‐assemble in situ effectively and introduce mechanical force simulating primary biomechanical into the tiny target spot of TME through wireless magnetic control, which effectively inhibits tumor migration.








Abstract
Mechanical force attracts booming attention with the potential to tune the tumor cell behavior, especially in cell migration. However, the current approach for introducing mechanical input is difficult to apply in vivo. How the mechanical force affects cell behavior in situ also remains unclear. In this work, an intelligent miniaturized platform is constructed with magnetic ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) micromotors. The wireless ZFO can self‐assemble in situ and rotate to generate mechanical torque of biologically relevant piconewton‐scale at the target tumor site. It is observed unexpectedly that enhanced in situ mechanical rotating torque from ZFO micromotors and the active fluid inhibit the migration of highly invasive A549 tumor cells. The down‐regulation of the Piezo1 channel and the suppressed signaling of ROCK1 in mechano‐adaptive tumor cells is found to be related to the inhibition effect. With effectiveness confirmed with the zebrafish xenograft model, this platform provides a valuable toolkit for mechanobiology and force‐associated non‐invasive tumor therapy.

<title>On‐demand Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterial Driven by Structure Performance Relations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A rapidly and on‐demand reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial with an embedded digital interface to its structure‐performance relationships is proposed. For a given stress–strain curve, the optimal state can first be calculated based on pre‐established structure‐performance relationships. Subsequently, the state of the metamaterial can be changed using integrated soft actuators, enabling accurate and fast performance reprogramming.








Abstract
The physical reprogrammability of metamaterials provides unprecedented opportunities for tailoring changeable mechanical behaviors. It is envisioned that metamaterials can actively, precisely, and rapidly reprogram their performances through digital interfaces toward varying demands. However, on‐demand reprogramming by integration of physical and digital merits still remains less explored. Here, a real‐time reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial is reported that is guided by its own structure‐performance relations. The metamaterial consists of periodically tessellated bistable building blocks with built‐in soft actuators for state switching, exhibiting rich spatial heterogeneity. Guided by the pre‐established relations between state sequences and stress–strain curves, the metamaterial can accurately match a target curve by digitally tuning its state within 4 s. The metamaterial can be elastically tensioned and compressed under a strain of 4%, and its modulus tuning ratio reaches >30. Moreover, it also shows highly tunable shearing and bending performances. This work provides a new thought for the physical performance reprogrammability of artificial intelligent systems.

<title>Integration of Through‐Sapphire Substrate Machining with Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through‐sapphire machining is integrated with superconducting quantum processors (QPUs) and qubits. High coherence of the qubits is demonstrated as well as low parameter spread. This machining integration provides a route to further scaling of QPUs on new materials such as tantalum that are typically deposited on sapphire substrates. In addition, the machining provides a route to through‐sapphire‐vias in superconducting circuits.








Abstract
A sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate‐scale quantum processors is demonstrated. The process allows through‐substrate electrical connections, necessary for low‐frequency mode‐mitigation, as well as signal‐routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High‐coherence qubits are required to build fault‐tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low‐loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high‐coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium‐nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep‐silicon etching to create through‐substrate‐vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small‐scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high‐coherence qubits is presented. This technique immediately provides a means to scale quantum processing units (QPUs) with integrated mode‐mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through‐sapphire‐vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire‐compatible materials for large‐scale QPUs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Green and red quantum dot (QD) luminescence microspheres with simultaneous excellent color conversion performance and high photoluminescence stability are synthesized by a facile wet chemical process. They further serve as color conversion materials for the fabrication of green and red micro‐LEDs, which exhibit world‐record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1% and high brightnesses of 1.7 × 108 and 7.6 × 107 cd m−2.








Abstract
Quantum dot (QD)‐converted micrometer‐scale light‐emitting diodes (micro‐LEDs) are regarded as an effective solution for achieving high‐performance full‐color micro‐LED displays because of their narrow‐band emission, simplified mass transfer, facile drive circuits, and low cost. However, these micro‐LEDs suffer from significant blue light leakage and unsatisfactory electroluminescence properties due to the poor light conversion efficiency and stability of the QDs. Herein, the construction of green and red QD luminescence microspheres with the simultaneously high conversion efficiency of blue light and strong photoluminescence stability are proposed. These luminescence microspheres exhibit high external photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 46% under 450 nm excitation, along with excellent reliability against blue light, heat, and water‐oxygen degradation, owing to the waveguide and spatial confinement effects of the microspheres. The microsphere‐based green and red micro‐LEDs achieve world‐record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1%, respectively, and high brightness values of 1.7 × 108 and 7.6 × 107 cd m−2, respectively. Finally, 0.6 inch red, green, and blue monochrome micro‐LED displays are demonstrated by integrating microsphere‐converted micro‐LED arrays with thin‐film transistor backplanes, which show a pixel resolution as high as 1700 PPI and brightness exceeding 10 000 cd m−2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By inducing LiOTf in SnO2/ PbI2, the defects in bulk SnO2 and at the interface are passivated and stress in PbI2 is released, thus reducing the critical Gibbs free energy for mesoporous PbI2 films which leads to highly crystalline perovskite films. Ultimately, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a champion PCE of 25.33% are fabricated.








Abstract
Porous lead iodide (PbI2) film is crucial for the complete reaction between PbI2 and ammonium salts in sequential‐deposition technology so as to achieve high crystallinity perovskite film. Herein, it is found that the tensile stress in tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) is a key factor influencing the morphology and crystallization of PbI2 films. Focusing on this, lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf) is used as an interfacial modifier in the SnO2/PbI2 interface to decrease the tensile stress to reduce the necessary critical Gibbs free energy for PbI2 nuclei formation. The relaxed tensile stress facilitates the more porous PbI2 generation with larger particles and higher roughness, resulting in superior‐quality perovskite films. Besides, this strategy effectively passivates the inherent electron traps of SnO2 and smooths the interfacial energy levels, boosting the charge extraction and transfer. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.33% (25.10% stabilized for 600 s) is achieved. Furthermore, the device demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE at its maximum power point tracking measurement (under 100 mW cm−2 white light illumination at ≈55 °C temperature, in N2 atmosphere) after 600 h.

<title>A Universal Therapeutic Vaccine Leveraging Autologous Pre‐Existing Immunity to Eliminate in Situ Uniformly Engineered Heterogeneous Tumor Cells</title>

<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202412430?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The therapeutic vaccine overcomes immune evasion and resistance in diverse tumor cells by utilizing the highly immunogenic SARS‐CoV‐2 RBD antigen, enhancing antigen presentation via SUSD6 shRNA, and silencing the immune checkpoint gene PD‐L1 through shRNA. It further amplifies RBD‐specific pre‐existing immunity with adjuvant‐supported secretion of RBD‐enveloped virus‐like particles, achieving precise and effective eradication of engineered tumor cells.








Abstract
Tumor vaccines that activate the autologous immune system to eliminate tumor cells represent a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, limited antigen selection, insufficient antigen presentation, and the slow onset of de novo immune responses have resulted in poor universality and suboptimal response rates. In contrast, pathogen‐specific pre‐existing immunity acquired through infection or vaccination, can rapidly generate a more potent and enduring immune response upon re‐encounter with the same antigen. Here, an adeno‐associated virus (AAV)‐based therapeutic vaccine capable of genetically modifying diverse tumor cells to uniformly overexpress and efficiently present the highly immunogenic transmembrane SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and to release RBD‐enveloped virus‐like particles, which awaken and enhance the RBD‐specific pre‐existing immunity, leading to significant tumor remission, is engineered. Mechanistically, this therapeutic vaccine leverages the robust RBD‐specific pre‐existing immunity and heightened antibody‐mediated phagocytosis to eliminate engineered tumor cells while inducing antigen spreading, thereby provoking a more diverse tumor‐specific cellular immune responses. Notably, widespread administration of vaccines against various pathogens has provided a versatile pool of pre‐existing immunity that can be redirected to eradicate tumors. These findings offer a novel perspective on overcoming the limitations posed by tumor heterogeneity and personalized medicine.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on a unique metal‐organic core–shell coordination structure, new supercooled liquid materials successfully achieve mutually phase‐stability and controllable phase‐transition in inherent contradictory, for practical long‐term thermal energy storage.








Abstract
Mutual acquisition of phase‐stability and controllable phase‐transition becomes a predominant criterion of phase‐change materials for the practical long‐term energy storage but seems contradictory always. Here a strategy combining coordination and hydrogen bonds hierarchically to create a supercooled liquid in a core–shell coordination structure is reported, addressing that demand successfully. This new material is composed of a Mn‐methylurea complex (MM) core and the hierarchically bonded erythritols shell. MM glass core with a viscosity of 108 Pa·s determines its thermal phase‐stability. As discovered, the ingenious ligand‐exchange between erythritol and Cl− ion coordinated with MM core accounts for this effectively reversible phase‐transition. This can be triggered by a small shear‐stress of 10 Pa within tens of seconds, exhibiting good practicability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of phase‐transition are explored.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents a systematic method for the direct growth of GaN on six‐inch silicon substrates without buffers, significantly reducing GaN‐to‐substrate thermal resistance while maintaining structural quality comparable to buffered approaches. As‐grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this buffer‐less platform demonstrate state‐of‐the‐art 2D electron gas mobilities, paving the way for efficient III‐nitride transistors and advancing fundamental research on electron dynamics.








Abstract
Thick metamorphic buffers are considered indispensable for III‐V semiconductor heteroepitaxy on large lattice and thermal‐expansion mismatched silicon substrates. However, III‐nitride buffers in conventional GaN‐on‐Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) impose a substantial thermal resistance, deteriorating device efficiency and lifetime by throttling heat extraction. To circumvent this, a systematic methodology for the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on six‐inch silicon substrates is demonstrated using metal‐organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Crucial growth‐stress modulation to prevent epilayer cracking is achieved even without buffers, and threading dislocation densities comparable to those in buffered structures are realized. The buffer‐less design yields a GaN‐to‐substrate thermal resistance of (11 ± 4) m2 K GW−1, an order of magnitude reduction over conventional GaN‐on‐Si and one of the lowest on any non‐native substrate. As‐grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this template show a high‐quality 2D electron gas (2DEG) whose room‐temperature Hall‐effect mobility exceeds 2000 cm2 V−1 s−1, rivaling the best‐reported values. As further validation, the low‐temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov‐de‐Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime > 0.180 ps, and tell‐tale signatures of spin‐splitting. These results could establish a new platform for III‐nitrides, potentially enhancing the energy efficiency of power transistors and enabling fundamental investigations into electron dynamics in quasi‐2D wide‐bandgap systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Insufficient hole injection, excessive electron injection, and abundant defects on the surface of QDs are limiting the performance of blue QLEDs. An in situ patching strategy with GACl is proposed to simultaneously passivate surface defects and enhance hole injection, with the EQE increasing from 16.3% to 23.5%. The model is proposed to understand the physical mechanism of hole injection and transport.








Abstract
The poor efficiency and stability of blue Quantum Dot Light‐Emitting diodes (QLED) hinders the practical applications of QLEDs full‐color displays. Excessive electron injection, insufficient hole injection, and abundant defects on the surface of quantum dots (QD) are the main issues limiting the performance of blue devices. Herein, an in situ treatment with bipolar small molecule polydentate ligand–guanidine chloride (GACl) is proposed to simultaneously suppress excessive electron injection, patch surface defects of QDs and enhance hole injection. GACl‐treated blue QLEDs exhibited a remarkable increase in maximal external quantum Efficiency (EQE) from 16.3% to a record 23.5%, accompanied by maximal luminance (36810 cd m−2), excellent maximal current efficiency (17.5 cd A−1), and enhanced device stability. Combining C–V and J–V characteristics, a concise physical model of hole injection is also established: Below 3 V, hole injection is controlled by the interfacial barrier, primarily through tunneling and thermionic injection; Above 3 V, the interfacial barrier is eliminated, and hole injection efficiency is governed by transport within the QD layer. This study showed a clear physical model for understanding the hole injection mechanism in QLEDs, offering valuable design strategies for improving the performance of blue‐QLEDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lattice‐confined Pt1/Ni(OH)2 SACs with excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are constructed by a co‐reduction strategy. Mechanism studies disclose the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step during HER. Finally, this facile synthesis approach is extended to fabricate other 9 lattice‐confined SACs.








Abstract
The confining effect is essential to regulate the activity and stability of single‐atom catalysts (SACs), but the universal fabrication of confined SACs is still a great challenge. Here, various lattice‐confined Pt SACs supported by different carriers are constructed by a universal co‐reduction approach. Notably, Pt single atoms confined in the lattice of Ni(OH)2 (Pt1/Ni(OH)2) with a high electron‐deficient state exhibit excellent activity for basic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 just requires 15 mV to get 10 mA cm−2 and the mass activity of Pt1/Ni(OH)2 is 15 times of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 assembled in an alkaline water electrolyzer shows 1030 h durability under the industrial current density of 800 mA cm−2. In situ spectroscopy techniques reveal Pt─H and “free” OH radical can be directly observed for Pt1/Ni(OH)2, confirming the lattice‐confined Pt single atoms play a key role during HER. Further density functional theory uncovers the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, which quickly optimizes the electronic state of the Pt site, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step to 0.16 eV for HER. Finally, this synthesis method is extended to construct other 9 lattice‐confined SACs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries are determined for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 epitaxial thin films, via measurements of conventional anti‐damping torques in the high‐symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. Rotational transformations of this tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional torques for IrO2 in the lower‐symmetry orientations, with good agreement.








Abstract
Unconventional spin‐orbit torques arising from electric‐field‐generated spin currents in anisotropic materials have promising potential for spintronic applications, including for perpendicular magnetic switching in high‐density memory applications. Here, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 are determined via measurements of conventional (in‐plane) anti‐damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the high‐symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. It is then tested whether rotational transformations of this same tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional anti‐damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the lower‐symmetry (101), (110), and (111) orientations, finding good agreement. The results confirm that spin‐orbit torques from all these orientations are consistent with the bulk symmetries of IrO2, and show how simple measurements of conventional torques from high‐symmetry orientations of anisotropic thin films can provide an accurate prediction of the unconventional torques from lower‐symmetry orientations.

Inspired by the Namib Pachydactylus Rangei, a Power‐Free Cooling moisture harvester with Luneburg Lens Array is fabricated using Self‐Developed μ‐ECM process. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with Exceptional Passive sub‐Dewpoint Cooling and Efficient Harvesting Performance. Installing every 1 m2 of PFCMH can Yield ≈294.5–490.6 kg per year of water and Save ≈198.7–331.0 kWh per year of electricity.








Abstract
The development of zero‐power moisture‐harvesting technology in an unsaturated atmosphere is of great significance for coping with global freshwater scarcity. Here, inspired by Pachydactylus rangei's (Namib sand gecko) ability to evade thermal radiation and harvest moisture, a power‐free cooling moisture harvester (PFCMH) is fabricated using the continuous, industrialized micro‐extrusion compression molding. A Luneburg lens is introduced in the PFCMH for the first time, endowing it with a high reflectivity of ≈92.9% in 0.3 to the 2.5 µm waveband and emissivity of ≈98.1% in 8–13 µm waveband, which are ≈19.2% and ≈15.4% higher than those of the unstructured radiative cooler, respectively. Consequently, a temperature reduction of ≈6.9 °C is achieved. In addition, the wettability of PFCMH is well regulated, at a contact angle of ≈153° and a rolling angle of ≈42°, enabling its surface to efficiently nucleate and transport water droplets. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with exceptional passive sub‐dewpoint cooling and efficient harvesting performance. Importantly, every 1 m2 of PFCMH can yield ≈294.5–490.6 kg year−1 of water and save ≈198.7–331.0 kWh year−1 of electricity. The PFCMH offers an environmentally, power‐free, and promising solution to freshwater scarcity.

Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. This work reported a quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium‐based metal–organic frameworks (GaMOF), to capture the Methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a “captor” and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me). Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel (Me/QCSGa‐MOF@Cryogel) is fabricated for combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. Its recurrent and resistant nature, high incidence rate, long‐term hospitalization, and high medical costs have driven the efforts of the scientific community to develop new therapies to improve the situation. Considering the complex microenvironment and persistent mechanisms mediated by resistant bacteria, it is crucial to develop an implant with enhanced osseointegration and sustained and effective infection clearance effects. Here, a positively charged quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium‐based metal–organic framework (GaMOF) is designed, to capture the antibiotic‐resistant bacteria (Methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) as a “captor”, and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me) via disturbing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel loaded with the Me and QCSGaMOF is fabricated by the directional freeze‐casting method. The oriented porous structure has an enhanced osseointegration effect by guiding the ingrowth of osteogenic cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments prove the advantages of as‐prepared Me/QCSGa‐MOF@Cryogel in combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This article presents the design and characterization of first molecular ferroelectric Mott insulator, (C7H14N)3V12O30. Accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 shows a sharp change in conductivity, implying the metal–insulator transition‐like behavior. This finding opened up new possibilities for the development of strongly correlated electron systems.








Abstract
With the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance materials and high‐temperature superconductors, Mott insulators can potentially undergo a transition from insulating state to metallic state. Here, in molecular ferroelectrics system, a Mott insulator of (C7H14N)3V12O30 has been first synthesized, which is a 2D organic–inorganic ferroelectric with composition of layered vanadium oxide and quinuclidine ring. Interestingly, accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 changes sharply in conductivity. The occurrence of a Mott transition has been proven by electric transport measurements and theoretical calculations. This research has significantly expanded the applicative horizons of ferroelectric materials, and offering an ideal platform for the investigation of strongly correlated electron systems.

The optical properties of antimony make it a promising candidate for photonic memory applications due to the large contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states. This study resolves the entire switching cycle from crystal to glass and back. It elucidates the structural origin of the optical properties of the final and intermediate transient states, which are relevant for high bandwidth photonic applications.








Abstract
As a phase change material (PCM), antimony exhibits a set of desirable properties that make it an interesting candidate for photonic memory applications. These include a large optical contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states over a wide wavelength range. Switching between the states is possible on nanosecond timescales by applying short heating pulses. The glass state is reached through melting and rapid quenching through a supercooled liquid regime. While initial and final states are easily characterized, little is known about the optical properties on the path to forming a glass. Here we resolve the entire switching cycle of antimony with femtosecond resolution in stroboscopic optical pump‐probe measurements and combine the experimental results with ab‐initio molecular dynamics simulations. The glass formation process of antimony is revealed to be a complex multi‐step process, where the intermediate transient states exhibit distinct optical properties with even larger contrasts than those observed between crystal and glass. The provided quantitative understanding forms the basis for exploitation in high bandwidth photonic applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Liquid crystal elastomer films with dense nanowire arrays exhibit synergistic adhesion and shape‐changing properties. They curl toward the nanowire side under heat or chemical vapors but away from it with liquid droplets. Chemical modifications make them superoleophobic underwater, enabling precise droplet manipulation. This biomimetic design integrates enhanced adhesion with stimuli‐responsive deformation, with promising applications in soft robotics and adaptive surfaces.








Abstract
Nature provides many examples of the benefits of nanoscopic surface structures in areas of adhesion and antifouling. Herein, the design, fabrication, and characterization of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films are presented with nanowire surface structures that exhibit tunable stimuli‐responsive deformations and enhanced adhesion properties. The LCE films are shown to curl toward the side with the nanowires when stimulated by heat or organic solvent vapors. In contrast, when a droplet of the same solvent is placed on the film, it curls away from the nanowire side due to nanowire‐induced capillary forces that cause unequal swelling. This characteristic curling deformation is shown to be reversible and can be optimized to match curved substrates, maximizing adhesive shear forces. By using chemical modification, the LCE nanowire films can be given underwater superoleophobicity, enabling oil repellency under a range of harsh conditions. This is combined with the nanowire‐induced frictional asymmetry and the reversible shape deformation to create an underwater droplet mixing robot, capable of performing chemical reactions in aqueous environments. These findings demonstrate the potential of nanowire‐augmented LCE films for advanced applications in soft robotics, adaptive adhesion, and easy chemical modification, with implications for designing responsive materials that integrate mechanical flexibility with surface functionality.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) that inherit the single atomic Fe–N4 center of hemin while creating sp2‐hybridized carbon surroundings were created by a simple solvothermal treatment of hemin. HNCDs synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I, thus can significantly induce tumor pyroptosis and evoke strong antitumor immune response even under hypoxic environment.









Abstract
General synthesis and mechanical understanding of type I nano‐photosensitizers are of great importance for hypoxia‐resistant pyroptosis inducers. Herein, a simple solvothermal treatment is developed to convert non‐photosensitive small molecules (hemin) into uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) with strong type I photodynamic activity and red fluorescence emission. These HNCDs inherit the single atomic Fe–N4 center of hemin while creating sp2‐hybridized carbon surroundings, which synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I. After encapsulating HNCDs with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to facilitate in vivo applications, the resulting BSA nanoparticles (HB) can image tumors and significantly induce the pyroptosis of tumor cells even under an extremely hypoxic environment (2% O2). This evokes a strong antitumor immune response, effectively restraining tumor growth and lung metastasis in triple‐negative breast cancer mice, with good biocompatibility. This work introduces an applicable pyroptosis nano‐inducer to combat hypoxic tumors and highlights the regulation of Fe–N4 centers to develop hypoxia‐resistant type I nano‐photosensitizers for cancer treatment.

<title>Electric Field‐Induced Nonreciprocal Directional Dichroism in a Time‐Reversal‐Odd Antiferromagnet</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electric field‐induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E‐induced NDD) ascribed to the diagonal electrotoroidic effect is discovered in a time‐reversal‐odd antiferromagnet Co₂SiO₄ possessing a time‐reversal‐odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Spatial distribution measurements of E‐induced NDD reveal domain structures. Magnetic field‐induced domain inversion mediated by the piezomagnetic effect highlights the rich physics of time‐reversal‐odd antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with broken time‐reversal (T$\mathcal{T}$) symmetry (T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet‐like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet‐like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T$\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in such a system, a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field‐induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E‐induced NDD), is employed. Signals of E‐induced NDD are successfully detected in a T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd antiferromagnet, Co₂SiO₄, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E‐induced NDD, spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T$\mathcal{T}$ operation are visualized. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. The observation of E‐induced NDD highlights unique functionalities of T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd antiferromagnets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High‐modulus homochiral Al2O3 yarn artificial muscles with a different actuation mechanism containing volume expansion and topological structure transformation are fabricated. Under an electric drive, the torsional muscle provides a high actuation stress of 483.5 MPa, a large energy density of 9.8 J g−1, and a high output power of 10.3 W g−1, while maintaining a large stroke of 13.5%.








Abstract
Fiber‐based artificial muscles are soft actuators used to mimic the movement of human muscles. However, using high modulus oxide ceramics to fabricate artificial muscles with high energy and power is a challenge as they are prone to brittle fracture during torsion. Here, a ceramic metallization strategy is reported that solves the problem of low torsion and low ductility of alumina (Al2O3) ceramics by chemical plating a thin copper layer on alumina filaments. These filaments with a high modulus of ≈180 GPa can be twisted into chiral coiled artificial muscles, exhibiting a unique electric thermal actuation mechanism. This tough and robust alumina artificial muscle can carry objects equivalent to 0.28 million times its weight and provide high actuation stress of up to 483.5 MPa. In addition, it exhibits 18 times higher contraction power and 240 times higher energy density than human muscles, as well as a high energy conversion efficiency of up to 7.59%, which far exceeds most reported actuated carbon and polymer artificial muscles. This work has achieved large‐scale manufacturing of high‐modulus oxide ceramic muscles for the first time.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To overcome the challenges of limited light penetration and insufficient oxygen supply in PDT for metastatic tumor treatment, a self‐contained organelle‐mimicking nanoreactor is engineered with DNA switches using cell‐inspired compartmentalization technology. It utilizes endogenous glucose as a biofuel, luminol as a light source, and hemoglobin as an oxygen supplier to achieve self‐illuminating chemiexcited PDT via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer.








Abstract
Metastasis, the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, presents challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its reliance on localized light and oxygen application to tumors. To overcome these limitations, a self‐sustained organelle‐mimicking nanoreactor is developed here with programmable DNA switches that enables bio‐chem‐photocatalytic cascade‐driven starvation‐photodynamic synergistic therapy against tumor metastasis. Emulating the compartmentalization and positional assembly strategies found in living cells, this nano‐organelle reactor allows quantitative co‐compartmentalization of multiple functional modules for the designed self‐illuminating chemiexcited PDT system. Within the space‐confined nanoreactor, biofuel glucose is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which enhances luminol‐based chemiluminescence (CL), consequently driving the generation of photochemical singlet oxygen (1O2) via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. Meanwhile, hemoglobin functions as a synchronized oxygen supplier for both glucose oxidation and PDT, while also exhibiting peroxidase‐like activity to produce hydroxyl radicals (·OH). Crucially, the nanoreactor keeps switching off in normal tissues, with on‐demand activation in tumors through toehold‐mediated strand displacement. These findings demonstrate that this nanoreactor, which is self‐sufficient in light and oxygen and precise in striking tumors, presents a promising paradigm for managing highly metastatic cancers.

<title>Flat‐Band Electronic Bipolarity in a Janus and Kagome van der Waals Semiconductor Nb3TeI7</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202415045?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A Janus and Kagome van der Waals material Nb3TeI7 exhibits strong electronic bipolar states and robust semiconducting properties with the face‐dependent n‐type and p‐type field‐effect transistor behaviors. Strong built‐in out‐of‐plane polarization is attributed to ferroelectric‐like stacking, amplified by strong electron correlation in the Nb flat bands at the breathing‐Kagome lattice, endowing Nb3TeI7 with a promising material platform for Janus‐material‐based applications.








Abstract
Janus materials, a novel class of materials with two faces of different chemical compositions and electronic polarities, offer significant potential for various applications with catalytic reactions, chemical sensing, and optical or electronic responses. A key aspect for such functionalities is face‐dependent electronic bipolarity, which is usually limited by the chemical distinction of terminated surfaces and has not been exploited in the semiconducting regime. Here, it is showed that a Janus and Kagome van der Waals (vdW) material Nb3TeI7 has ferroelectric‐like coherent stacking of the Janus layers and hosts strong electronic bipolar states in the semiconducting regime. A large potential difference of ∼ 0.7 eV between the I4 and TeI3 terminated surfaces is observed, despite only one fourth of the I atoms being replaced by Te atoms on one side of the layers. Additionally, robust semiconducting properties with the face‐dependent n‐type and p‐type field‐effect transistor behaviors are demonstrated. These unique properties are attributed to Nb 4d orbital flat bands of the breathing‐Kagome lattice, of which significantly large electron mass makes the semiconducting properties immune to impurity doping, and inherent strong electron correlation enhances asymmetric electron distribution, thereby amplifying a built‐in electric field. These findings highlight that naturally‐grown Janus and Kagome vdW semiconductors provide a promising material platform for utilizing strong electronic bipolarity in 2D‐material‐based applications.

<title>Spin‐Orbit‐Locking Vectorial Metasurface Holography</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a general multi‐channel vectorial holography technique encoded by both the spin and orbital angular momentum using a minimalist, non‐interleaved, geometry‐phase metasurface. The approach not only substantially enhances the selectivity of the input light, exhibiting spin‐orbit‐locking behavior, but also expands the multiplexing capacity of the output optical field, opening new avenues for advanced light manipulation.








Abstract
Vectorial metasurface holography, allowing for independent control over the amplitude, phase, and polarization distribution of holographic images enabled by metasurfaces, plays a crucial role in the realm of optical display, optical, and quantum communications. However, previous research on vectorial metasurface holography has typically been restricted to single degree of freedom input and single channel output, thereby demonstrating a very limited modulation capacity. This work presents a novel method to achieve multi‐channel vectorial metasurface holography by harnessing spin‐orbit‐locking vortex beams. In each channel, the optical vectorial field is encoded with a pair of total angular momentums (TAMs) featuring two orthogonal spin angular momentums (SAMs) independently locked with arbitrary orbital angular momentums (OAMs). The methodology relies on a modified Gerchberg‐Saxton algorithm, enabling the encoding of various TAM channels within a single phase profile. Consequently, a pure geometry‐phase metasurface with a non‐interleaved approach can be used to support such multi‐channel vectorial holography, achieving high selectivity of both SAM and OAM, and offering precise routing and manipulation of complex light channels. The work presents a paradigm shift in the field of holography, offering promising avenues for high‐density optical information processing and future photonic device design.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Partially ligand‐exchanged InP QDs with lipoic acid can undergo direct optical patterning when exposed to UV light, which induces disulfide ring opening, leading to polymerization and the assembly of the QDs. This approach also allows for the creation of stretchable QD films that can be recycled through reversible polymerization. This study provides a solution for future advanced displays and optoelectronics.








Abstract
The evolution of display technologies is rapidly transitioning from traditional screens to advanced augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) and wearable devices, where quantum dots (QDs) serve as crucial pure‐color emitters. While solution processing efficiently forms QD solids, challenges emerge in subsequent stages, such as layer deposition, etching, and solvent immersion. These issues become especially pronounced when developing diverse form factors, necessitating innovative patterning methods that are both reversible and sustainable. Herein, a novel approach utilizing lipoic acid (LA) as a ligand is presented, featuring a carboxylic acid group for QD surface attachment and a reversible disulfide ring structure. Upon i‐line UV exposure, the LA ligand initiates ring‐opening polymerization (ROP), crosslinking the QDs and enhances their solvent resistance. This method enables precise full‐color QD patterns with feature sizes as small as 3 µm and pixel densities exceeding 3788 ppi. Additionally, it supports the fabrication of stretchable QD composites using LA‐derived monomers. The reversible ROP process allows for flexibility, self‐healing, and QD recovery, promoting sustainability and expanding QD applications for ultra‐fine patterning and on‐silicon displays.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A mesoporous B‐doped carbon (meso‐BPC) with highly efficient curved B4C active sites for 2e− oxygen reduction reaction catalyst under a neutral electrolyte is reported. Combining experiments with dentity functional theory calculations, it is revealed that the mesoporous structure and B4C active site on the curved carbon surface significantly improve the oxygen supply and catalytic activity at high current densities and air‐supplied environments.









Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e− oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost‐effective and safe alternative to the energy‐intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air‐fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H2O2 production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B‐doped carbons with novel curved B4C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using a pore‐former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e− ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B4C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e− ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B4C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150 mA cm−2 under air‐supplied conditions, along with an impressive O2 utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis in a practical environment.

Herein, this work demonstrates a radical technology that will transforms the current display industry beyond the backplane limits. The pixel circuit integrated micro‐LED (PIMLED) does not need an active‐matrix backplane but has an active‐pixel circuit into it. The proposed PIMLED is compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic‐based transfer technology and free from angular misalignment during vertical integration.








Abstract
Recent advances in mass transfer technology are expected to bring next‐generation micro light‐emitting diodes (µLED) displays into reality, although reliable integration of the active‐matrix backplane with the transferred µLEDs remains as a challenge. Here, the µLED display technology is innovated by demonstrating pixel circuit‐integrated micro‐LEDs (PIMLEDs) and integrating them onto a transparent glass substrate. The PIMLED comprises of low‐temperature poly‐silicon transistors and GaN µLED. The square‐shaped PIMLED is designed to secure a larger process margin but to reduce misalignment in the subsequent bonding process. Its unique four‐fold rotational symmetric design together with concentric circular pixel electrodes of the substrate makes their massive transfer compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic‐based transfer and free from angular misalignment during wafer bonding. The vertically integrated pixels show similar optical and electrical properties regardless of four possible arrangements. It is demonstrated that a 96 × 96 PIMLED display on a transparent glass substrate, which is expected to open a door to novel form‐factor free and transparent µLED displays.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A reversible switching between colored and bleached phases of three colors of inorganic perovskite smart windows is induced using dimethyl sulfoxide vapor at room temperature. Compared with normal houses in field tests, the model houses with three colors of smart windows reached a maximum indoor temperature drop of 2.6, 3.6, and 4.2 °C at noon, respectively, showing excellent energy‐saving potential.








Abstract
Perovskite smart windows (PSWs) are widely investigated owing to excellent thermochromic properties, while restricted by poor transition performance and cycle stability. Herein, dimethyl sulfoxide vapor is utilized as an induction reagent for rapid reversible switching at room temperature between the colored and bleached phases. To obtain PSWs with different optical properties and transition performance, red CsPbIBr2, yellow Rb0.5Cs0.5PbIBr2 and brown CsSn0.1Pb0.9IBr2 are prepared through alloying. The perovskites can exhibit reversible switching at 27.4–34.3 °C within 1.9–5.1 min. Even after 100 cycles, they exhibit remarkable stability of luminous transmittance (retention ≥97.4%) and transition time (retention ≥97.6%). Experimental characterization proves that the reversible switching occurs between colored three‐dimension perovskite phase and bleached zero‐dimension perovskite phase. In the field test (air temperature = 21.6–26.5 °C), model houses with PSWs exhibit a maximum indoor temperature drop of 4.2 °C. Furthermore, they exhibit considerable temperature modulation ability up to 7.9 °C under a solar simulator (temperature of the control model house = 60 °C). The decrease in the luminous transmittance of the PSWs after 20 days is 2.9%, indicating excellent long‐term stability. This study offers PSWs with prominent transition performance and long cycle stability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Left‐ and right‐handed magnons, thermally generated in a compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, propagate efficiently through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Within NiO, these magnons undergo distinct decay processes, unveiling a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission induced by interfacial spin‐flop coupling. These findings provide new insights for advancing chirality‐based magnonics.








Abstract
The chirality of magnons, exhibiting left‐ and right‐handed polarizations analogous to the counterparts of spin‐up and spin‐down, has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing. However, the potential of this paradigm is constrained by the controllable excitation and transmission of chiral magnons. Here, the magnon transmission is explored in the Gd3Fe5O12/NiO/Pt structures. It is demonstrated that both left‐ and right‐handed magnon modes, thermally generated in the compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, can efficiently propagate through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Remarkably, these modes undergo distinct decay processes in NiO, manifested by different evolutions of the spin diffusion length with temperature. This behavior can be explained by an exchange model rooted in the spin‐flop magnetic configuration between Gd3Fe5O12 and NiO, which establishes a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission. These findings offer significant fundamental insight into controlling chiral magnons, opening avenues for chirality‐based magnonics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The “bifunctional group modulation strategy” enables precise emission wavelength control while maintaining exceptionally narrow FWHM values. Non‐sensitized pure green OLEDs based on DBNDS‐TPh exhibited peak EQE of 34.5% and 36.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.76) and (0.19, 0.75) at the doping concentration of 1 and 3 wt.%. This is the first instance of a green OLED in a bottom‐emitting device structure achieving a CIEy value of 0.76.








Abstract
Herein, a parallel “bifunctional group” modulation method is proposed to achieve controlled modulation of the emission wavelength and full‐width at half‐maximum (FWHM) values. As a result, three proof‐of‐concept emitters, namely DBNDS‐TPh, DBNDS‐DFPh, and DBNDS‐CNPh, are designed and synthesized, with the first functional dibenzo[b,d]thiophene unit concurrently reducing the bandgap and elevate their triplet state energy. A second functional group 1,1′:3′,1″‐triphenyl, and electron acceptors 1,3‐difluorobenzene and benzonitrile, respectively, to deepen the HOMO and LUMO levels. Accordingly, the CIE coordinates of DBNDS‐TPh, DBNDS‐DFPh, and DBNDS‐CNPh are (0.13, 0.77), (0.14, 0.77), and (0.14, 0.76) respectively, in a dilute toluene solution. This marks the first instance of achieving a CIEy value of 0.77 in dilute toluene solutions. Significantly, the non‐sensitized pure‐green OLEDs based on DBNDS‐TPh and DBNDS‐DFPh demonstrate peak EQE of 35.0% and 34.5%, with corresponding CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.75), (0.17, 0.76) at the doping concentration of 1 wt.%, representing the first green OLED with a CIEy value reaching 0.76 in a bottom‐emitting device structure as reported in the literature.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The crystallization mechanism of the biomimetic calcification method triggers a secondary conformational transition of proteins from α‐helix to β‐sheet in solvents. The adoption of the β‐sheet conformation enhances the affinity for metal ions, thereby intensifying the competitive interaction with organic ligands and expediting crystal formation and encapsulation.








Abstract
Biomimetic calcification is a micro‐crystallization process that mimics the natural biomineralization process, where biomacromolecules regulate the formation of inorganic minerals. In this study, it is presented that a protein‐assisted biomimetic calcification method for the in situ synthesis of nitrogen‐doped metal‐organic framework (MOF) materials. A series of unique core‐shell structures are created by utilizing proteins as templates and guiding agents in the nucleation step, creating ideal conditions for shell growth. To further understand the influence of the protein and organic ligand on the morphology of the MOF shell, the competing mechanism toward metal ions is supposed. Through systematic experiments and analyses, a strategy to construct unique precursor structures by controlling calcification nucleation is proposed. After carbonization, protein‐containing precursors exhibit exceptional porous characteristics, stability, and high nitrogen content. These attributes make them promising materials as sulfur hosts in lithium‐sulfur batteries (LSB). Electrochemical tests confirm that biomimetic calcification‐assisted 3D carbonaceous structure can effectively immobilize dissolved polysulfides, demonstrating strong adsorption and catalytic capabilities. This discovery not only opens up new avenues for employing biomimetic calcification as a sustainable method for batteries but also enlightens the fields of materials science, catalytic chemistry, and energy storage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
K2FeSiO4 is synthesized and utilized as a cathode material for potassium‐ion batteries. This compound offers advantages including high elemental abundance, low cost, and structural stability. Ultrahigh capacity can be achieved through charge compensation involving Fe cations and O anions during cycling. Additionally, the strong Si─O bond can effectively immobilize O anions to prevent excessive lattice oxygen loss.








Abstract
Single‐electron transfer, low alkali metal contents, and large‐molecular masses limit the capacity of cathodes. This study uses a cost‐effective and light‐molecular‐mass orthosilicate material, K2FeSiO4, with a high initial potassium content, as a cathode for potassium‐ion batteries to enable the transfer of more than one electron. Despite the limited valence change of Fe ions during cycling, K2FeSiO4 can undergo multiple electron transfers via successive oxygen anionic redox reactions to generate a high reversible capacity. Although the formation of O‒O dimers in K2FeSiO4 occur upon removing large amounts of potassium, the strong binding effect of Si on O mitigates irreversible oxygen release and voltage degradation during cycling. K2FeSiO4 achieves 236 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1, with an energy density of 520 Wh kg−1, which can be comparable with commercial LiFePO4 materials. Moreover, it also exhibits 1400 stable cycles under high‐current conditions. These findings enhance the potential commercialization prospects for potassium‐ion batteries.

Using food‐safe sargassum nanocellulose as the binder framework, combined with food‐grade additives, a highly biocompatible fully ingestible supercapacitor is successfully employed. This design introduces high mechanical strength and fast ion transport behavior of the nanofiber, achieving a disposable power supply and electrical stimulation antibacterial in vivo, which provides a promising alternative power source for novel medical electronic devices.








Abstract
Small high‐performance energy modules have significant practical value in the biomedical field, such as painless diagnosis, alleviation of gastrointestinal discomfort, and electrical stimulation therapy. However, due to performance limitations and safety concerns, it is a formidable challenge to design a small, emerging ingestible power supply. Here, a fully ingestible supercapacitor (FISC) constructed of sargassum cellulose nanofiber is presented. FISCs exhibit an electrode areal capacitance of 2.29 F cm−2 and a high energy density of 307 µWh cm−2. Furthermore, over 90% of the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli is achieved during the self‐discharge process. Therefore, following insertion into an enteric capsule, this device can enable a disposable power supply and electrostimulation for bacteriostasis in the intestine after being swallowed by a human, which offers new possibilities for scientific and simple therapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel advanced oxidation strategy leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials, facilitating the decomposition of H2O2 to generate •OH and •O2− free radicals, which promote oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. It effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine‐containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid‐state regeneration process.








Abstract
Among direct recycling methods for spent lithium‐ion batteries, solid‐state regeneration is the route with minimal bottlenecks for industrial application and is highly compatible with the current industrial cathode materials production processes. However, surface structure degradation and interfacial impurities of spent cathodes significantly hinder Li+ replenishment during restoration. Herein, we propose a unique advanced oxidation strategy that leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials to address these challenges. This strategy decomposes H2O2 to generate •OH and •O2− free radicals, facilitating oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. As a result, this approach effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine‐containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid‐state regeneration process. The regenerated LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes demonstrate a specific capacity of 206 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, comparable to commercially available cathodes. Meanwhile, this advanced oxidation strategy proves adaptable and scalable for treating industrial dismantled LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 black mass. A 3.1 Ah pouch cell assembled with the regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits impressive capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles. Additionally, a techno‐economic analysis reveals that this strategy possesses low energy consumption, minimal environmental footprint, and high economic viability, suggesting its suitability for the battery recycling industry.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work focuses on the synergistic control between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in the molecular ferroelectric material, TMCM‐MnCl3. It demonstrates that FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical writing can trigger FP reversal. This enables a seamless transition between electric‐writing optical‐reading and optical‐writing electrical‐reading modes, hinting at the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory in ferroelectric fields.









Abstract
Utilizing the correlation among diverse physical properties to facilitate multiplexing and multistate memory is anticipated to emerge as an efficient strategy to enhance memory capacity, achieve device miniaturization, and ensure information security. As an important functional material, ferroelectrics have long been considered as a potential candidate in multistate memory devices. Furthermore, the integration of optical response offers an alternative path to realizing multiplexing features, further enhancing the versatility and efficiency of these devices. However, combining ferroelectricity and optical activity is always challenging because ferroelectricity is very sensitive to the crystal structure. In this study, on the correlation between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in molecular ferroelectric material, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese (TMCM‐MnCl3) is reported. This research demonstrated that the FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical illumination can trigger FP reversal. Based on these, both electric‐writing optical‐reading (EWOR) and optical‐writing electrical‐reading (OWER) modes have been conclusively established, and the seamless transition between these two modes can be achieved by adjusting the excitation light intensity. These findings reveal an intriguing physical interconnection and imply the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory functionalities in systems based on ferroelectrics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An anti‐scattering CsPbBr3 scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging significantly suppresses light scattering and enhances the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. The scintillator array provides a high spatial‐resolution 3D reconstructed tooth image at a low X‐ray dosage in CT imaging.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) imaging has emerge as an effective medical diagnostic technique due to its rapid and 3D imaging capabilities, often employing indirect imaging methods through scintillator materials. Arraying scintillators that can confine light scattering to enable high‐resolution CT imaging remains an area of ongoing exploration for emerging perovskite scintillators. Here an anti‐scattering cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging using a cost‐effective solution‐processed method is reported. Due to the large refractive index contrast between the scintillator and matrix, photon propagation can be well confined within the CsPbBr3 scintillator array to significantly suppress the light scattering and enhance the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. Furthermore, the scintillator array exhibits low‐dosage and high‐resolution CT imaging capability by reconstructing a 3D tooth image with a good spatial resolution of 20.1 lp cm−1 at a low effective dose of 0.22 mSv. This work highlights that the CsPbBr3 scintillator array is a highly promising candidate for CT imaging.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D porous silica nanosheets (PSN)/MXene nanochannel interlayer with selective cation transport characteristics facilitates lithium ion rapid transport while rejects translocation of polysulfides, and the raised p‐band center of the surface O on PSN helps enhance polysulfide conversion kinetics. This work well addresses polysulfide shuttling and dendritic lithium growth, opening up new avenues for expanding application of nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Commercialization of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries is largely limited by polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics. Herein, 2D nanochannel interlayer composed of alternatively‐stacked porous silica nanosheets (PSN) and Ti3C2Tx‐MXene are developed. The 2D nanochannels with selective cation transport characteristics facilitate lithium ion rapid transport, while reject the translocation of polysulfide anions across the separator. The hydroxylated MXene shifts the p‐band center of the surface O on PSN closer to the Fermi level, leading to strong absorptive/catalytic effect for polysulfides and thus fast polysulfide transformation kinetics. Together with the ion/electron bi‐conduction function of PSN/MXene, the Li–S batteries deliver high initial capacity of 1443 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, low‐capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle over 800 cycles at 2 C, and excellent rate capability. At a high sulfur loading of 5.2 mg cm−2, the cells present higher areal specific capacity than commercial lithium ion batteries. The pouch cells with lean electrolyte (E/S = 3.9 µL mg−1) yield a capacity of 2‐Ah at 100 mA, high energy density and excellent cycling stability. This contribution opens up new avenues for expanding application of 2D nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

<guid>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202417409?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work systematically explores piezoelectric response of vitamin‐based self‐assemblies for power generation. Vitamin molecules can self‐assemble into different supramolecular structures exhibiting tunable predicted piezoelectric coefficients. Vitamin B7 D‐biotin (D‐BIO) self‐assemblies with high piezoelectricity are fabricated into piezoelectric devices for human motion monitoring and energy harvesting. These findings will facilitate the exploration and development of biomolecule‐based piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Structural diversity of biomolecules leads to various supramolecular organizations and asymmetric architectures of self‐assemblies with significant piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectricity of biomolecular self‐assemblies has not been fully explored and the relationship between supramolecular structures and piezoelectricity remains poorly understood, which hinders the development of piezoelectric biomaterials. Herein, for the first time, the piezoelectricity of vitamin‐based self‐assemblies for power generation is systematically explored. X‐ray diffraction studies revealed that vitamin molecules can self‐assemble into different supramolecular structures, which exhibited tunable piezoelectric coefficients ranging from 3.8 to 42.8 pC N−1 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, vitamin B7 D‐biotin (D‐BIO) self‐assemblies exhibited superior piezoelectricity due to low crystal symmetry and high polarization of supramolecular arrangements. The D‐BIO assemblies‐based piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) produced output voltages of ≈0.8 V under a mechanical force of 47 N, showing high mechanical durability after 5400 pressing‐releasing cycles and high stability of at least three months. The PENG‐based wearable sensor successfully detected bending motions of human limbs. Furthermore, the PENG‐based insole converted biomechanical energy into stable electrical energy upon foot movement, illuminating 12 light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). This work fills knowledge gaps in piezoelectricity of vitamin‐based self‐assemblies, providing paradigms for realizing high‐performance piezoelectric biomaterials through supramolecular engineering.

<title>Shear‐Mediated Stabilization of Spin Spiral Order in Multiferroic NiI2</title>
<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202417434?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magneto‐structural phases of 2D multiferroic NiI2 are studied using resonant magnetic X‐ray scattering and X‐ray diffraction. A change of magnetic symmetry from incommensurate collinear to helical spin‐spiral at a structural transition involving a significant interlayer shear is observed. These results highlight the role for interlayer magnetic exchange for driving the magnetic ground state and associated spin‐induced ferroelectricity in NiI2.








Abstract
Type‐II multiferroicity from non‐collinear spin order is recently explored in the van der Waals material NiI2. Despite the importance for improper ferroelectricity, the microscopic mechanism of the helimagnetic order remains poorly understood. Here, the magneto‐structural phases of NiI2 are investigated using resonant magnetic X‐ray scattering (RXS) and X‐ray diffraction. Two competing magnetic phases are identified. Below 60 K, an incommensurate magnetic reflection (q ≈ [0.143,0,1.49] reciprocal lattice units) is observed which exhibits finite circular dichroism in RXS, signaling the inversion symmetry‐breaking helimagnetic ground state. At elevated temperature, in the non‐polar phase (60 K < T < 75 K), a distinct q ≈ [0.087,0.087,1.5] magnetic order is observed, attributed to a collinear incommensurate (CI) state. The first‐order CI‐helix transition is concomitant with a structural transition characterized by a significant interlayer shear, which drives the helimagnetic ground state as evidenced by a mean‐field Heisenberg model including interlayer exchange and its coupling to the structural distortion. These findings identify interlayer magneto‐structural coupling as the key driver behind multiferroicity in NiI2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fluorine (F) doping is an efficient strategy to facilitate the in situ aggregation of Cu single atoms and stabilize Cu+ species. Consequently, the F‐doped Cu single‐atom catalyst exhibits outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction toward multicarbon products, achieving ultrahigh Cu utilization. This is attributed to the formation of abundant Cu nanocrystals with a high ratio of stable Cu+ species.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of multicarbon compounds from CO2 is a promising method for storing renewable electricity and addressing global CO2 issues. Single‐atom catalysts are promising candidates for CO2 reduction, but producing high‐value multicarbon (C2+) products using a single‐atom structure remains a significant challenge. In this study, a fluorine doping strategy is proposed to facilitate the reconstruction of isolated Cu atoms, promoting multicarbon generation. The in situ formed Cu nanocrystals contain a substantial amount of stable Cu+ species, demonstrating remarkable activity for CO2−to‐multicarbon conversion. Notably, they achieve the highest Cu utilization, with a C2+ partial current density of −2.01 A mgper Cu−1and a C2+ formation rate of 7.03 mmol h−1 mgper Cu−1at ≈−1 V versus RHE. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations confirm the crucial role of fluorine atoms in structural evolution and electrolysis.

A data‐driven design strategy is developed for UC therapeutic nanozymes. The optimal CT‐imageable oral UC therapeutic nanozyme SrDy2O4 is successfully discovered and the high‐dimensional structure‐activity relationships between the material database and nanozyme UC therapeutics are further elucidated by machine learning model interpretation in combination with the SISSO method.









Abstract
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with rising prevalence. Due to the recurrent and difficult‐to‐treat nature of UC symptoms, current pharmacological treatments fail to meet patients' expectations. This study presents a machine learning‐assisted high‐throughput screening strategy to expedite the discovery of efficient nanozymes for UC treatment. Therapeutic requirements, including antioxidant property, acid stability, and zeta potential, are quantified and predicted by using a machine learning model. Non‐quantifiable attributes, including intestinal barrier repair efficacy and biosafety, are assessed via high‐throughput screening. Feature significance analysis, sure independence screening, and sparsifying operator symbolic regression reveal the high‐dimensional structure‐activity relationships between material features and therapeutic needs. SrDy2O4 with high stability, low toxicity, targeting ability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability is identified, which reduces ROS production, lowers cytochrome C levels in cytoplasm, and inhibits apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Mice treated with SrDy2O4 show improvements in colon length and body weight compared with dextran sodium sulfate salt‐treated model group. Transcriptomic and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that SrDy2O4 boosts beneficial gut bacteria, and decreases pathogenic bacteria, thereby effectively restoring gut microbiota balance. Moreover, SrDy2O4 offers the advantage of X‐ray imaging without side effects.

<title>Stabilizing Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Universal Surface Residual Alkali Conversion Chemistry for Rechargeable Secondary Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a universal surface residual alkali conversion strategy based on NH4F treatment and ring‐opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. The approach transforms residual alkali into a stable polymer coating which can enhance interfacial stability, suppress lattice oxygen release and reduce side reactions, providing a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for layered oxide cathodes in practical application.








Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are attractive cathode candidates for rechargeable secondary batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, LTMOs suffer from severe capacity attenuation, voltage decay, and sluggish kinetics, resulting from irreversible lattice oxygen evolution and unstable cathode‐electrolyte interface. Besides, LTMOs accumulate surface residual alkali species, like hydroxides and carbonates, during synthesis, limiting their practical application. Herein, a universal strategy is suggested to in situ convert surface residual alkali into a stable polymer coating layer for LTMOs, thus turning wastes into treasure. The formation process of polymer coating involves NH4F treatment to consume residual alkali, then utilizing generated fluorides to induce the ring‐opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Implementing this strategy to Li‐rich Mn‐based cathode materials (LRM) results in a notable reduction in voltage hysteresis, along with enhanced kinetics and cycling stability in lithium‐ion batteries. With this layer of encapsulation, surface lattice oxygen release and layered‐to‐spinel phase transition of LRM are significantly alleviated with minimal mechanical degradation and surface parasitic reactions. Such strategy can also be applied to air‐sensitive sodium‐rich LTMOs in sodium‐ion batteries, which showcases superior universality. This work might provide a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for LTMOs in practical application.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This article introduces an innovative method, achieving molecular‐level epitaxial growth of metal–organic frameworks (MOF) on BiVO4 photoanodes by precisely controlling the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The seamless interface of BiVO4/MOF optimizes electron transfer and reduces recombination losses, elevating the overall efficiency of the PEC water oxidation.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface is crucial for high‐performance photoelectrodes, as it directly influences the availability of surface charges for solar water oxidation. However, establishing strong molecular‐level connections between these interfaces to achieve superior interfacial quality presents significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative electrochemical etching method that generates a high concentration of oxygen vacancy sites on BiVO4 surfaces (Ov‐BiVO4), enabling interactions with the oxygen‐rich ligands of MIL‐101. This reduces the formation energy and promotes conformal growth on BiVO4. The Ov‐BiVO4/MIL‐101 composite exhibits an ideal semiconductor/cocatalyst interface, achieving an impressive photocurrent density of 5.91 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, along with excellent stability. This high‐performing photoanode enables an unbiased tandem device with an Ov‐BiVO4/MIL‐101‐Si solar cell system, achieving a solar‐to‐hydrogen efficiency of 4.33%. The molecular‐level integration mitigates surface states and enhances the internal electric field, facilitating the migration of photogenerated holes into the MIL‐101 overlayer. This process activates highly efficient Fe catalytic sites, which effectively adsorb water molecules, lowering the energy barrier for water oxidation and improving interfacial kinetics. Further studies confirm the broad applicability of oxygen vacancy‐induced molecular epitaxial growth in various MOFs, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for optimizing interfaces and enhancing photocatalytic activity.

Simply adding a nucleating agent N,N′‐(1,4‐phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA) to poly(2,5‐bis(3‐alkylthiophen‐2‐yl)thieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (PBTTT‐C14) precisely tunes its crystallization and maximizes structural order. The improved molecular packing reduces disorder and elevates charge mobility. With optimized doping, this polymer achieves remarkable electrical conductivity (up to 1968 S cm⁻¹) and a power factor ≈176 µW m−1 K−2, expanding possibilities for high‐performance thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Controlling the microstructure of semiconducting polymers is critical for optimizing thermoelectric performance, yet remains challenging, requiring complex processing techniques like alignment. In this study, a straightforward strategy is introduced to enhance the thermoelectric properties of semi‐crystalline polymer films by incorporating minimal amounts of nucleating agents, a method widely used in traditional polymer industries. By blending less than 1 wt% of N,N′‐(1,4‐phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA) into poly(2,5‐bis(3‐alkylthiophen‐2‐yl)thieno[3,2‐b]thiophene) (PBTTT‐C14), controlled modulation of crystallization behavior is achieved, resulting in reduced structural disorder and enhanced charge carrier mobility. Systematic investigations reveal that an optimal PDA loading of 0.9 wt% increases the crystallization degree by 45% compared to pristine PBTTT‐C14 films. Under these optimized conditions, the PDA‐modified PBTTT‐C14 films exhibit a maximum electrical conductivity of 1,894 S cm−1 and a maximum power factor of 176 µW m−1 K−2, showing improvements of 96% and 433%, respectively, over doped pristine PBTTT‐C14 films. These gains are attributed to the synergistic effects of polymer chain extension and reduced grain boundary resistance, which collectively enhance charge transport efficiency. Additionally, ion exchange doping is found to maintain a high charge carrier concentration while preserving the crystallinity introduced by PDA, paving the way for advanced thermoelectric materials and next‐generation polymer‐based electronics.

Cellulose nanofiber and alginate from natural sargassum are used to prepare a fire‐retardant structural material through a hydrogel layer‐by‐layer method. This bio‐based material has excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and fire retardancy. This work greatly improves the utilization of seaweed residues and natural polymers, provides a bio‐based fire‐retardant strategy, and has important potential in the future development of high‐performance fiber‐based materials.









Abstract
With increasing concern about the environmental pollution of petrochemical plastics, people are constantly exploring environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative materials. Compared with petrochemical materials, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of mechanical properties, thermal properties, cost, and biodegradability. However, the flammability of cellulose hinders its practical application to a certain extent, so improving the fire‐retardant properties of cellulose nanofiber‐based materials has become a research focus. Here, cellulose nanofiber and alginate are extracted from abundant natural sargassum as high‐strength nanoscale building blocks, and then a sargassum cellulose fire‐retardant structural material is prepared through a bottom‐up hydrogel layer‐by‐layer method. The structural materials obtained incorporate excellent mechanical properties (≈297 MPa), thermal stability (≈200 °C), low thermal expansion coefficient (≈7.17 × 10−6 K−1), and fire‐retardant properties. This work largely improves the utilization of seaweed residue and natural polymers, providing a bio‐based fire‐retardant strategy, and has a wide range of development prospects in the field of fiber‐based high‐performance structural materials in the future.

A unique Bi‐RuO2 single‐atom alloy oxide is rational designed and achieved by phase engineering of the hexagonal close‐packed RuBi single‐atom alloy, to boost oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation, enabling a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm−2.









Abstract
Engineering nanomaterials at single‐atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO2‐based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi‐RuO2 single‐atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed (hcp) RuBi single‐atom alloy. This Bi‐RuO2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192 mV and superb stability over 650 h at 10 mA cm−2, enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm−2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate‐evolving mechanism on Bi‐RuO2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high‐performance electrocatalysts at atomic‐level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super‐hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee‐ring effect during the large‐area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.








Abstract
The coffee‐ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large‐area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO2 is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super‐hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro‐spherical depression structure on the SnO2 surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super‐hydrophilicity and micro‐rough structure on the surface of SnO2, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm2) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large‐scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus‐coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm2), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high‐performance and stable large‐scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

A microglial‐biomimetic memantine‐loaded polydopamine nanomedicine, PDA‐Mem@M, that achieves blood‐brain barrier penetration and brain inflammation site targeting for rapid and precise treatment of depression is designed. PDA‐Mem@M effectively alleviate depression‐like behaviors. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti‐inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.








Abstract
Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, and monoamine‐based antidepressants as first‐line therapy remain ineffective in some patients. The synergistic modulation of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity could be a major strategy for treating depression. In this study, an inflammation‐targeted microglial biomimetic system, PDA‐Mem@M, is reported for treating depression. Microglial membrane‐coated nanoparticles penetrate the blood‐brain barrier and facilitate microglial targeting. Subsequently, owing to the excellent free radical‐scavenging capacity, PDA‐Mem@M attenuate the brain inflammatory microenvironment. After on‐demand release from the nanoparticles, memantine increases the expression of brain‐derived neurotrophic factors and reverses the loss of synaptic dendritic spines. Further, in vivo studies demonstrate that PDA‐Mem@M effectively alleviate depression‐like behaviors to a greater extent than memantine or polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) monotherapy. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti‐inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Distinct interactions between phytic acid and various polymers are discovered first and leveraged to construct a gradient ionic hydrogel‐based pressure sensor, which offers excellent sensitivity, wide sensing range, and superior low‐pressure detection performance. The gradient ionic hydrogel‐based sensor recognizes subtle pressures from acoustic waves and airflow, moderate pressures due to speaking and finger pressing, and high magnitudes of plantar pressures.








Abstract
Ionic conductive hydrogels have emerged as an excellent option for constructing dielectric layers of interfacial iontronic sensors. Among these, gradient ionic hydrogels, due to the intrinsic gradient elastic modulus, can achieve a wide range of pressure responses. However, the fabrication of gradient hydrogels with optimal mechanical and sensing properties remains a challenge. In this study, it is discovered first that phytic acid (PA) interacts in remarkably distinct manners (i.e., plasticizing effects and phase separation) with different polymers (i.e., polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid). This distinctive PA‐polymer interacting mechanism is innovatively utilized to construct a modulus gradient ionic hydrogel through a simple precursor solution infiltration approach. The gradient hydrogel‐based flexible pressure sensor not only achieves a high sensitivity (9.00 kPa−1, <15 kPa) and a broad sensing range (from ≈3.7 Pa to 1.2 MPa) simultaneously, but also exhibits superior low pressure sensing performance. It successfully recognizes the subtle pressure due to acoustic waves and airflow, as well as the moderate pressure due to speaking and finger pressing and the high magnitude of plantar pressure. In addition, the gradient hydrogel demonstrates remarkable antibacterial properties and biocompatibility. This functional hydrogel with excellent sensing performance and bioactivity exhibits exceptional potential for wearable sensing applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel planar three‐electrode structure is constructed on the Ti3+ self‐doping 0.5Ba(Zr0.2TI0.8)O3‐0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT‐BCT) ceramic surface that has an obvious photovoltaic and pyroelectric response. Through a specific polarization method, the device shows a region‐dependent photoelectric response. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are achieved on a single ferroelectric ceramic chip.








Abstract
Differentiating photoelectric response in a single material with a simple approach is desirable for all‐in‐one optoelectronic logical devices. In ferroelectric materials, significantly distinct photoelectric features should be observed if they are in diverse polarization states, unveiling a possible pathway to realize multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates through ferroelectric polarization design. In this study, the Ti3+ self‐doping strategy is first applied to 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3‐0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 ferroelectric ceramics (BZT‐BCT‐xT) through co‐firing metallic Ti powders and BZT‐BCT powders to enhance photoelectric output. Subsequently, on the BZT‐BCT‐3T ceramic surface that has optimal photoelectric properties, three individual regions are separated and heterogeneously polarized by using a novel planar three‐electrodes structure. Intriguing illumination region‐dependent photocurrent directions are demonstrated in this as‐fabricated device. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are integrated into single ferroelectric ceramic via fully light‐controlled methods, including “AND”, “OR”, “NOT”, “NAND” and “NOR”. These gates can be readily switched by simply altering the output electrodes or light intensity of 405 nm LED modulating light. This work not only puts forward an innovative strategy for designing ferroelectric optoelectronic logic gates, but also provides feasibility for more ferroelectric materials to be applied in logical devices.

<title>Supramolecular Organic Nanofiller: A New Reinforcement Strategy for Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks Toward Upcycling of Carbon Fiber Composites</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers via asynchronous polymerization is proposed. The reinforcement and recyclability of the supramolecular organic nanofillers on DCPN considerably exceed those of traditional methods. This reinforcement strategy is versatile and can be successfully applied for the upcycling of high‐performance CF composites.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPN) provide an important solution to the challenging recyclability of thermoset elastomers. However, dynamic bonds exhibit relatively weak bond energies, considerably decreasing the mechanical properties of DCPN. Herein, a novel reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers through asynchronous polymerization is proposed. Owing to the difference in the reactivity of the isocyanate groups and the gradual deblocking of aldimine, asynchronous cross‐linking of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isocyanate‐terminated prepolymer containing dynamic oxime–urethane bonds with the deblocked tris(2‐aminoethyl)amine facilitates the transition from the molecular interpenetration of chains into immiscible polymerization. This results in thermodynamic incompatibility between the hyperbranched clusters and long chains, inducing a spontaneous formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers. Compared to traditional reinforcement strategies, supramolecular organic nanofillers considerably improve the mechanical properties of DCPN. Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions between hyperbranched clusters and dynamic oxime–urethane bonds enable the network with excellent recyclability. The unique reinforcement and recyclability of the prepared DCPN allow their combination with carbon fibers (CF) to form CF composites with outstanding properties for personal‐protection applications, achieving CF composite upcycling. This study offers a novel strategy on the reinforcement of DCPN and the upcycling of high‐performance CF composites.

Based on two kinds of biomolecule‐MOFs, we construct a self‐powered multi‐functional wearable device by combining Zn‐Car_MOF and patterned PDMS to achieve various environmental energy collection (water droplets, ocean energy, and e‐bike driving) and human gait detection, when Thy loaded Cu‐HHTP_MOF combined with wearable fibers are cooperated with Zn‐Car_TPHG, achieving electrocatalytic ROS generation and drug releasing synergistic sterilization.








Abstract
New types of metal–organic framework (MOF) materials have great potential in solving the current global dilemma on energy, environment, and medical care. Herein, based on two kinds of biomolecule‐MOFs (Bio‐MOFs) with favorable biocompatibility and degradation‐reconstruction characteristics, we have established a self‐powered muti‐functional device to achieve an efficient and broad‐spectrum environmental energy collection and biomedical applications. Combining Zn(II) and carnosine‐based Zn‐Car_MOF possessing a high piezoelectric response (d33 = 11.17 pm V−1) with patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, a tribo‐piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator (TPHG) is constructed with a synergy output of triboelectric and piezoelectric effects. The Zn‐Car_TPHG demonstrates a high output performance (131 V at 100 kPa) and a wide range of pressure response (1 Pa–100 kPa), possessing applications in environmental energy collection and biomedical sensors. To expand the application of the wearable device, a conductive hexagonal prism MOF (Cu3(2,3,6,7,10,11‐hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Cu‐HHTP)) is synthesized and employed to load thymol (Thy). Cooperating with Zn‐Car_TPHG, the resulting Cu‐HHTP/Thy can achieve an efficient self‐powered ROS (singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (·OH)) generation and drug synergistic broad‐spectrum sterilization effect (efficiency ≥ 98%). In a word, the flexible wearable device based on the muti‐functional Bio‐MOFs is sustainable and environmentally friendly, possessing wide application potential in fields of environmental energy collection, biosensors, and self‐powered antibacterial.

The high‐entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 cathode material prepared by ultrafast high temperature shock inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves the reversible and stable multielectron transfer, fabulous cycling stability and excellent wide‐temperature range operation from −50 to 60 °C. The ultrafast sintering strategy provides a broad platform for the development of polyanionic materials for long‐lifespan and all‐climate sodium‐ion batteries.








Abstract
Avoiding severe structural distortion, irreversible phase transition, and realizing the stabilized multielectron redox are vital for promoting the development of high‐performance NASICON‐type cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high‐entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 (HE‐Na3.45TMP) cathode material is prepared by ultrafast high‐temperature shock, which inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves reversible and stable multielectron transfer of 2.4/2.8 e− at voltage range of 2.0–4.45/1.5–4.45 V versus Na+/Na (the capacity of 137.2/162.0 mAh g−1). The galvanostatic charge/discharge and in‐situ X‐ray diffraction tests indicate the sequential redox reactions and approximate solid solution phase transition behavior of HE‐Na3.45TMP. Density functional theory calculations analyze the migration pathways and energy barriers, further confirming the superior reaction kinetics of HE‐Na3.45TMP. Accordingly, the HE‐Na3.45TMP exhibits outstanding wide temperature applicability and can operate stably in the temperature range of −50–60 °C, accompanied by a capacity retention of 92.8% after 400 cycles at −40 °C and a capacity of 73.7 mAh g−1 even at −50 °C. The assembled hard carbon//HE‐Na3.45TMP full‐cell offers an energy density of ≈301 Wh kg−1 based on total cathode and anode active mass, verifying the application feasibility of HE‐Na3.45TMP. This work provides an innovative and ultrafast pathway to rationally fabricate high‐performance cathodes for SIBs.

This work reports a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOFs which are exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
As an alternative to bulk counterparts, metal–organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles isolated within conductive mesoporous carbon matrices are of increasing interest for electrochemical applications. Although promising, a “clean” carbon surface is generally associated with poor compatibility and weak interactions with metal/ligand precursors, which leads to the growth of MOFs with inhomogeneous particle sizes on outer pore walls. Here, a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOF composites within mesochannels with high dispersity and stability are reported. Mesoporous polydopamine (mesoPDA)‐F127 nanospheres with unique surface chemistry, e.g., nanoconfined spaces, catechol functional groups, pyrrolic N doping, and hydrophilic PEO blocks, are found to be a suitable molecular platform. Sliced cross‐sectional TEM, HAADF‐STEM, and corresponding EDS elemental mapping, as well as nitrogen adsorption characterizations, are utilized to visualize the in situ growth process of ZIF‐8 nanoparticles. These careful analyses provides direct evidence that the highly dispersed ZIF‐8 is exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. After moderate carbonization of the mesoPDA‐F127/ZIF‐8 nanocomposites, a prototype for a mesoporous carbon‐isolated ZIF‐8 nanostructure is achieved, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons.

A new charge loss and a voltage loss model are proposed and a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m−2 is achieved by the effective collection of interface tribo‐charges and the increase in load voltage during the charge extraction process.








Abstract
The effective collection of interfacial tribo‐charges and an increase in load voltage are two essential factors that improve the output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators. However, some tribo‐charges are hardly collected through one or multiple integrated side electrodes based on corona discharge, and their load voltages are limited by air breakdown in adjacent electrodes. In this study, a dynamic quasi‐dipole potential distribution model is proposed to systematically reveal the mechanisms of interfacial tribo‐charge loss. Based on this model, an optimization route is designed to reduce the interfacial charge loss stepwise, achieving a 15‐fold improvement in charge collection from the tribo‐interface. A potential difference enhancement strategy is used for the first time to increase the air breakdown threshold between the inner electrodes and increase the output voltage under a large load. By effective increase in charge collection efficiency and load voltage, a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m−2 is obtained. This study refined and optimized the interfacial charge loss mechanisms and provided advanced guidance for efficiently extracting energy during the triboelectrification process.

An efficiently reactant‐enriched and mass traffic system is developed through integrating high‐curvature Pt nanocones with a 3D porous TiAl framework. The 3D multiple interconnected channels in TiAl boosts the mass transport rate, while the high curvature of Pt nanocones induces an ultrahigh local electric field, thereby accelerating the transfer of H3O+ during HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as one of the most advanced methods for the green production of hydrogen, is greatly impeded by inefficient mass transfer. Here we present an efficiently reactant enriched and mass traffic system by integrating high‐curvature Pt nanocones with 3D porous TiAl framework to enhance mass transfer rate. Theoretical simulations, in situ Raman spectroscopy and potential‐dependent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results disclose that the strong local electric field induced by high‐curvature Pt can greatly promote the H3O+ supply rate during HER, resulting in ∼1.6 times higher H3O+ concentration around the Pt nanocone than that in electrolyte. X‐ray computed tomography and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate the diffusion coefficient of H3O+ in 3D TiAl framework surpasses that in commercial carbon support by more than 16.7 times. Consequently, Pt/TiAl‐nanocone exhibits a high mass activity of 17.2 mA cm−2Pt at an overpotential of 100 mV with an ultrahigh TOF value of 42.9 atom−1 s−1. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the Pt/TiAl‐nanocone cathode achieves an industrial‐scale current density of 1.0 A cm−2 with a cell voltage of 1.88 V at 60 °C and can operate stably for at least 800 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 137 µV h−1.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The generated local polarization piezoelectric field (LPPEF) can be significantly enhanced through ball milling piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) by adsorbing trace amounts of water under ambient humidity conditions. Under this circumstance, the energy barrier for water dissociation can be largely lowered, thus facilitating the breaking of H–O–H bonds and the generation of hydroxyl radicals.








Abstract
Combining piezocatalysts with mechanical ball milling for dissociating water to generate hydroxyl radicals (·OH) offers unprecedented opportunities for energy conversion and environmental remediation. However, the in‐depth insights into the relationship between water and local polarization piezoelectric electric field (LPPEF) are currently lacking, in particularly, the ·OH formation mechanism in ball milling driven piezocatalyst system is not systematically elucidated. To this end, the present work constructs a ball milling driven piezoelectric solid/liquid interface between piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) and different contents of water to investigate LPPEF initiated catalytic reaction. Results show that PBOC exhibits an excellent Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) degradation efficiency with a 68.94 and 12.43 times faster rate constant than traditional SiO2 and BaTiO3, respectively. Under ambient humidity condition, the lower energy barrier of water dissociation (0.23 eV) endows ·OH generation more energetically favorable than under the water‐oversaturated condition (0.66 eV), and trace water magnifies the polarizability of [BO3] and [BO4] units in PBOC to initiate an enhanced LPPEF, thus it enhances the trapping of lone pairs electrons in trace adsorbed water by holes to contribute a higher yield of ·OH. This study constructs a highly correlated field‐initiated electron transfer system that provides opportunities for promoting the performance of piezocatalytic materials.

Surface‐plasmon‐resonance (SPR) typically detects in the nanomolar range. A pH‐conditioning of a physisorbed biolayer, hosting trillions of capturing antibodies or probes enables SPR to detect a single protein or DNA‐strand in 0.1 mL of plasma. The pH‐conditioning transition the biolayer in a metastable state where a single affinity‐biding event can trigger an amplification mechanism involving a broad self‐propagating electrostatic rearrangement








Abstract
DNA can be readily amplified through replication, enabling the detection of a single‐target copy. A comparable performance for proteins in immunoassays has yet to be fully assessed. Surface‐plasmon‐resonance (SPR) serves as a probe capable of performing assays at concentrations typically around 10⁻⁹ molar. In this study, plasmonic single‐molecule assays for both proteins and DNA are demonstrated, achieving limits‐of‐detections (LODs) as low as 10⁻2⁰ molar (1 ± 1 molecule in 0.1 mL), even in human serum, in 1 h. This represents an improvement in typical SPR LODs by eleven orders‐of‐magnitude. The single‐molecule SPR assay is achieved with a millimeter‐wide surface functionalized with a physisorbed biolayer comprising trillions of recognition‐elements (antibodies or protein–probe complexes) which undergo an acidic or alkaline pH‐conditioning. Potentiometric and surface‐probing imaging experiments reveal the phenomenon underlying this extraordinary performance enhancement. The data suggest an unexplored amplification process within the biomaterial, where pH‐conditioning, driving the biolayer in a metastable state, induces a self‐propagating aggregation of partially misfolded proteins, following single‐affinity binding. This process triggers an electrostatic rearrangement, resulting in the displacement of a charge equivalent to 1.5e per 102 recognition elements. Such findings open new opportunities for reliable SPR‐based biosensing at the physical detection limits, with promising applications in point‐of‐care plasmonic systems.

Abstract
The application of physical fields is crucial for droplet generation and manipulation, underpinning technologies like printing, microfluidic biochips, drug delivery, and flexible sensors. Despite advancements, precise micro/nanoscale droplet generation and accurate microfluidic reactions remain challenging. Inspired by the liquid ejection mechanisms in microscopic organisms, an electrostatic manipulator for the precise capture, emission, and transport of microdroplets is proposed. This approach enables the controlled and periodic emission of nanoscale daughter droplets from microscale parent droplets, achieved through dielectric pinning on surfaces and electrostatic field‐driven forces. Results show precise nanoscale droplet release on inert polymer surfaces, enabling directional, contamination‐free liquid manipulation. Moreover, leveraging surface treatment techniques and robust electrostatic force‐driven transportation, a versatile strategy for droplet generation and manipulation, spanning from microfluidic devices to chemical reaction operations. The novel droplet manipulation phenomena and control strategies can advance the fields of electrostatic‐based microfluidics, materials fabrication, and beyond.

Ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus, perovskite film demonstrates more oriented packing during the blade‐coating process. The regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94 cm2.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next‐generation photovoltaic technologies. However, perovskite films deposited by blade‐coating usually exhibit inferior film morphology compared to those fabricated by spin‐coating, which hinders the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the scalable perovskite solar modules (PSMs). Herein, ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Compared to unregulated spherical colloids, the ellipsoidal colloids demonstrate more oriented packing during the blade‐coating process, which is due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus. As a result of the improved film morphology, the regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve superior PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94 cm2, and 89% initial PCE after 600 h continuous operation.

Tailored transformation of high‐spin Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) into low‐spin Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) by introducing oxygen vacancies (Ov) can enhance reduction/adsorption of NO3‒→*NO and subsequent protonation to generate *NH2 intermediate, which in situ acts as a localized proton donor to promote *CO2→*COOH on adjacent Ce3+–O site for generating *CO intermediate, following by cross‐coupling of the reduced C‐/N‐intermediates to achieve efficient urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The co‐electrolysis of CO2 and NO3− to synthesize urea has become an effective pathway to alternate the conventional Bosch‐Meiser process, while the complexity of C‐/N‐containing intermediates for C−N coupling results in the urea electrosynthesis of unsatisfactory efficiency. In this work, an electronic spin state modulation maneuver with oxygen vacancies (Ov) is unveiled to effectively meliorate the oriented generation of key intermediates *NH2 and *CO for C−N coupling, furnishing urea in ultrahigh yield of 2175.47 µg mg−1 h−1 and Faraday efficiency of 70.1%. Mechanistic studies expound that Ov can induce the conversion of the high‐spin state Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) of Ni@CeO2−x to the low‐spin state Ni3+ (t2g6eg1), which markedly enhances the hybridization degree of the Ni 3d and the N 2p orbitals of *NO, facilitating the selective formation of *NH2. Notably, the in situ generated *NH2 intermediates can serve as a localized proton donor to promote the electroreduction of CO2 on the adjacent site Ce3+−O to exclusively afford *CO, followed by C−N coupling of each other to efficiently synthesize urea. The strategy of tailored switching of the active site spin state provides a reliable reference to rectify the electronic structure of electrocatalysts for directional CO2 valorization.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dual delivery system employing extracellular vesicles to mediate the co‐delivery of mRNA and nanozymes exhibits synergistic effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial injury, and their functional crosstalk. This system is capable of regulating microglia function from many aspects, including inhibiting NF‐κB signaling pathway, inhibiting microglia overactivation, and promoting microglia M2 polarization, and ultimately ameliorates depressive behaviors.









Abstract
The development of new non‐neurotransmitter drugs is an important supplement to the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder. The latest development of mRNA therapy provides the possibility for the treatment of some major diseases. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria constitute a highly interconnected set of fundamental organelles within cells. The interconnection between them forms specific microdomains that play pivotal roles in calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, inflammation, and autophagy. Perturbations in ER‐mitochondrial connections may contribute to the progression of neurological disorders and other diseases. Herein, an extracellular vesicles‐based delivery system, grounded in mRNA gene therapy and integrated with nanomedicine technology is devised. This system is engineered to traverse the blood–brain barrier and specifically target the central nervous system (CNS), facilitating the simultaneous delivery of mRNA drugs and metallic nanozymes into the brain. This dual‐pronged approach, targeting ER and mitochondrial crosstalk, inhibits microglial overactivation, promotes M2 polarization of microglia, and suppresses the NF‐κB signaling pathway. Consequently, it significantly alleviates Lipopolysaccharides‐induced neuroinflammatory responses and ameliorates anxiety‐ and depression‐like behaviors. This study demonstrates a novel antidepressant therapeutic strategy and establishes a new paradigm for mRNA gene therapy in CNS diseases.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical processes. This study introduces a novel acid‐induced in situ surface reconstruction strategy on metal foams, enabling efficient biomass transformation. The approach is versatile, adaptable across metals and acids, and provides a scalable platform for green chemistry, demonstrating significant potential for advancing resource recycling and sustainable industrial applications.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic biomass conversion offers a sustainable route for producing organic chemicals, with electrode design being critical to determining reaction rate and selectivity. Herein, a prediction‐synthesis‐validation approach is developed to obtain electrodes for precise biomass conversion, where the coexistence of multiple metal valence states leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the activated redox cycle. This promising integrated foam electrode is developed via acid‐induced surface reconstruction to in situ generate highly active metal (oxy)hydroxide or oxide (MOxHy or MOx) species on inert foam electrodes, facilitating the electrooxidation of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (5‐HMF) to 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Taking nickel foam electrode as an example, the resulting NiOxHy/Ni catalyst, featuring the coexistence of multivalent states of Ni, exhibits remarkable activity and stability with a FDCA yields over 95% and a Faradaic efficiency of 99%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical analysis reveal an Ni(OH)2/NiOOH‐mediated indirect pathway, with the chemical oxidation of 5‐HMF as the rate‐limiting step. Furthermore, this in situ surface reconstruction approach can be extended to various metal foams (Fe, Cu, FeNi, and NiMo), offering a mild, scalable, and cost‐effective method for preparing potent foam catalysts. This approach promotes a circular economy by enabling more efficient biomass conversion processes, providing a versatile and impactful tool in the field of sustainable catalysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An innovative, lobster tail‐inspired triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG‐SPA) is introduced, featuring self‐powered sensing capabilities. Leveraging these features, a smart TENG‐SPA‐enabled hand rehabilitation robot is developed, showing great promise in replacing the traditional assessment method—which relies on clinicians for manual stretching, subjective resistance evaluation, and experience‐based scoring—thereby driving the transformation from traditional rehabilitation medicine to modern digital rehabilitation medicine.









Abstract
Quantitative assessment for post‐stroke spasticity remains a significant challenge due to the encountered variable resistance during passive stretching, which can lead to the widely used modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for spasticity assessment depending heavily on rehabilitation physicians. To address these challenges, a high‐force‐output triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG‐SPA) inspired by a lobster tail is developed. The bioinspired TENG‐SPA can generate approximately 20 N at 0.1 MPa, providing sufficient stretching force for spastic fingers. The anti‐interference, durability, and electrical output characteristics of the TENG‐SPA under varying conditions—such as different air pressures, bending frequencies, and simulated spastic finger stretching—are explored, demonstrating TENG‐SPA's ability to sense resistance during the stretching process. Furthermore, a TENG‐SPA‐enabled hand rehabilitation robot system integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed, which is tested in a clinical trial involving 15 stroke patients. The results have demonstrated that a classification accuracy for the levels of finger spasticity reaches 93.3% and the MAS scores predicted by the CNN regression model exhibit a strong linear relationship with the actual MAS (R2 = 0.8451, p < 0.01). This study presents promising potential applications in digital rehabilitation medicine, human–machine interaction, biomedicine, and related fields.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents the development of 3D‐printed anisotropic InterPore microfibrous lattices for engineering aligned and densely populated cardiac muscle bundles. By promoting cardiomyocyte alignment and facilitating cell‐mediated remodeling in these lattices, the approach improves high‐density tissue organization, enhances electrophysiological function, and supports the maturation of cardiac tissues.








Abstract
Replicating the structural and functional features of native myocardium, particularly its high‐density cellular alignment and efficient electrical connectivity, is essential for engineering functional cardiac tissues. Here, novel electrohydrodynamically printed InterPore microfibrous lattices with anisotropic architectures are introduced to promote high‐density cellular alignment and enhanced tissue interconnectivity. The interconnected pores in the microfibrous lattice enable dynamic, cell‐mediated remodeling of fibrous hydrogels, resulting in continuous, mechanically stable tissue bundles. Compared to lattices with isolated pores, the engineered aligned cardiac tissues from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exhibit improved electrophysiological properties and synchronous contractions. Using a multiseeding strategy, an equivalent cell seeding density of 8 × 107 cells mL−1, facilitating the formation of multicellular, vascularized cardiac structures with maintained tissue viability and integrity, is achieved. As a demonstration, human‐induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived cardiac tissues are engineered with progressive maturation and functional integration over time. These findings underscore the potential of InterPore microfibrous lattices for applications in cardiac tissue engineering, drug discovery, and therapeutic development.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Methanol (MeOH) is introduced as a fluid balance agent to regulate Marangoni convection, thereby mitigating disordered colloidal particle motion. As a result, record power conversion efficiencies of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small‐area FAPbI3 devices (0.07 cm2) and large‐area modules (21 cm2), respectively.








Abstract
Laboratory‐scale spin‐coating techniques are widely employed for fabricating small‐size, high‐efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, achieving large‐area, high‐uniformity perovskite films and thus high‐efficiency solar cell devices remain challenging due to the complex fluid dynamics and drying behaviors of perovskite precursor solutions during large‐area fabrication processes. In this work, a high‐quality, pinhole‐free, large‐area FAPbI3 perovskite film is successfully obtained via scalable blade‐coating technology, assisted by a novel bidirectional Marangoni convection strategy. By incorporating methanol (MeOH) as a fluid balance agent, the direction of Marangoni convection is effectively regulated, mitigating the disordered motion of colloidal precursor particles during the printing process. As a result, champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small‐area FAPbI3 devices (0.07 cm2) and large‐area modules (21 cm2), respectively. Notably, under steady illumination, the device reached a stabilized PCE of 24.28%. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device exhibited remarkable operational stability, retaining 92.03% of its initial PCE after 1800 h under ambient conditions (35 ± 5% relative humidity, 30 °C). To demonstrate the universality of this strategy, a blue perovskite light‐emitting diode is fabricated, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 14.78% and an electroluminescence wavelength (EL) of 494 nm. This work provides a significant technique for advancing solution‐processed, industrial‐scale production of high‐quality and stable perovskite films and solar cells.

<title>Sole‐Solvent High‐Entropy Electrolyte Realizes Wide‐Temperature and High‐Voltage Practical Anode‐Free Sodium Pouch Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A sole‐solvent high‐entropy electrolyte is capable of forming stable anion‐derived electrode–electrolyte interphases, extending the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, high‐voltage anode‐free sodium batteries with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (−20–60 °C) are realized. Furthermore, Ah‐level pouch cell delivers a leadingly high energy density (209 Wh kg−1) and a high capacity retention (83.1%) after 100 cycles at 25 °C.








Abstract
Anode‐free sodium batteries (AFSBs) hold great promise for high‐density energy storage. However, high‐voltage AFSBs, especially those can stably cycle at a wide temperature range are challenging due to the poor electrolyte compatibility toward both the cathode and anode. Herein, high‐voltage AFSBs with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (−20–60 °C) are realized for the first time via a sole‐solvent high‐entropy electrolyte based on the diethylene glycol dibutyl ether solvent (D2) and NaPF6 salt. The sole‐solvent high‐entropy electrolyte with unique solvent‐ions effect of strong anion interaction and weak cation solvation enables entropy‐driven electrolyte salt disassociation and high‐concentration contact ion pairs, thus simultaneously forming stable anion‐derived electrode–electrolyte interphases on cathode and anode. Moreover, the wide liquid range of D2 further extends the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, ampere‐hour (Ah)‐level anode‐free sodium pouch cells with cyclability in a wide temperature range of −20–60 °C are realized. Impressively, the pouch cell achieves a leadingly high cell‐level energy density of 209 Wh kg−1 and a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 100 cycles at 25 °C. This work provides inspirations for designing advanced electrolytes for practical AFSBs.

<title>U‐Shaped Dimeric Acceptors for Balancing Efficiency and Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
U‐shaped dimeric acceptors, 5‐IDT and 6‐IDT, are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component. The efficiencies of 6‐IDT– and 5‐IDT‐treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively. Moreover, the smaller molecular length of 5‐IDT can well stabilize the phase‐separated morphology of the active layer, thereby significantly improving the thermal stability.








Abstract
Despite significant improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), achieving excellent stability remains a great challenge to their commercial feasibility. Here, U‐shaped dimeric acceptors (5‐IDT and 6‐IDT) with different molecular lengths are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component, respectively. The introduction of the third component effectively reduces the energetic disorder and non‐radiative voltage losses and improves the exciton dissociation and charge transport of the devices. Consequently, the PCEs of the 6‐IDT‐ and 5‐IDT‐treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively, which is the highest PCE for oligomeric acceptors‐based ternary OSCs to date. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the treated devices is dramatically improved, with the initial efficiency retention of the 6‐IDT‐ and 5‐IDT‐treated devices increasing from 18% to 32% and 75%, respectively, after 1000 h of thermal stress. This is mainly attributed to the ability of the smaller molecular length of 5‐IDT to stabilize the phase‐separated morphology of the polymeric donor and small molecular acceptor, rather than the high glass transition temperature and low diffusion coefficient.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dewatering difficulty of nanocellulose dispersion has long been a major challenge hindering its practical utilization. Here, through a supramolecular scale hydrophilicity regulation, the water retention value is substantially decreased and efficient dewatering of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) dispersion is realized, enabling the fabrication of highly dense, strong, fire‐retardant, and moldable CNF bulk materials as sustainable plastic substitutes.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are ideal building blocks for creating lightweight and strong bulk structural materials due to their unique supramolecular structure and exceptional mechanical properties within the crystalline regions. However, assembling CNFs into dense bulk structural materials with customizable shape and functionalities remains a great challenge, hindering their practical applications. Here, the dewatering issue of aqueous CNF dispersions is addressed by regulating supramolecular scale hydrophilicity using lactic acid, combined with hot‐press molding. This approach enables the fabrication of transparent CNF bulk structural materials with a density of up to 1.426 g cm−3. The mechanical properties, including isotropic in‐plane tensile strength (75.5 ± 4.5 MPa), flexural strength (198 ± 20 MPa), and hardness (≈300 MPa), surpass most engineering plastics. Moreover, unlike conventional CNF based materials, the CNF bulk structural materials exhibit remarkable water stability and flame retardancy. These unique advantages open a new avenue to bottom‐up assembly of CNFs into high‐performance multifunctional eco‐friendly structural materials, dedicating to substitution of plastics and easing the consumption of petrochemical resources.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multi‐elemental synergy strategy for regulating the local electronic structure is applied to create a broad adsorption energy landscape in high‐entropy alloy catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates in the multi‐step NO3−‐to‐NH3 conversion, effectively overcoming energy‐scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate (NO3−) to value‐added ammonia (NH3) is a complex process involving an eight‐electron transfer and numerous intermediates, presenting a significant challenge for optimization. A multi‐elemental synergy strategy to regulate the local electronic structure at the atomic level is proposed, creating a broad adsorption energy landscape in high‐entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates, effectively overcoming energy‐scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis. The HEA catalyst achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.5 ± 4.3% and a yield rate of 10.2 ± 0.5 mg h−1 mgcat−1. It also demonstrated remarkable stability over 250 h in an integrated three‐chamber device, coupling electrocatalysis with an ammonia recovery unit for continuous NH3 collection. This work elucidates the catalytic mechanisms of multi‐functional HEA systems and offers new perspectives for optimizing multi‐step reactions by circumventing adsorption‐energy scaling limitations.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel method for fabricating poly(ester amide)s combines the benefits of biodegradable polyesters and strong polyamides. These materials, made from upcycled monomers, form films, and yarns with a tensile strength of 109 MPa, tenacity of 5.0 g de−1, and withstand ironing temperatures. They achieve 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months and have a low environmental impact.








Abstract
Biodegradable polyesters provide an attractive alternative to non‐degradable plastics but often encounter a tradeoff between biodegradability and mechanical properties because esters are rotational and lack hydrogen bonds. Conversely, natural polyamides, i.e., silk exhibit excellent mechanical strength because amides are non‐rotational and form hydrogen bonds. Unlike esters, the nitrogen in amides can enhance microbial biodegradation. However, protein engineering exhibits limited productivity, and artificial polyamides, i.e., nylon remain non‐degradable due to their hydrophobic nature. Herein, a method is proposed for developing poly(ester amide)s (PEA)s, a polyester and polyamide hybrid, to address prevailing production challenges. These materials are synthesized from upcycled monomers in a 10 L reactor and converted into films and yarns. They achieve a tensile strength of 109 MPa and tenacity of 5.0 g de−1, while withstanding ironing temperatures. They achieve a remarkable 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months, which is rarely attained by current bioplastics, and exhibit low environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. While biodegradable polyesters have remained within the performance range of commodity plastics, PEAs fall into the high‐performance category, potentially reaching markets that existing biodegradable plastics have not, such as fishing lines and clothing.

<title>Surface Modification of 3D Biomimetic Shark Denticle Structures for Drag Reduction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Biomimetic shark denticles with alternating superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions are fabricated through 3D printing. Superhydrophobic and partially superhydrophobic denticles exhibit superior drag reduction performance compared to superhydrophilic ones by minimizing vortex formation, presenting a novel approach to the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimal drag reduction.








Abstract
Shark skin features superhydrophilic and riblet‐textured denticles that provide drag reduction, antifouling, and mechanical protection. The artificial riblet structures exhibit drag reduction capabilities in turbulent flow. However, the effects of the surface wettability of shark denticles and the cavity region underneath the denticle crown on drag reduction remain insufficiently explored. Here, 3D printing is utilized to fabricate realistic staggered and overlapped denticle arrays, modified to achieve superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic, and hybrid configurations, including external riblets hydrophilic/internal cavities hydrophobic (ELIB), and vice versa (EBIL). Denticles of varying heights are also fabricated. The results indicate that superhydrophobic, ELIB, and EBIL denticles outperform superhydrophilic ones in reducing drag, achieving a peak drag reduction rate of ≈20%. Notably, shorter denticles further improve drag reduction. Reduced vortex formation within the underneath cavity correlates with improved drag reduction. These vortices can function similarly to rolling bearings while facilitating momentum exchange and increasing skin friction drag. Superhydrophobic or partially superhydrophobic denticles (ELIBD/EBILD) mitigate this effect. This study suggests that sharks may secrete mucus on specific sections of their denticles to further reduce vorticity and drag, offering novel insights into the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimized drag reduction.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By adjusting the size of tungsten oxide cluster through carbon defects, sub‐nanoclusters are applied to electrocatalytic C─N coupling for amino acid synthesis. Unlike nanoclusters, sub‐nanoclusters facilitate potential tuning to optimize hydroxylamine yield, enabling the production of diverse amino acids with α‐keto acids. This study offers an innovative perspective for catalyst design in high‐value electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate‐rich wastewater and biomass‐derived blocks into high‐value products using renewably generated electricity is a promising approach to modulate the artificial carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, a new synthetic strategy of WOx sub‐nanoclusters is reported and supported on carbon materials as novel efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and its coupling with α‐keto acids. In acidic solutions, the NH3‐NH2OH selectivity can also optimized by adjusting the potential, with the total FE exceeding 80% over a wide potential range. After introducing α‐keto acids, the WOx/D‐CB electrode achieves remarkable activity and selectivity toward C2‐C6 amino acids. For glycine and alanine, impressive FEs of 49.34% and 38.22% based on transitional metal oxides can be obtained, surpassing those of WOx nanoclusters with larger size. In situ analysis and mechanistic studies reveal the critical role of WOx sub‐nanoclusters in reducing the energy barriers of key steps in alanine synthesis. This work opens up new insights into the rational design of cluster catalysts to promote electrochemical amino acid synthesis.

<title>Hydration Induces Dehydration: Creating Negative Swelling Gel by a Paradox</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Negative swelling of hydrogel is achieved via a paradoxical hydration‐induced‐dehydration pathway. Chemically crosslinked polymer network generates considerable hydrostatic pressure upon swelling, which forces transformable polymers to self‐assemble and collapse. The as‐fabricated gels can lose 35% weight underwater and exhibit water‐strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn‐off effect, which significantly broadened potential applications.









Abstract
Swelling positively in water is a common behavior of hydrogels, which, however, can lead to reduced mechanical performance and stability. Enabling negative swelling represents a promising way to address those issues but is extremely challenging to realize. Here, real negative swelling hydrogels are successfully prepared for the first time through a unique molecular architecture. Specifically designed interpenetrating transformable‐rigid polymer network undergoes self‐assembly and collapses upon hydration, which in turn dehydrates itself. This paradoxical hydration‐induced‐dehydration process brings about revolutionary outcomes. Gels can now lose up to 35% weight underwater and exhibit water‐strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn‐off effect. Those unique properties allow future material development and applications to be carried out in much broader dimensions.

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have gained significant attention for ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. As the applications of TENG devices expand, their safety and reliability becomes priority, particularly where there is risk of fire or spontaneous combustion. Flame‐retardant materials can be employed to address these safety concerns without compromising the performance and efficiency of TENGs. The primary focus of this review is on flame‐retardant materials, including polymers, biomaterials, liquid polymers, aerogels, and carbon‐based materials. The fundamental properties of these materials for TENG applications are elucidated. The characteristics of each material type are described, along with their potential to boost the safety and performance of TENGs. The importance of flame retardancy in advancing TENG technology can be projected from its usage in wearable electronics, self‐powered sensors, and smart textiles. Current challenges such as material compatibility, fabrication complexity, and environmental concerns are addressed, along with proposed strategies for overcoming them. This review underscores the significance of flame‐retardant materials in strengthening the functionality and safety of TENG devices, paving the way for their widespread adoption across various industries.

Oxygen vacancies facilitate electron transfer, while elevated Ni valence boosts hydrophilicity and lowers hydrolysis barriers. The catalyst achieves ultra‐low overpotentials and significantly higher mass activity compared to Pt/C, showcasing a novel coordination design strategy.








Abstract
The unique hydrogen adsorption characteristics of negatively charged platinum play a crucial role in enhancing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. However, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are typically anchored to the support through non‐metallic atom bonds, resulting in a high oxidation state. Here, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are anchored in oxygen‐deficient NiFe‐LDH. Electron transfer between Pt and NiFe‐LDH occurs primarily through Pt─Ni bonds rather than the conventional Pt─O bonds. Oxygen vacancies in the NiFe‐LDH promote additional electron transfer from Ni to Pt, thereby reducing the valence state of Pt and enhancing hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, the elevated valence state of Ni increases the catalyst's hydrophilicity and reduces the energy barrier for hydrolysis dissociation. This catalyst demonstrates remarkably low overpotentials of 4 and 9 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 m KOH and 1 m KPi, respectively. Additionally, its mass activity is 51.5 and 23.7 times higher that of Pt/C, respectively. This study presents a novel strategy for enhancing electrocatalytic performance through the rational design of coordination environments and electronic structures in supported metal catalysts.

Herein, a novel inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel electrolyte is prepared via in situ sol‐gel polymerization. A high ion conductivity is achieved even under a lean‐water condition. Abundant polar functional groupstend to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thereby reducing the hydrogen evolution reaction. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits excellent performance in both symmetrical Al batteries and full batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) offer a promising avenue for achieving safe, high‐energy, and low‐cost large‐scale energy storage applications. However, the practical development of AAIBs is hindered by competitive reduction reactions in the aqueous solution, which lead to insufficient aluminum (Al) deposition and a severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HRE). In this work, an inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel with a stable silicon‐based network and multiple polar sites is successfully fabricated via an in situ sol‐gel polymerization method. The preferential formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar functional groups and water molecules effectively reduces the thermodynamic reactivity of water. Furthermore, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF‐SIMS) analyses confirm the formation of a stable, inorganic‐rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which kinetically suppresses undesirable side reactions. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 2.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, even under lean‐water conditions. As a result, Al|hydrogel|potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate (KNHCF) full cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 74.9 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and achieving an outstanding capacity retention of 90.0% after 200 cycles. Additionally, pouch cells exhibit stable open‐circuit voltage under various mechanical abuse conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Critical ingredients can revitalize magnesium‐metal anode in conventional electrolytes. Mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on Mg‐ion solvation structure regulation, interfacial evolution, solvent ionization, and weak interfacial passivation, have been especially underscored in terms of the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly‐passivated interphase properties.









Abstract
Multivalent‐metal batteries hold tremendous promise in solving safety and sustainability problems encountered by common lithium‐ion batteries, but the lack of ideal electrolyte solutions restricts their large‐scale adoption. Tuning electrolyte structures with functional ingredients, especially amines/methoxy‐based amines and phosphates, can revitalize multivalent‐metal anodes and high‐voltage cathodes in conventional electrolytes, unlocking their full potential. However, a rational and clear understanding of the implications of these ingredients, notwithstanding critically important to commercially available electrolyte design, has not been widely accepted. This concise perspective aims to provide timely analysis and discussion on ingredients’ functionalities of solvation shell speciation, interphase evolution, and consequently metal plating/stripping kinetics acceleration. In addition to prevailing coordination interactions, fresh understandings of intermolecular ionization/association and unique interphase formation are underscored by the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly passivated interphase properties. The existing understandings and proposed outlooks are expected to promote the next breakthroughs for rechargeable multivalent‐metal batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Near‐infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR‐ALINs) are fascinating due to their optical property of continuing to emit near‐infrared luminescence after excitation ceases. This review highlights recent progress in the rational design, modulation strategies and biological applications of NIR‐ALINs. The challenges and opportunities in this field are discussed with the aim of stimulating further developments in biological applications using NIR‐ALINs.








Abstract
Near‐infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR‐ALINs) possess the unique property of continuing to emit near‐infrared (NIR) luminescence after excitation ceases. They demonstrate excellent photostability, deep tissue penetration, and high imaging signal‐to‐noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, NIR‐ALINs can be re‐excited in vivo using visible (Vis), NIR light or X‐rays, which avoids the need for continuous in situ excitation, thus eliminating autofluorescence of biological tissues and reducing the tediousness of multiple injections. These features make NIR‐ALINs particularly attractive for biological applications. In recent years, a series of NIR‐ALINs with prolonged afterglow time and enhanced luminescence intensity have been discovered. However, the development of NIR‐ALINs still faces significant challenges, as their NIR afterglow performance is usually insufficient to satisfy practical biological applications. There is still a lack of systematic analysis of the strategies for the regulation of NIR afterglow luminescence in inorganic nanomaterials. This review highlights the rational design and modulation strategies of NIR‐ALINs, focusing on host substrate selection, trap engineering modulation and surface modification. Moreover, the biological applications of NIR‐ALINs in bioimaging, bio‐detection and disease therapy are summarized. Finally, the present challenges and perspectives in biological applications, such as insufficient afterglow properties and unclear biosafety, are also discussed.

<title>Skin‐Inspired and Self‐Regulated Hydrophobic Hydrogel for Diabetic Wound Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A skin‐mimetic smart hydrophobic hydrogel is developed for efficient diabetic wound therapy. Thehydrophobic segments form dense “epidermis”, ensuring prolonged drug diffusion, long‐term water retention, and high water content. Meanwhile, the responsive segments generate glucose‐labile “sweat pores”, facilitating on‐demand drug release to remodel the hostile wound microenvironment.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are refractory and recurrent diseases that necessitate the development of multifunctional dressings. Inspired by the structure and function of the skin, we herein delicately design a novel swollen hydrophobic hydrogel (QL@MAB) composed of hydrophobic methyl acrylate (MA) and (3‐acrylamidophenyl)boronic acid (AAPBA) network and co‐loaded with antioxidant quercetin (Q) and antibiotic levofloxacin (L) for efficient diabetic wound therapy. The hydrophobic MA segments undergo phase separation to form a dense “epidermis”, ensuring prolonged drug diffusion, long‐term water retention, and high water content. Meanwhile, the AAPBA segments generate glucose‐labile “sweat pores” via borate ester bonds with the polyphenol drug Q. Upon encountering the hyperglycemic wound microenvironment, the “sweat pores” are dilated due to the cleavage of the borate ester bonds and exposure of the diffusion channel, facilitating drug release for accelerated wound healing. In the infected diabetic rats, QL@MAB achieves rapid wound debridement and re‐epithelization while promoting angiogenesis, hair follicle regeneration, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Taken together, this study not only represents a multipronged dressing for effective interventions of diabetic wounds but also contributes to the rational design of smart hydrogels tailored for biomedical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Zero leakage, ultralong lifespan, and intrinsic opening sensing are achieved in microvalves, making it feasible to develop high‐performance fluid operation chips and integrated drive‐control systems, which promote the miniaturization, integration, and flexibility of pneumatic flexible robots and human‐machine interaction devices.








Abstract
Valves are critical components in advanced fluid control systems (AFCS) and play a vital role in applications such as soft robotics and medical devices. Traditional mechanical valves often suffer from issues such as leakage and wear, which compromise the efficiency and precision of air‐driven systems. Here, a superlubricity microvalve (SLMV) is developed with characteristics of zero leakage, ultralong lifespan, and self‐sensing capabilities. The SLMV demonstrates zero helium leakage at pressures exceeding 0.9 MPa, and remains defect‐free after one million collision tests and 5000 reciprocating sliding friction tests. Additionally, the valve features self‐powered sensing that can detect its own open status, and thus enhances the self‐feedback control. AFCS equipped with SLMVs may significantly improve the flexibility and functionality of pneumatic robots, facilitating the development of implantable drug delivery devices that are more durable, compact, safe, and reliable.

<title>Machine‐Learning‐Enhanced Trial‐and‐Error for Efficient Optimization of Rubber Composites</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces a novel workflow termed machine‐learning (ML)‐enhanced trial‐and‐error approach, for efficient optimization of rubber composites. This approach integrates orthogonal experimental design with symbolic regression to proficiently extract empirical principles. This integrated approach not only preserves the features of conventional trial‐and‐error methodologies but also substantially enhances their efficiency and effectiveness.








Abstract
The traditional trial‐and‐error approach, although effective, is inefficient for optimizing rubber composites. The latest developments in machine learning (ML)‐assisted methodologies are also not suitable for predicting and optimizing rubber composite properties. This is due to the dependency of the properties on processing conditions, which prevents the alignment of data collected from different sources. In this work, a novel workflow called the ML‐enhanced trial‐and‐error approach is proposed. This approach integrates orthogonal experimental design with symbolic regression (SR) to effectively extract empirical principles. This combination enables the optimization process to retain the characteristics of the traditional trial‐and‐error approach while significantly improving efficiency and capability. Using rubber composites as the model system, the ML‐enhanced trial‐and‐error approach effectively extracts empirical principles encapsulated by high‐frequency terms in the SR‐derived mathematical formulas, offering clear guidance for material property optimization. An online platform has been developed that allows for no‐code usage of the proposed methodology, designed to seamlessly integrate into the existing experimental optimization process.

<title>Synchronizing Multicolor Changes and Shape Deformation Into Structurally Homogeneous Hydrogels via a Single Photochromophore</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A spiropyran‐derived photochromphore that exhibits a concurrent molecular alteration in fluorescence and charge upon irradiation is reported, which simultaneously enables both photochromic and photodeformable capability upon covalent incorporation into a structurally homogenous hydrogel. The engineered hydrogel system demonstrates synchronized multicolor changes (from red to green) and shape deformation (from positive to negative phototropism) under a single stimulus of light illumination.








Abstract
The design of synthetic hydrogels that can mimic their biological counterparts in the simultaneous production of multicolor change and shape transformation in response to environmental stimuli is of great importance toward intelligent camouflage, encryption, and actuation. Previous efforts have focused primarily on developing heterogeneous hydrogels that highly rely on respective mechanisms to achieve color and shape changes separately, and synergistically synchronizing such two variations into structurally homogenous hydrogels via a single chromophore has been challenging. Here, the molecular design of a structurally homogenous hydrogel simultaneously exhibiting synchronized multicolor change and shape deformation triggered by a single stimulus of light is reported. The synchronization mechanism originates from a coupled alteration upon irradiation in the fluorescence emission and charge states of a spiropyran photochromophore covalently incorporated into the hydrogel network, thus leading to macroscale color change and shape variation in the hydrogel, respectively. Following this principle, both positive and negative phototropic deformation are obtained concomitantly with synchronized but flexibly tunable multicolor changes upon light illumination and demonstrated the ingenious application of biomimetic actuation, encryption, and camouflage by the rational combination of these two systems. This work represents an innovative molecular design strategy for developing bioinspired materials with synchronized functions via a single compound.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Increased reliance on renewable energy requires enhanced grid‐scale energy storage. The subject of this review, the high mass loading of electrodes, is critical for determining manufacturing costs. Several of the reviewed fabrication techniques surpass the mass loading of conventional electrodes and achieve values above 100 mg cm−2. These results represent an important step towards meeting future demands for grid storage.








Abstract
The increasing electrification of daily life as well as the intermittent characteristic of renewable energy sources require viable solutions for grid‐scale energy storage. Critical considerations for grid storage applications are electrode mass loading and electrode thickness as these features govern battery pack energy density, an important factor in determining manufacturing costs. For this reason, there is increased interest in finding new ways of creating electrodes with high mass loading. In this review, various high‐mass loading fabrication approaches are considered for positive electrode materials used in batteries. The benchmark used for high mass loading is above 20 mg cm−2, which is higher than the practical limit of conventional tape‐cast electrodes. Several different electrode approaches are described including templating, laser patterning, direct ink writing, and electrodeposition. A variety of materials are covered with the most prominent being LiFe(PO4) (LFP), LiCoO2(LCO), and MnO2. In research to date, scalable electrochemical performance has been achieved with mass loadings over 100 mg cm−2. Areal capacities as high as 14.7 mAh cm−2 at 1.82 mA cm−2 have been achieved in non‐aqueous electrolytes and 9.8 mAh cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2 in aqueous electrolytes. These results establish that the mass loading of electrodes can be scaled up without compromising their electrochemical properties.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting are achieved by utilizing the quantum‐confinement effect of MAPbBr3 QDs within the MOFs. This unique anticounterfeiting tag enables high PL intensity and visible recognition to the naked eye and allows for multiple authentications in both time and space dimensions. These results provide valuable insights for designing high‐security, high‐intensity multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting tags.








Abstract
Multicolor dynamic optical materials exhibit significant potential in the realms of anticounterfeiting and information encryption, benefitting from their capacity for generating unpredictable optical information that changes over time. Herein, a novel approach is presented utilizing quantum‐confinement effect of MAPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) embedded within lanthanide‐metal organic frameworks (Ln‐MOFs) for time‐resolved multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting applications. The dimensions of MAPbBr3 QDs undergo temporal variations during in situ growth, resulting in dynamic alterations in luminescent color due to the quantum‐confinement effect. Furthermore, the emission colors of MAPbBr3@Eu‐MOFs can be modulated by varying UV excitation wavelengths, thereby conferring a spatially distinguishable anticounterfeiting dimension. The time‐resolved unpredictability of these dynamic color changes coupled with sustained luminescent intensity and multi‐dimensional anticounterfeiting, render them suitable system for advanced graphical coding. These findings pave the way for the advancement of intelligent multicolor dynamic optical anticounterfeiting.

<title>Anomalous Nonlinear Magnetoconductivity in van der Waals Magnet CrSBr</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Anomalous nonlinear magnetoconductivity (NLMC) is demonstrated by manipulating internal magnetic orders in van der Waals magnet CrSBr interfaced by hBN layer. The anomalous NLMC presents multiple resistance states governed by both magnetization vector and Néel vector utilizing the metamagnetic transition of CrSBr. This anomalous NLMC of the engineered CrSBr system promises efficient electrical readout of multiple magnetic information.








Abstract
Nonlinear magnetoconductivity (NLMC) is a nonreciprocal transport response arising in non‐centrosymmetric materials. However, this ordinary NLMC signal vanishes at zero magnetic field, limiting its potential for applications. Here, the observation of an anomalous NLMC controlled by internal order parameters such as the magnetization or Néel vectors is reported. This response is achieved by breaking both inversion and time‐reversal symmetry in artificial van der Waals heterostructures based on the magnetic CrSBr and insulating hBN. The nonreciprocal signal can be tuned between two different states in ferromagnetic monolayer CrSBr and among four different states in antiferromagnetic bilayer CrSBr, thanks to its metamagnetic transition. Remarkably, this output signal in the ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) state of CrSBr is three (one) orders of magnitude higher than those previously measured. A conductivity scaling analysis reveals the Berry connection polarizability as the origin of the anomalous NLMC. The results pave the way for high‐frequency rectifiers with magnetically switchable output polarity as well as for an efficient electrical readout of the magnetic state of antiferromagnetic materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
I additive manufacturing process exploits the spatial propagation of a polymerization reaction front to produce 3D polymer parts 10× faster and 1000× more energy efficient  than the fastest stereolithography. In contrast with existing 3D printing, this morphogenic process is inspired by biological “growth and form” due to the self‐directed propagation of the reaction.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's morphogenesis, a new 3D printing process –growth printing (GP)– takes advantage of a self‐propagating curing front to produce 3D polymeric parts following a growth‐like development plan. The propagation of the curing front is driven by the exothermic polymerization of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), which transforms the liquid resin into a stiff polymer as it propagates at 1 mm s−1. GP is triggered when a heated initiator contacts the uncured liquid resin in an open container. The initiator nucleates the frontal polymerization reaction and the isotropic radial propagation of the growth front. Simultaneously, the initiator is moved up across the free surface of the resin, pulling the cured object out of the uncured resin. The motion trajectory of the initiator with respect to the free resin surface controls the growth morphology of the 3D part. An inverse design algorithm is developed to produce 3D parts by modeling the reaction‐diffusion‐driven solidification process. This process has substantial energy savings and high printing speeds.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The SnO2/ZnSb2O6‐x double electron transport layer promotes a highly ordered arrangement of the perovskite lattice, improving film quality and suppressing non‐radiative recombination, which in turn enhances carrier transport and overall device performance. Under photothermal conditions, ZnSb2O6‐x effectively captures oxygen atoms at the SnO2 interface, preventing ion migration and thereby enhancing the photothermal operational stability of PSCs.








Abstract
Stability testing protocols from the International Summit on Organic and Hybrid Solar Cell Stability (ISOS) are essential for standardizing studies on the photothermally operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Under photothermal conditions, the migration of oxygen from SnO2 layer induces cationic dehydrogenation at the A‐site of the perovskite, accelerating degradation to PbI2. This leads to the formation of photoinduced I2 and Pb0 defects, significantly compromising long‐term stability. In this study, ordonezite (ZnSb2O6‐x) as a multifunctional electron transport layer (ETL) that captures migrating oxygen atoms at the SnO2/perovskite interface is introduced, effectively preventing degradation of the buried interface. Additionally, the lattice match between ZnSb2O6‐x and perovskite facilitates well‐ordered perovskite film growth. As a result, PSCs featuring ZnSb2O6‐x ETLs achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 25.02% and retained 90.62% of their initial performance after 1000 h under the ISOS‐D‐2 protocol. Furthermore, devices demonstrated remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 83.69% of their original performance after 800 h of maximum power point tracking at 85 °C, meeting the stringent ISOS‐L‐2 protocol requirements.

This work introduces a programmable photonic analog‐to‐digital converter (ADC), leveraging phase‐change materials (PCMs) and foundry‐based silicon photonics. 2‐ and 4‐bit ADCs with zero quantization energy are achieved by the programmable and non‐volatile nature of PCMs. The photonic ADC can reach a resolution of 8‐bit with 65‐state PCMs. An all‐optical analog‐to‐digital conversion is successfully demonstrated, marking a significant advancement in efficient high‐speed photonic processing.








Abstract
High‐performance signal processing and telecommunication systems absolutely necessitate analog‐to‐digital converters (ADCs) that offer extensive bandwidth, exceptional precision, and minimal power consumption, in order to efficiently convert real‐world analog signals into digital signals. While current electronic ADCs are constrained by limitations such as low bandwidth, high jitter noise, susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, and excessive energy consumption, photonic ADCs present promising solutions to overcome these challenges. Here, a programmable photonic ADC is developed by integrating phase‐change materials (PCMs) with silicon photonics fabricated using foundry processes. Thanks to the programmability and non‐volatile nature of PCMs, 2‐ and 4‐bit photonic ADCs are demonstrated on a single chip, achieving zero energy consumption during the quantization. Through the experimental demonstration of 65‐state PCMs, photonic ADCs can attain a resolution of 8‐bit, marking a significant milestone as the highest resolution reported to date for ADCs leveraging optical technologies. As a proof of concept, an all‐optical analog‐to‐digital conversion system is demonstrated by integrating 2‐bit photonic ADCs with optical sampling using a mode‐locked laser (MLL). This system achieves the conversion of a 321 MHz radio frequency (RF) signal at a sampling rate of 40 MS s−1. The programmable, energy‐efficient, and high‐speed photonic ADCs represent a significant advancement in the evolution of signal processing systems.

This work presents a novel system for next‐generation spintronic THz emitting sources based on 5d oxides that operate at room temperature. By interfacing a SrIrO3 epitaxial film with ultra‐thin ferromagnetic materials and using femtosecond spin injection THz emission spectroscopy, this system confirms the generation of electromagnetic waves at the THz frequency.








Abstract
Oxide interfaces have enormous potential for future electronics with many applications, such as large spin Hall conductance, phase transitions, topological states, and superconductivity. However, previous investigations have predominantly focused on gigahertz frequencies; whilst the possibilities to fabricate devices operational at terahertz frequencies are demonstrated. A model solution is proposed employing 5d rare‐earth, strontium iridate (SrIrO3) heterostructure with cobalt (Co) ultrathin layers. Femtosecond lasers are used to photoexcite the spins in Co, which super diffuse into the SrIrO3 layer to produce an ultrafast inverse spin Hall effect in sub‐picosecond timescales. The devices exploit the external magnetic field and laser fluence to control the spin polarization from the Co layer and demonstrate a tailored spin Hall effect. These results thus pave paths for next‐generation ultrafast oxide electronics offering possibilities for room temperature‐based devices.

Testing diverse biomolecules and observing their dynamic interaction in complex biological systems in a label‐free manner is critically important for THz absorption spectroscopy. A compact and multifunctional THz plasmonic biosensing platform by leveraging multiple interfering resonances from quasi‐bound states in the continuum designed to noninvasively and in situ track the temporal evolution of molecules in multiple analyte systems is proposed.








Abstract
Testing diverse biomolecules and observing their dynamic interaction in complex biological systems in a label‐free manner is critically important for terahertz (THz) absorption spectroscopy. However, traditionally employed micro/nanophotonic techniques suffer from a narrow operating resonance and strong absorption band interference from polar solutions preventing seriously reliable, on‐demand biosensor integration. Here, a multifunctional THz plasmonic biosensing platform by leveraging multiple interfering resonances from quasi‐bound states in the continuum designed to noninvasively and in situ track the temporal evolution of molecules in multiple analyte systems, is proposed. In contrast to conventional microphotonic sensors, this platform demonstrates substantially broadband performance and reduced footprints, allowing for simultaneous detection of diverse molecular vibrant at multiple spectral points through robust near‐field interactions. Furthermore, this sensor enables real‐time analysis of amino acid absorption as water evaporates despite its strong overlapping absorption bands in the THz range. By utilizing the real‐time format of the reflectance method to acquire a comprehensive spectro‐temporal data collection, this approach supports developing a deep neural network to discriminate and predict the composition and proportion of multiple mixtures, obviating the need for frequency scanning or microfluidic devices. This approach offers innovative viewpoints for exploring biological processes and provides valuable tools for biological analysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 vdWH heterostructure polarized photodetector is introduced, which possesses the capability to simultaneously measure both the linear polarization angle and the degree of polarization. This device demonstrates bias‐switchable polarization detection over a wide spectral range, and exhibits a bipolar photoresponse even at zero bias. Taking advantage of these unique properties, the photodetector has been successfully applied in imaging scenarios and has also been simulated for use in dual coding communication.








Abstract
On‐chip polarized photodetectors play a crucial role in advancing ultra‐compact optoelectronic devices for next‐generation technologies. However, simultaneously detecting the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) and the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) within a single device remains a challenging task, particularly due to the inherently weak polarization states found in naturally anisotropic materials. In this paper, it is reported on the development of a twisted monopole barrier photodetector based on a PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 configuration. This photodetector features a rapid response time of 7–12 µs. In an imaging demonstration, it operates as a single‐polarization photodetector, reconstructing AoLP and DoLP distributions of target objects through bias‐switchable polarization detection across a wide spectral range, all without the plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures or polarization filters. Additionally, it demonstrates bipolar characteristics under zero‐bias conditions at room temperature, enabling dual‐binary coding for polarimetric‐encoded communication. These combination of features positions the photodetector as a highly promising candidate for on‐chip applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The stability of the electrolyte‐electrode interface plays a crucial role in aqueous Zn/I2 batteries and is largely determined by the properties of the electrolyte and separator. Herein, a sulfonic acid‐rich electrolyte additive and separator are designed to suppress the shuttling effect and side reactions, and the electrolyte additive and separator impact the interface stability of Zn/I2 batteries is investigated.








Abstract
The electrolyte‐electrode interface plays a crucial role in aqueous Zn/I2 battery and is largely determined by the properties of electrolyte and separator. Here, the synergistic effect of sulfonic acid‐rich electrolyte additive and separator impacts the interface stability of Zn/I2 batteries is comprehensively investigated using operando synchrotron‐based Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy, cryo‐electron microscopy, and in situ spectroscopy. As a case study, a cost‐effective additive known as lignosulfonic acid sodium (LAS) and a flexible sulfonated polyether sulfone membrane are employed to facilitate the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the Zn anode and effectively suppress the shuttle effect. The chemisorption of LAS on Zn, its interaction with Zn2+, and the impact on the Zn desolvation process are systematically investigated through both theoretical simulations and operando measurements. Furthermore, the formation of an in situ SEI consisting of ZnS and ZnF2 is identified, which facilitates the uniform nucleation and planar plating of Zn(002), while effectively suppressing detrimental side reactions. Additionally, visualization experiments and in situ spectroscopy confirm that R−SO3− groups effectively impede the shuttle process of I3−/I5− anions through electrostatic repulsion. This work provides valuable insights for designing robust electrolyte interfaces for high‐performance aqueous Zn/I2 batteries.

<title>Superconductivity in PrNiO2 Infinite‐Layer Nickelates</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study unveils a superconducting state in undoped parent compound PrNiO2 thin films, challenging previous views on nickelate superconductivity. Through scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques, the research demonstrates the high structural quality and distinct electronic properties of the thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. While requiring an independent verification, this result suggests that the self‐doping mechanism is sufficient for superconductivity and the reported phase diagram of infinite‐layer nickelates might need a revision.








Abstract
Several reports about infinite‐layer nickelate thin films suggest that the superconducting critical temperature versus chemical doping phase diagram has a dome‐like shape, similar to cuprates. Here, a highly reproducible superconducting state in undoped PrNiO2 thin films grown on SrTiO3 are demonstrated. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements show coherent infinite‐layer phase with no visible stacking‐fault defects, an overall high structural quality where possible unintentional chemical doping or interstitial oxygen, if present, sum well below the measurable threshold of the technique. X‐ray absorption measurements show very sharp features at the Ni L3,2‐edges with a large linear dichroism, indicating the preferential hole occupation of Ni1+‐3dx2−y2${\rm d}_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in a square planar geometry. Resonant inelastic X‐ray scattering measurements reveal sharp magnon excitations of 200 meV energy at the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, highly resonant at the Ni1 + absorption peak. The results indicate that, when properly stabilized, infinite‐layer nickelate thin films are superconducting without chemical doping.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a synergistic strategy that utilizes bidentate chelating diethyldithiocarbamate as surface ligands for cadmium‐free quantum dots (QDs), which enhances the ligand binding on the QD surface and improves stress dissipation under bending. Consequently, the resulting flexible devices exhibit peak external quantum efficiencies above 15% and retain over 90% of their initial performance after 5000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible light‐emitting diodes utilizing environmentally friendly cadmium (Cd)‐free quantum dots (QDs) hold immense potential for next‐generation wearable integrated displays. However, their overall performance lags behind Cd‐based counterparts, and less research focuses on the suitability of QD layers in flexible devices. Herein, it is observed that the traditional surface oleate ligands on QDs readily detach under device operation after cycling bending, leading to increased surface defects and accumulated tensile stress in QDs layers, further diminishing their photoluminescence and electroluminescence performance. Based on these insights, a synergetic regulation strategy is developed employing a short‐chain bidentate chelating ligand, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), to strengthen the binding of QDs with ligands, minimizing ligand detaching and consequently inhibiting the non‐radiative recombination of QDs; Meanwhile, the short‐chain DDTC also reduces the inter‐dot spatial distance and decreases the Young's modulus in QDs films, effectively dissipating stress localization and retaining the film morphology upon bending. Consequently, the resulting flexible devices based on blue ZnSeTe/ZnSe/ZnS QDs and green/red InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs demonstrate the peak external quantum efficiencies of above 15% and maintain over 90% after 5000 bending cycles, rivaling state‐of‐the‐art Cd‐based flexible devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A flexible ionic synaptic device is developed to replicate the brain's ion transport and ephaptic coupling mechanisms, enabling efficient energy consumption and complex connectivity. By using ions for signal transmission, the device achieves spatiotemporal signal integration, mimicking the computational capabilities of biological neural networks. This work advances the development of brain‐like AI systems with enhanced connectivity and processing efficiency.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices are designed to replicate the energy‐efficient information processing advantages found in biological neural networks by emulating the working mechanisms of neurons and synapses. However, most existing neuromorphic devices focus primarily on functionally mimicking biological synapses, with insufficient emphasis on ion transport mechanisms. This limitation makes it challenging to achieve the complexity and connectivity inherent in biological systems, such as ephaptic coupling. Here, an ionic biomimetic synaptic device based on a flexible ion‐gel nanofiber network is proposed, which transmits information and enables ephaptic coupling through capacitance formation by ion transport with an extremely low energy consumption of just 6 femtojoules. The hysteretic ion transport behavior endows the device with synaptic‐like memory effects, significantly enhancing the performance of the reservoir computing system for classifying the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and demonstrating high efficiency in edge learning. More importantly, the devices in an array establish communication connections, exhibiting global oscillatory behaviors similar to ephaptic coupling in biological neural networks. This connectivity enables the array to perform working memory tasks, paving the way for developing brain‐like systems characterized by high complexity and vast connectivity.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A 570 meV emission shift is achieved through surface‐enhanced Landau damping during phase transitions. In crystalline Sb₂Te₃, localized surface plasmons facilitate hot‐electron injection, shifting the emission energy from 1.64 to 2.21 eV. This tunability is further enhanced by applying a DC voltage bias, making it suitable for integration with on‐chip quantum photonic systems.








Abstract
Tuning quantum emission to a specific wavelength at room temperature holds significant promise for enhancing secure quantum communication, particularly by aligning with the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum. The integration of quantum emitters with phase‐change materials enables emission wavelength modulation, especially when strong field enhancement is present. Antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) exhibits the potential to facilitate this functionality through its support of interband plasmonics and phase‐change behavior. In this study, Sb₂Te₃ antennae are designed and fabricated to tune the emission energy of adjacent perovskite quantum dots (QDs) by over 570 meV. The underlying mechanism involves the localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on Sb₂Te₃ nanostructures, which exhibit a surface‐enhanced Landau damping process that facilitates the decay of LSPs into electron‐hole pairs. The generated hot electrons are then injected into perovskite QDs via the microscopic electron transport process, which can be triggered by the transition of Sb2Te3 from amorphous to a crystalline state, resulting in a significant emission energy shift from 1.64 to 2.21 eV. Furthermore, the emission energy of perovskite QDs on crystalline Sb₂Te₃ nanoantennae can be modulated through DC voltage bias, highlighting the potential for extensive wavelength tunability of quantum emitters integrated with electronic systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Three morphologies of spinel catalysts for the decomposition of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are prepared by hydrothermal method. The optimization of morphology made a positive impact on PET conversion, yield of bis(2‐hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), and photocatalytic performance. Catalyst with octahedral morphology has an optimum content of oxygen vacancies, which can work as active sites to promote PET degradation.








Abstract
Thermocatalytic recycling of plastics is typically constrained by high energy input requirements, resulting in poor economic efficiency and necessitating the utilization of light power. Indeed, photothermal catalysis offers several advantages over traditional photocatalysis and enables more efficient use of light energy. In this study, unique octahedral spinel‐structured cobalt manganese oxide (CoMn2O4) catalysts are prepared. CoMn2O4 acts as both a photothermal reagent and catalyst, demonstrating low light intensity requirements, high conversion rates, enhanced reactivity, and superior stability during polyethylene terephthalate (PET) glycolysis via photothermocatalysis. Oxygen vacancies created on CoMn2O4 facilitate PET glycolysis by providing reactive sites that promote nucleophilic addition and subsequent elimination reactions. The spinel structure of CoMn2O4 ensures high thermal stability, while the octahedral configuration enhances the optical absorption coefficient and photothermal conversion efficiency. Under identical conditions, the PET conversion efficiency of CoMn2O4 in photothermal catalysis is 3.1 times higher than under purely thermal conditions, while maintaining high selectivity for high‐value monomers. This study presents a new catalyst design approach for highly efficient upcycling of plastics, highlighting its substantial potential in this field.

<title>Long‐Lasting Solid‐State Aluminum Battery with High‐Areal‐Capacity Enabled by In Situ Polymerization Strategy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An in situ polymerization strategy is rationally proposed to synthesize cross‐linked polymer solid‐state electrolyte and polymer‐encapsulated graphite cathode, which achieves intimate interface contact, dendrite free, flame retardancy, and confined volume expansion, enabling a solid‐state aluminum‐graphite battery with high‐areal‐capacity, high‐safety, and long‐lasting lifespan.








Abstract
Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) attract intense interest due to their low‐cost, high‐capacity, and high‐safety using nonflammable chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs). However, Al dendrite growth, interface degradation, and corrosiveness remain challenges in these ILEs. Herein, an ultrastable solid‐state aluminum battery (SAB) based on a cross‐linked polymer solid‐state electrolyte (PSE) and a PSE‐encapsulated graphite (PG) cathode is constructed via an in situ polymerization strategy, which maintains battery safety and realizes a synergy of interface compatibility between PSE/PG and PSE/Al interfaces. The PSE has a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 4.15 × 10−3 S cm−1 and a low corrosiveness to Al anode, ensuring rapid and continuous transportation of chloroaluminate ions and homogeneous plating/stripping of metallic Al. In addition, the volume expansion of the PG cathode is almost negligible owing to the confinement effect of graphite within the cross‐linked polymer skeleton. As a consequence, the assembled SAB demonstrates high areal capacity (0.67 mAh cm−2 at 0.1 mA cm−2), good rate performance, and impressive cycling stability (no capacity attenuation after 10 000 cycles). Such in situ polymerization strategy shows a broader promise for the development of safe and stable RABs in energy storage applications.

Abstract
2D materials possess exceptional carrier transport properties and mechanical stability despite their ultrathin nature. In this context, the coupling between polarization fields and photoelectric fields has been proposed to modulate the physical properties of 2D materials, including energy band structure, carrier mobility, as well as the dynamic processes of photoinduced carriers. These strategies have led to significant improvements in the performance, functionality, and integration density of 2D materials ‐based photodetectors. The present review introduces the coupling of photoelectric field with four fundamental polarization fields, delivered from dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric effects, focusing on their synergistic coupling mechanisms, distinctive properties, and technological merits in advanced photodetection applications. More importantly, it sheds light on the new path of material synthesis and novel structure design to improve the efficiency of the coupling strategies in photodetectors. Then, research advances on the synergy of multi‐polarization effects and photoelectric effect in the domain of bionic photodetectors are highlighted. Finally, the review outlines the future research perspectives of coupling strategies in 2D materials‐based photodetectors and proposes potential solutions to address the challenges issues of this area. This comprehensive overview will guide futural fundamental and applied research that capitalizes on coupling strategies for sensitive and intelligent photodetection.

<title>Double‐Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Dynamic Strength of over 90 GPa Enhanced by Intershell Friction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The ultraviolet laser irradiation is used to cut off the outer shell of double‐walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). A velocity‐dependent intershell friction occurs between the outer and inner shells. This friction results from dynamic localized commensurate contacts. The friction‐induced intershell locking enhances the dynamic strength of DWCNTs to over 90 GPa, indicating that DWCNTs possess exceptional resistance to high‐velocity impacts.








Abstract
Low‐dimensional ultra‐strong nanomaterials have attracted great anticipation for applications under extreme dynamic conditions. A photocatalytic method is developed to selectively cut off the outer shell of double‐walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), achieving non‐contact measurement of intershell friction with both high temporal and spatial resolutions at high sliding velocities under optical microscope. The intershell friction linearly increases with the sliding velocity, with a slope related to intershell distance and chirality of DWCNTs. The maximum measured friction reaches 194.1 ± 7.3 nN at a sliding velocity of 977 mm s−1, a value comparable to the tensile force (≈450 nN) for breaking the outer shell. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the velocity‐dependent intershell friction is related to dynamic localized commensurate contacts. The friction‐induced “intershell locking” enhances the effective dynamic strength of DWCNTs from 64.8 ± 3.4 GPa to 90.1 ± 4.0 GPa at a tensile strain rate of 3300 s−1. This study reveals anomalous friction mechanisms at nanoscale and demonstrates promising application of DWCNTs as ultra‐strong materials.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By proposing a single‐cell order‐decoupling method and simultaneously manipulating four‐dimensional optical parameters (Wavelength, Wavevector Direction, Polarization, and Diffraction Order), a meta‐optics storage system accomplishes multidimensional optical encryption. This system achieves up to sixteen‐channel multidimensional encrypted holographic images with high quality and exponentially raises the threshold of brute‐force decoding, and thus remarkably enhances information security in optical storage.









Abstract
Recent advancements in multidimensional multiplexing have paved the way for meta‐optics encryption to be a viable solution to next‐generation information storage and encryption security. However, challenges persist in increasing simultaneously modulated dimensions while minimizing structural complexity. Here, a novel single‐cell order‐decoupling method is proposed for the realization of a multidimensional encrypted meta‐optics storage system. By analyzing the mathematic relationships between the phases of different diffraction orders, the detour phase structure is optimized to achieve independent encoding freedom for multiple orders. The proposed multidimensional encrypted meta‐optics successfully realize the concurrent modulation of four optical dimensions: i) Wavelength, ii) Wavevector Direction, iii) Polarization, and iv) Diffraction Order. The system achieves up to sixteen‐channel meta‐holograms with low crosstalk and exponentially raises the threshold of brute‐force decoding and thus remarkably enhances the information security in optical storage. It envisioned that the on‐chip metasurface‐based multidimensional encrypted strategy for augmented reality display functionalities presents promising applications in optical encryption/storage, anti‐counterfeiting, and multifunctional photonics integrated circuits.

<title>Spontaneous Charging from Sliding Water Drops Determines the Interfacial Deposition of Charged Solutes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
When water drops slide on hydrophobic surfaces, they spontaneously leave behind negative charges along their path, resulting in the drops becoming positively charged. Here, it is shown that this phenomenon, known as slide electrification, influences the deposition of charged dissolved molecules. Using charged fluorophores and biomolecules, a preferential deposition of cations along the drop's trail is demonstrated, following the charge distribution pattern.








Abstract
It has been discovered during the last decade that when water drops slide on hydrophobic surfaces, they spontaneously leave negative charges along the drop path. The drops become positively charged with a potential of 1 kV. This process, called slide electrification, influences drop motion and alters contact angles. Here, a third effect of slide electrification is demonstrated: the preferential deposition of dissolved solutes with positive charges. To illustrate this, water drops containing dissolved charged fluorophore ions are allowed to slide down a tilted hydrophobic surface, and their track is imaged. Two perylene derivatives are applied as fluorophores, one chromophore carrying positive charges, PDI+, and one carrying negative charges, PDI─. PDI+ is deposited at a concentration as low as 0.5 µm. In contrast, PDI─ is only deposited above 5 µm. Experiments using grounded drops or a hydrophobic coating on a conducting substrate indicate that the electric field generated from the negative surface charges behind the drop causes a preferential deposition of the dissolved ions near the interface. This hypothesis also agrees with Kelvin probe measurements. Complex biomolecules deposition e.g. DNA can be also affected by this. These findings contribute to a better understanding of mass transfer processes at interfaces.

Bimetallic nitrides supported RuNi alloy (RuNi/ZrNiNx) epitaxial heterostructure as a bifunctional catalyst achieves highly stable and active hydrogen and oxygen evolution at ampere‐scale current densities. Charge redistribution induced high‐valence Zr promotes the water dissociation, electron‐deficient Ru facilitates H desorption, and the hollow site of tri‐coordinated Ni in NiNx that is adjacent to Zr atom favors the energetically favorable O2 production.








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis represents a pivotal technology for green hydrogen production yet faces critical challenges including limited current density and high energy input. Herein, a heterostructured bimetallic nitrides supported RuNi alloy (RuNi/ZrNiNx) is developed through in situ epitaxial growth under ammonolysis, achieving exceptional bifunctional activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 m KOH electrolyte. The RuNi/ZrNiNx exhibits a HER current density of −2 A cm−2 at an overpotential of 392.8 mV, maintaining initial overpotential after 1000 h continuous electrolysis at −500 mA cm−2. For OER, it delivers a current density of 2 A cm−2 at 1.822 V versus RHE, and sustains stable operation for 705 h at 500 mA cm−2. Experimental and theoretical studies unveil that the charge redistribution‐induced high‐valence Zr centers effectively polarize H─O bonds and promote water dissociation, and the electron‐deficient interface Ru sites optimize hydrogen desorption kinetics. Dynamic OH spillovers from Zr sites to the adjacent tri‐coordinated Ni hollow sites in NiNx promote rapid *OH intermediate desorption and active site regeneration. Notably, the tri‐coordinated Ni hollow sites in NiNx proximal to Zr atoms exhibit tailored adsorption strength for oxo‐intermediates, enabling a more energetically favorable pathway for O2 production.

<title>Upconversion Nanoparticle‐Covalent Organic Framework Core–shell Particles as Therapeutic Microrobots Trackable With Optoacoustic Imaging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Upconversion nanoparticle‐covalent organic framework core–shell particles provide enhanced contrast for optoacoustic imaging by leveraging the optical absorption of upconversion luminescence within the covalent organic framework matrix. Beyond their role as contrast agents, these particles enable customizable therapeutic agent loading and release, as well as magnetic microrobotic steering within vascular environments.








Abstract
Despite the development of various medical imaging contrast agents, integrating contrast signal generation with therapeutic and microrobotic functions remains challenging without complicated fabrication processes. In this study, upconversion nanoparticle‐covalent organic framework (UCNP‐COF) core–shell sub‐micron particles are developed that function as therapeutic microrobots trackable with multi‐spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and can be loaded with desired therapeutic molecular agents in a customizable manner. The mechanism of optoacoustic signal generation in UCNP‐COF particles is attributed to the quenching of upconversion luminescence emitted by the UCNPs, which is absorbed by the encapsulating COF and subsequently converted into acoustic waves. Unlike other microparticulate agents previously imaged with MSOT, UCNP‐COF particles do not pose concerns about their stability and biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the mesoporous texture of the COF provides a large surface area, allowing for the efficient loading of various drug molecules, which can be released at target sites. Furthermore, the magnetic UCNP‐COF Janus particles can be magnetically navigated through in vivo vasculature while being visualized in real‐time with volumetric MSOT. This study proposes an approach to design photonic materials with multifunctionality, enabling high‐performance medical imaging, drug delivery, and microrobotic manipulation toward their future potential clinical use.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A strongly coupled multisite anode electrocatalyst with cluster‐scale ruthenium‐tungsten oxide (Ru‐WOx) interface is developed for alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), which could simultaneously achieve high coverage of hydroxyl (OHad) and hydrogen (Had) at Ru and WOx domains, respectively. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm−2 with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mgRu cm−2 and outstanding durability.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is a more cost‐effective alternative to platinum anode catalysts for alkaline anion‐exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), but suffers from severe competitive adsorption of hydrogen (Had) and hydroxyl (OHad). To address this concern, a strongly coupled multisite electrocatalyst with highly active cluster‐scale ruthenium‐tungsten oxide (Ru‐WOx) interface, which could eliminate the competitive adsorption phenomenon and achieve high coverage of OHad and Had at Ru and WOx domains, respectively, is designed. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that WOx domain functions as a proton sponge to perpetually accommodate the activated hydrogen species that spillover from the adjacent Ru domain, and the resulting WO‐Had species are readily coupled with Ru‐OHad at the heterointerface to finish the hydrogen oxidation reaction with faster kinetics via the thermodynamically favorable Tafel‐Volmer mechanism. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm−2 with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mgRu cm−2 and outstanding durability (negligible voltage decay over 80‐h operation at 500 mA cm−2). This work offers completely new insights into understanding the alkaline HOR mechanism and designing advanced anode catalysts for AEMFCs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The heart organoid model exhibits the acidic microenvironment characteristic of myocardial infarction, which emerges as a pivotal force propelling the movement of micro‐robots. These micro‐robots, administered through microneedles, can penetrate deep into the tissue, effectively delivering therapeutic payloads to facilitate heart repair.








Abstract
Post‐myocardial infarction (MI), the rapid decrease in pH triggers myocardial cell acidosis, which compromises the therapeutic efficacy of exosomes in MI. The groundbreaking research in the human cardiac organoid MI model suggests that exosomes, when paired with pH adjustment, dramatically reduce cardiomyocyte mortality while maintaining their proliferative potential, underscoring the importance of pH regulation in myocardial preservation. Micro‐robot mounted micro‐needle (MN) patch is thus proposed, targeting MI‐acidic microenvironmet, to deliver exosomes into deep injured tissue. Upon injection, the patch base releases VEGF‐laden nanoparticles adhering to the infarcted myocardium. The smart patch is found not only 3D reconstructs the vascular network in MI regions but also effectively saves cardiomyocytes in rats. Furthermore, the minimally invasive delivery of MN patches are also verified to hearts of rabbits and pigs via thoracoscopic surgery underscores. These findings suggest that precise regulation of the microenvironment is a key to improving treatment outcomes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study proposes tribenzyl organic cation carried multidentate X‐type Lewis soft base to enhance adhesion and passivate defects simultaneously, aiming to achieve foldable and efficient perovskite nanocrystal‐based light‐emitting diodes. The resulting pure red F‐PeLEDs exhibit a recorded high EQE of 16.2% and robust mechanical properties to endure 5000 folding cycles with small radius of 1 mm.








Abstract
Lead‐halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) exhibit significant potential for advancing foldable perovskite light‐emitting diodes (F‐PLEDs) due to their discrete crystalline morphology, bright emission across an extensive color gamut, and remarkable color purity; however, their progression remains in the early stages with the concerns of inadequate performance and mechanical instability. This study proposes a ligand strategy employing tribenzyl organic cation (tribenzylamine, TBA) carried multidentate X‐type Lewis soft base (sodium acid pyrophosphate, SAPP) to address the challenges above simultaneously. Specifically, the use of multibranched aromatic ligands considerably improved the adhesion force between PNCs and adjacent layers, enhancing mechanical stability during folding, while the control sample shows deleterious cracks. Additionally, TBA‐SAPP ligands effectively eliminate the defects in PNC film, yielding exceptional photoluminescence properties with a near‐unity quantum yield. Consequently, the multifunctional ligands improved F‐PLEDs to achieve a record‐high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 16.2% compared to the previously reported pure‐red flexible PLEDs and display substantially improved spectral and operational stability. Equally important, these devices demonstrate robust mechanical properties, enduring a small folding radius of 1 mm for 5000 cycles. This ligand strategy is anticipated to inspire relevant research in PNCs and promote the realization of highly efficient and mechanically stable F‐PLEDs.

<title>Unveiling the Origin of Oxygen Framework Stability in Ultra‐High Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The origin of oxygen framework stability is studied by integrating high covalent element Mo into the bulk and surface of ultra‐high nickel cathode materials through a one‐step method. Mo with strong covalency can suppress Li/Ni antisite defects and reduce Li‐O‐Li configurations, thus suppressing irreversible phase transition and stabilizing the oxygen framework structure at high voltage.








Abstract
Ultra‐high nickel layered oxides are recognized as promising cathode candidates for high‐energy‐density lithium‐ion batteries due to their enhanced overall capacity and elevated operating voltage. However, the interlayer sliding of transition metal‐oxygen octahedra (TMO6) and the instability of lattice oxygen at high voltages for ultra‐high nickel oxide cathodes pose significant challenges to their development. Herein, the origin of oxygen framework stability is investigated by incorporating high‐covalent element Mo in both bulk and surface using a one‐step integrated method for ultra‐high nickel cathode material LiNi0.92Co0.08O2. It is revealed that apart from the isolation and protection effect of the Mo‐enriched surface layer, the suppression of Li/Ni antisite defects by Mo6+ with strong covalency in the bulk plays a critical role in reducing the configurations of the activated anionic redox reaction and stabilizing the lattice oxygen and oxygen framework structure. Benefiting from this, the reversibility of anionic redox reaction and the stability of oxygen framework is significantly enhanced, enabling more oxidized oxygen to exist in the form of oxygen dimer ions O2n−$O_2^{n - }$ rather than being lost as gaseous O2. Consequently, the modified ultra‐high nickel material demonstrates improved diffusion kinetics and optimized electrochemical performance at high voltage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Acid etching assisted direct upcycling strategy that selectively removals rock‐salt phases on the surface of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and dissociating polycrystalline structure to single crystals simultaneously, facilitating direct repair of its composition and structure via simple solid‐state sintering. The regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits comparable capacity and more excellent electrochemical stability to commercialized ones.








Abstract
Direct recycling of cathode materials has attracted phenomenal attention due to its economic and eco‐friendly advantages. However, existing direct recycling technologies are difficult to apply to highly degraded layered materials as the accumulation of thick rock‐salt phases on their surfaces not only blocks lithiation channels but also is thermodynamically difficult to transform into layered phases. Here, a surface engineering‐assisted direct upcycling strategy that reactivates the lithium diffusion channels at the highly degraded cathode surfaces using acid etching explored. Acid can selectively remove the electrochemically inert rock‐salt phases on the surface while simultaneously dissociating the degraded polycrystalline structure to single crystals, thereby reducing the thermodynamic barrier of the relithiation process and enhancing the stability of the regenerated cathode. This strategy can restore the capacity of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 from 59.7 to 165.4 mAh g−1, comparable to that of commercialized ones. The regenerated cathode also exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with a capacity retention of 80.1% at 1 C after 500 cycles within 3.0–4.2 V (vs graphite) in pouch‐type full cells. In addition, the generality of this strategy has also been validated on Ni‐rich layered materials and LiCoO2. This work presents a promising approach for direct recycling of highly degraded cathode materials.

A novel 3D printing method enables the fabrication of materials with precisely controlled mechanical properties at nanoscale resolution. A volume‐conserving photoresist combined with the free and open‐source software, OpenScribe, achieves mechanical transitions over 770 nanometers ‐ representing a 130‐fold improvement over existing approaches. This advancement enables the creation of complex materials with unprecedented control over local elasticity.








Abstract
Fabrication methods that synthesize materials with higher precision and complexity at ever smaller scales are rapidly developing. Despite such advances, generating complex 3D materials with controlled mechanical properties at the nanoscale remains challenging. Exerting precise control over mechanical properties at the nanoscale would enable material strengths near theoretical maxima, and the replication of natural structures with hitherto unattainable strength‐to‐weight ratios. Here, a method for fabricating materials with nanovoxelated elastic moduli by employing a volume‐conserving photoresist composed of a copolymer hydrogel, along with OpenScribe, an open‐source software that enables the precise programming of material mechanics, is presented. Combining these, a material composed of periodic unit cells featuring heteromechanically tessellated soft‐stiff structures, achieving a mechanical transition over an order‐of‐magnitude change in elastic modulus within 770 nm, a 130‐fold improvement on previous reports, is demonstrated. This work critically advances material design and opens new avenues for fabricating materials with specifically tailored properties and functionalities through unparalleled control over nanoscale mechanics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel non‐fullerene acceptor, BFDO‐4F, is integrated into organic photodetectors (OPDs) to enable electron trapping. The resulting devices exhibit dual‐mode functionality, with bias‐switchable operation between photovoltaic (PV) and photomultiplication (PM) modes. An on‐chip module is demonstrated, where the PV section supplies bias for the PM section achieving self‐powered amplifier‐free system, highlighting the potential for multifunctional OPDs in advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photomultiplication‐type organic photodetectors (PM‐OPDs) provide for signal amplification, ideal for detecting faint light, and simplifying detection systems. However, current designs often suffer from slow response speed and elevated dark current. Conversely, photovoltaic‐type organic photodetectors (PV‐OPDs) provide fast response and high specific detectivity (D*) but have limited photoresponse. This study presents the synthesis and incorporation of a non‐fullerene acceptor, BFDO‐4F, into the active layer to introduce trap states for capturing photogenerated electrons. The resulting device exhibits dual‐mode characteristic and is bias‐switchable between PV and PM‐modes. In PV‐mode, the OPDs achieve high D* of 1.92 × 10¹2 Jones and a response time of 2.83/4.43 µs. In PM‐mode, the OPDs exhibit exceptional external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 3484% and a D* of up to 1.13 × 10¹2 Jones. An on‐chip self‐powered module with PV‐mode pixels driving a PM‐mode pixel is demonstrated, yielding a photocurrent approximately five times higher than the reference device. This approach paves the way for developing multifunctional bias‐switchable dual‐mode on‐chip OPDs, suitable for various applications.

<title>Machine Learning Relationships Between Nanoporous Structures and Electrochemical Performance in MOF Supercapacitors</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study constructs a unified supercapacitor database comprising hundreds of MOF electrodes based on constant‐potential molecular simulation. The relationships between porous structures and electrochemical performance are thoroughly examined through interpretable machine learning techniques, with molecular insights by analyzing in‐pore electrode‐ion coordination and ion diffusion. These findings pave the way for the design and optimization of advanced electrode materials.









Abstract
The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, constant‐potential molecular simulation is used to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal–organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well‐trained decision‐tree‐based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode‐ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D‐pore and 3D‐pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D‐pore and 3D‐pore MOFs. Especially for 3D‐pore MOFs, an exponential increase in porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in‐pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing. These findings provide profound insights for the design of high‐performance supercapacitor electrodes.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a breakthrough in wave manipulation physics and technology, enabling perfect absorption and precise wavefront control. The proposed concept of metagrating surpasses the size and efficiency limitations of conventional ones. Its compact, lightweight design tackles the key challenge inherent to all elastic wave‐manipulation metastructures, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their implementation in real‐world applications.








Abstract
Optical and acoustic metagratings have addressed the challenges of low‐efficiency wave manipulation and high‐complexity fabrication associated with metamaterials and metasurfaces. In this research, the concept of locally resonant elastic metagrating (LREM) is both theoretically and experimentally demonstrated, which is underpinned by the unique elastic impedance modulation and the hybridization of intrinsic evanescent waves. Remarkably, the LREM overcomes the size limitations of conventional metagratings and offers a distinctive design paradigm for highly efficient, compact, and lightweight structures for wave manipulation in elastic wave systems. Importantly, the LREM tackles a key challenge inherent to all elastic wave‐manipulation metastructures, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their real‐world applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, a highly scalable chemical approach based on the anion exchange reaction is developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite‐type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion.








Abstract
Li intrusion is the primary factor contributing to the undesirable cycling durability and rate capability of all‐solid‐state lithium metal batteries. However, conventional engineering methodologies for solid electrolytes (SEs) that focus on crystalline scales, such as doping, have limited efficacy in addressing this issue, as they not only involve cumbersome trial‐and‐error processes but also struggle to simultaneously optimize the multiple macroscopic properties necessary for effectively suppressing Li intrusion. Herein, rather than following the conventional practice of SE engineering, it is concentrated on optimizing SEs at the grain‐aggregate level. A highly scalable chemical approach based on a thermodynamic‐favored anion exchange reaction is first developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite‐type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion. The localized grain‐engineered electrolyte aggregates greatly enhance Li reversibility and are able to suppress Li intrusion under practical working conditions. Notably, the 20 µm‐Li||LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cell using localized grain‐engineered electrolyte aggregates can stably cycle for over 2000 cycles at a high current density of 1.6 mA cm−2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel vapor phase method is first proposed to reconstruct a robust LiF coating layer on the Li‐rich Mn‐based oxide cathodes. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF‐rich cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes on the electrode surface, contributing to a stable electrode‐electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode‐electrolyte interphase (CEI) is crucial to enhance the battery performance of Li‐rich Mn‐based oxide (LMO) cathodes. To achieve an ideal CEI, a gas‐phase fluorination technique is proposed to pre‐structure a robust LiF layer (≈1 nm) on the LMO surface. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface and mitigates undesirable side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF‐rich CEI layer on the LMO‐F‐1. The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes across the electrode surface and enhances Li+ diffusion in the electrode during (de)intercalation, contributing to a stable electrode‐electrolyte interface. Moreover, the robust LiF‐rich CEI layer effectively suppresses the decomposition of lithium salts in the electrolyte and reduces autocatalytic side reactions triggered by the by‐products. In addition, it improves the structural stability of LMO by increasing the formation energies of oxygen and manganese vacancies. As a result, the modified LMO with the LiF‐rich CEI retains 95% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical stability. The proposed gas‐phase Li+ flux homogenization strategy offers a promising avenue for enhancing the interface stability of high‐voltage cathode materials with lithium storage.

<title>Gasotransmitter‐Nanodonor for Spatial Regulation of Anxiety‐Like Behavior and Bone Metastasis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The gasotransmitter‐nanodonor FSG@AB co‐releases hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) and glucose oxidase (GOx) at bone metastases, disrupting mitochondrial function and inhibiting glycolysis to deplete tumor energy sources, exerting robust anti‐tumor effects. The released H₂S travels to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), upregulating glutamate transporter 1 (GLT‐1) expression, reducing extracellular glutamate levels, and mitigating glutamatergic hyperactivity, ultimately alleviating anxiety‐like behaviors.








Abstract
Anxiety is highly prevalent among cancer patients, significantly impacting their prognosis. Current cancer therapies typically lack anxiolytic properties and may even exacerbate anxiety. Here, a gasotransmitter‐nanodonors (GND) system is presented that exerts dual anxiolytic and anti‐tumor effects via a “tumor‐brain axis” strategy. The GND, synthesized by co‐embedding Fe2⁺ and S2⁻ ions along with glucose oxidase (GOx) within bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (FSG@AB), enables the controlled release of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) in the acidic tumor microenvironment. H₂S and GOx synergistically deplete tumor energy sources, resulting in robust anti‐tumor effects. Meanwhile, H₂S generated at the tumor site is transported through the bloodstream to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the brain, where it modulates neuronal activity. Specifically, in the ACC, H₂S upregulates glutamate transporter 1 (GLT‐1), which reduces extracellular glutamate levels and attenuates the hyperactivity of glutamatergic neurons, thereby alleviating anxiety‐like behavior. This study proposes a GND system that targets both oncological and psychiatric dimensions of cancer through the “tumor‐brain axis” strategy, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes.

The miniaturized and portable bio‐battery, fabricated by 3‐D printing of living hydrogels containing electroactive Shewanella oneidensis MR‐1 biofilms, represents a novel class of engineered living energy materials. The electricity generated by this device can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals.








Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio‐batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio‐battery orchestrating off‐the‐shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio‐battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3‐D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20 mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio‐battery with self‐charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio‐battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio‐energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

Research on the flexible bio‐inspired cognitive systems, classified into near‐ and in‐sensor computing, is addressed. Fundamental aspects, including biological processes, required components, and the device types for each component, as well as applications for wearable systems, are discussed. Additionally, perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics are provided.








Abstract
Flexible neuromorphic architectures that emulate biological cognitive systems hold great promise for smart wearable electronics. To realize neuro‐inspired sensing and computing electronics, artificial sensory neurons that detect and process external stimuli must be integrated with central nervous systems capable of parallel computation. In near‐sensor computing, synaptic devices, and sensors are used to emulate sensory neurons and receptors, respectively. In contrast, in in‐sensor computing, a single multifunctional device serves as both the receptor and neuron. Bio‐inspired cognitive systems efficiently detect and process stimuli through data structuring techniques, significantly reducing data volume and enabling the extension of neuromorphic applications to smart wearable systems. To construct wearable near‐ and in‐sensor computing, it is crucial to develop artificial sensory neurons and central nervous synapses that replicate the biological functionalities. Additionally, the integrated systems must exhibit high mechanical flexibility and integration density. This review addresses research on flexible bio‐inspired cognitive systems, classified into near‐ and in‐sensor computing. It covers fundamental aspects, including biological cognitive processes, the required components, and the structures for each component, as well as applications for wearable smart systems. Finally, it offers perspectives on future research directions for flexible neuromorphic electronics in smart wearable systems connected to the next‐generation Internet of Things.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review provides a comprehensive overview of deactivation mechanisms and regeneration strategies for single‐atom catalysts (SACs), identifying five deactivation pathways across seven destabilization scenarios and detailing three key regeneration strategies. It introduces advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques relevant to these processes. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing stable and efficient SACs for energy applications.








Abstract
Numerous in situ characterization studies have focused on revealing the catalytic mechanisms of single‐atom catalysts (SACs), providing a theoretical basis for their rational design. Although research is relatively limited, the stability of SACs under long‐term operating conditions is equally important and a prerequisite for their real‐world energy applications, such as fuel cells and water electrolyzers. Recently, there has been a rise in in situ characterization studies on the destabilization and regeneration of SACs; however, timely and comprehensive summaries that provide the catalysis community with valuable insights and research directions are still lacking. This review summarizes recent advances in the destabilization mechanisms and regeneration strategies of SACs, specifically highlighting various state‐of‐the‐art characterization techniques employed in the studies. The factors that induce destabilization in SACs are identified by discussing the failure of active sites, coordination environments, supports, and reaction conditions under long‐term operating scenarios. Next, the primary regeneration strategies for SACs are introduced, including redispersion, surface poison desorption, and exposure of subsurface active sites. Additionally, the advantages and limitations of both in situ and ex situ characterization techniques are discussed. Finally, future research directions are proposed, aimed at constructing structure–stability relationships and guiding the design of more stable SACs.

Metal complexes are widely used in biomedical research due to their excellent properties. To further overcome the pharmacological limitations of metal complexes, the multifunctional nanomaterials are developed. This review introduces the self‐assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles of various shapes, the mechanism of self‐assembly, and their applications in biomedical fields such as detection, imaging, and antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Cisplatin is widely used in clinical cancer treatment; however, its application is often hindered by severe side effects, particularly inherent or acquired resistance of target cells. To address these challenges, an effective strategy is to modify the metal core of the complex and introduce alternative coordination modes or valence states, leading to the development of a series of metal complexes, such as platinum (IV) prodrugs and cyclometalated complexes. Recent advances in nanotechnology have facilitated the development of multifunctional nanomaterials that can selectively deliver drugs to tumor cells, thereby overcoming the pharmacological limitations of metal‐based drugs. This review first explores the self‐assembly of metal complexes into spherical, linear, and irregular nanoparticles in the context of biomedical applications. The mechanisms underlying the self‐assembly of metal complexes into nanoparticles are subsequently analyzed, followed by a discussion of their applications in biomedical fields, including detection, imaging, and antitumor research.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts via the oxide path mechanism (OPM) is systematically reviewed. It sheds light on the rational design of OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts to break the activity‐stability trade‐offs involved in conventional OER mechanisms, leading to more efficient energy conversion and storage processes, such as water electrolysis, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal‐air batteries.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone of various electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems, including water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and rechargeable metal‐air batteries. OER typically proceeds through three primary mechanisms: adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), and oxide path mechanism (OPM). Unlike AEM and LOM, the OPM proceeds via direct oxygen–oxygen radical coupling that can bypass linear scaling relationships of reaction intermediates in AEM and avoid catalyst structural collapse in LOM, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity and stability. Despite its unique advantage, electrocatalysts that can drive OER via OPM remain nascent and are increasingly recognized as critical. This review discusses recent advances in OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts. It starts by analyzing three reaction mechanisms that guide the design of electrocatalysts. Then, several types of novel materials, including atomic ensembles, metal oxides, perovskite oxides, and molecular complexes, are highlighted. Afterward, operando characterization techniques used to monitor the dynamic evolution of active sites and reaction intermediates are examined. The review concludes by discussing several research directions to advance OPM‐based OER electrocatalysts toward practical applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Inspired by the thermal adaptability of army ant nest, an innovative textile, Army ant Nest Textile (ANT), is developed for intelligent thermal regulation and healthcare monitoring. The ANT swiftly reacts to perspiration, enhancing heat dissipation through improved radiation transmission and air exchange. Additionally, it integrates colorimetric sensors for temperature, sweat pH, and UV intensity, providing vital risk signals for users.








Abstract
A textile material that can dynamically adapt to different environments while serving as an immediate alert system for early detection of life‐threatening factors in the surroundings, not only enhances the individual's health management but also contributes to a reduction in energy consumption for space cooling and/or heating. In nature, different species have their own adaptation system to ambient temperature. Inspired by the army ant nest, herein a thermal adaptive textile known as Army ant Nest Textile (ANT) for thermal management and health monitoring is reported. This textile can promptly respond to perspiration, rapidly absorb sweat, and then transform its architecture to facilitate heat dissipation. Simultaneously, the colorimetric sensing function of ANT allows it to emulate the “site migration” behavior of the army ant nest, which empowers individuals to expeditiously identify multiple health‐related signals such as body temperature, UV radiation, and sweat pH values, and warn them to move to a secure environment, thereby effectively reducing the likelihood of physical harm. Together with its excellent scalability and biocompatibility, the ANT offers a promising direction for the development of next‐generation smart e‐textiles for personal thermal and healthcare management, while satisfying the growing demand for energy saving.

A controllable “oxygen vehicle” as a versatile nano‐carrier. For co‐delivery with lactate oxidase (LOX) significantly elevated lactate detection rates, triggering a significantly increase in IFN‐γ and T cell infiltration. Co‐delivering unmethylated cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine oligonucleotide （CpGODN） demonstrate a remarkable increase in polarization of macrophages from M2‐like to M1‐like phenotypes, DCs maturation, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia severely limits the antitumor immunotherapy for breast cancer. Although efforts to alleviate tumor hypoxia and drug delivery using diverse nanostructures achieve promising results, the creation of a versatile controllable oxygen‐releasing nano‐platform for co‐delivery with immunostimulatory molecules remains a persistent challenge. To address this problem, a versatile oxygen controllable releasing vehicle PFOB@F127@PDA (PFPNPs) is developed, which effectively co‐delivered either protein drug lactate oxidase (LOX) or nucleic acids drug unmethylated cytosine‐phosphate‐guanine oligonucleotide (CpG ODNs). Upon photothermal heating, this platform triggered oxygen release, thereby augmenting LOX‐mediated lactate detection rates, and improving T cells infiltrating and cytokine expression. Moreover, under an oxygenated tumor microenvironment (TME), PFPNPs co‐delivered with CpG ODNs effectively reprogrammed the immunosuppressive TME by repolarizing macrophages to an M1‐like phenotype, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and increasing tumor‐infiltrating T cells while decreasing the ratio of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Our study demonstrated that this controlled oxygen‐releasing platform possessed adaptive drug‐loading capabilities to meet varied immunotherapeutic demands in clinical settings.

<title>Microenvironment Mechanical Torque from ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) Micromotors Inhibiting Tumor Migration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles self‐assemble in situ effectively and introduce mechanical force simulating primary biomechanical into the tiny target spot of TME through wireless magnetic control, which effectively inhibits tumor migration.








Abstract
Mechanical force attracts booming attention with the potential to tune the tumor cell behavior, especially in cell migration. However, the current approach for introducing mechanical input is difficult to apply in vivo. How the mechanical force affects cell behavior in situ also remains unclear. In this work, an intelligent miniaturized platform is constructed with magnetic ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) micromotors. The wireless ZFO can self‐assemble in situ and rotate to generate mechanical torque of biologically relevant piconewton‐scale at the target tumor site. It is observed unexpectedly that enhanced in situ mechanical rotating torque from ZFO micromotors and the active fluid inhibit the migration of highly invasive A549 tumor cells. The down‐regulation of the Piezo1 channel and the suppressed signaling of ROCK1 in mechano‐adaptive tumor cells is found to be related to the inhibition effect. With effectiveness confirmed with the zebrafish xenograft model, this platform provides a valuable toolkit for mechanobiology and force‐associated non‐invasive tumor therapy.

It is envisioned that metamaterials can actively, precisely, and rapidly reprogram their performances through digital interfaces toward varying demands. However, on‐demand reprogramming by integration of physical and digital merits still remains less explored. Here, a real‐time reprogrammable mechanical metamaterial is reported that is guided by its own structure‐performance relations. The metamaterial consists of periodically tessellated bistable building blocks with built‐in soft actuators for state switching, exhibiting rich spatial heterogeneity. Guided by the pre‐established relations between state sequences and stress–strain curves, the metamaterial can accurately match a target curve by digitally tuning its state within 4 s. The metamaterial can be elastically tensioned and compressed under a strain of 4%, and its modulus tuning ratio reaches >30. Moreover, it also shows highly tunable shearing and bending performances. This work provides a new thought for the physical performance reprogrammability of artificial intelligent systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Through‐sapphire machining is integrated with superconducting quantum processors (QPUs) and qubits. High coherence of the qubits is demonstrated as well as low parameter spread. This machining integration provides a route to further scaling of QPUs on new materials such as tantalum that are typically deposited on sapphire substrates. In addition, the machining provides a route to through‐sapphire‐vias in superconducting circuits.








Abstract
A sapphire machining process integrated with intermediate‐scale quantum processors is demonstrated. The process allows through‐substrate electrical connections, necessary for low‐frequency mode‐mitigation, as well as signal‐routing, which are vital as quantum computers scale in qubit number, and thus dimension. High‐coherence qubits are required to build fault‐tolerant quantum computers and so material choices are an important consideration when developing a qubit technology platform. Sapphire, as a low‐loss dielectric substrate, has shown to support high‐coherence qubits. In addition, recent advances in material choices such as tantalum and titanium‐nitride, both deposited on a sapphire substrate, have demonstrated qubit lifetimes exceeding 0.3 ms. However, the lack of any process equivalent of deep‐silicon etching to create through‐substrate‐vias in sapphire, or to inductively shunt large dies, has limited sapphire to small‐scale processors, or necessitates the use of chiplet architecture. Here, a sapphire machining process that is compatible with high‐coherence qubits is presented. This technique immediately provides a means to scale quantum processing units (QPUs) with integrated mode‐mitigation, and provides a route toward the development of through‐sapphire‐vias, both of which allow the advantages of sapphire to be leveraged as well as facilitating the use of sapphire‐compatible materials for large‐scale QPUs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Green and red quantum dot (QD) luminescence microspheres with simultaneous excellent color conversion performance and high photoluminescence stability are synthesized by a facile wet chemical process. They further serve as color conversion materials for the fabrication of green and red micro‐LEDs, which exhibit world‐record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1% and high brightnesses of 1.7 × 108 and 7.6 × 107 cd m−2.








Abstract
Quantum dot (QD)‐converted micrometer‐scale light‐emitting diodes (micro‐LEDs) are regarded as an effective solution for achieving high‐performance full‐color micro‐LED displays because of their narrow‐band emission, simplified mass transfer, facile drive circuits, and low cost. However, these micro‐LEDs suffer from significant blue light leakage and unsatisfactory electroluminescence properties due to the poor light conversion efficiency and stability of the QDs. Herein, the construction of green and red QD luminescence microspheres with the simultaneously high conversion efficiency of blue light and strong photoluminescence stability are proposed. These luminescence microspheres exhibit high external photoluminescence quantum yields exceeding 46% under 450 nm excitation, along with excellent reliability against blue light, heat, and water‐oxygen degradation, owing to the waveguide and spatial confinement effects of the microspheres. The microsphere‐based green and red micro‐LEDs achieve world‐record external quantum efficiencies of 40.8% and 22.1%, respectively, and high brightness values of 1.7 × 108 and 7.6 × 107 cd m−2, respectively. Finally, 0.6 inch red, green, and blue monochrome micro‐LED displays are demonstrated by integrating microsphere‐converted micro‐LED arrays with thin‐film transistor backplanes, which show a pixel resolution as high as 1700 PPI and brightness exceeding 10 000 cd m−2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By inducing LiOTf in SnO2/ PbI2, the defects in bulk SnO2 and at the interface are passivated and stress in PbI2 is released, thus reducing the critical Gibbs free energy for mesoporous PbI2 films which leads to highly crystalline perovskite films. Ultimately, efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a champion PCE of 25.33% are fabricated.








Abstract
Porous lead iodide (PbI2) film is crucial for the complete reaction between PbI2 and ammonium salts in sequential‐deposition technology so as to achieve high crystallinity perovskite film. Herein, it is found that the tensile stress in tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) is a key factor influencing the morphology and crystallization of PbI2 films. Focusing on this, lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiOTf) is used as an interfacial modifier in the SnO2/PbI2 interface to decrease the tensile stress to reduce the necessary critical Gibbs free energy for PbI2 nuclei formation. The relaxed tensile stress facilitates the more porous PbI2 generation with larger particles and higher roughness, resulting in superior‐quality perovskite films. Besides, this strategy effectively passivates the inherent electron traps of SnO2 and smooths the interfacial energy levels, boosting the charge extraction and transfer. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.33% (25.10% stabilized for 600 s) is achieved. Furthermore, the device demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining 90% of its initial PCE at its maximum power point tracking measurement (under 100 mW cm−2 white light illumination at ≈55 °C temperature, in N2 atmosphere) after 600 h.

<title>A Universal Therapeutic Vaccine Leveraging Autologous Pre‐Existing Immunity to Eliminate in Situ Uniformly Engineered Heterogeneous Tumor Cells</title>

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202412430?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The therapeutic vaccine overcomes immune evasion and resistance in diverse tumor cells by utilizing the highly immunogenic SARS‐CoV‐2 RBD antigen, enhancing antigen presentation via SUSD6 shRNA, and silencing the immune checkpoint gene PD‐L1 through shRNA. It further amplifies RBD‐specific pre‐existing immunity with adjuvant‐supported secretion of RBD‐enveloped virus‐like particles, achieving precise and effective eradication of engineered tumor cells.








Abstract
Tumor vaccines that activate the autologous immune system to eliminate tumor cells represent a promising approach in cancer immunotherapy. However, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, limited antigen selection, insufficient antigen presentation, and the slow onset of de novo immune responses have resulted in poor universality and suboptimal response rates. In contrast, pathogen‐specific pre‐existing immunity acquired through infection or vaccination, can rapidly generate a more potent and enduring immune response upon re‐encounter with the same antigen. Here, an adeno‐associated virus (AAV)‐based therapeutic vaccine capable of genetically modifying diverse tumor cells to uniformly overexpress and efficiently present the highly immunogenic transmembrane SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and to release RBD‐enveloped virus‐like particles, which awaken and enhance the RBD‐specific pre‐existing immunity, leading to significant tumor remission, is engineered. Mechanistically, this therapeutic vaccine leverages the robust RBD‐specific pre‐existing immunity and heightened antibody‐mediated phagocytosis to eliminate engineered tumor cells while inducing antigen spreading, thereby provoking a more diverse tumor‐specific cellular immune responses. Notably, widespread administration of vaccines against various pathogens has provided a versatile pool of pre‐existing immunity that can be redirected to eradicate tumors. These findings offer a novel perspective on overcoming the limitations posed by tumor heterogeneity and personalized medicine.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Based on a unique metal‐organic core–shell coordination structure, new supercooled liquid materials successfully achieve mutually phase‐stability and controllable phase‐transition in inherent contradictory, for practical long‐term thermal energy storage.








Abstract
Mutual acquisition of phase‐stability and controllable phase‐transition becomes a predominant criterion of phase‐change materials for the practical long‐term energy storage but seems contradictory always. Here a strategy combining coordination and hydrogen bonds hierarchically to create a supercooled liquid in a core–shell coordination structure is reported, addressing that demand successfully. This new material is composed of a Mn‐methylurea complex (MM) core and the hierarchically bonded erythritols shell. MM glass core with a viscosity of 108 Pa·s determines its thermal phase‐stability. As discovered, the ingenious ligand‐exchange between erythritol and Cl− ion coordinated with MM core accounts for this effectively reversible phase‐transition. This can be triggered by a small shear‐stress of 10 Pa within tens of seconds, exhibiting good practicability. Thermodynamics and kinetics of phase‐transition are explored.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents a systematic method for the direct growth of GaN on six‐inch silicon substrates without buffers, significantly reducing GaN‐to‐substrate thermal resistance while maintaining structural quality comparable to buffered approaches. As‐grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this buffer‐less platform demonstrate state‐of‐the‐art 2D electron gas mobilities, paving the way for efficient III‐nitride transistors and advancing fundamental research on electron dynamics.








Abstract
Thick metamorphic buffers are considered indispensable for III‐V semiconductor heteroepitaxy on large lattice and thermal‐expansion mismatched silicon substrates. However, III‐nitride buffers in conventional GaN‐on‐Si high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) impose a substantial thermal resistance, deteriorating device efficiency and lifetime by throttling heat extraction. To circumvent this, a systematic methodology for the direct growth of GaN after the AlN nucleation layer on six‐inch silicon substrates is demonstrated using metal‐organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Crucial growth‐stress modulation to prevent epilayer cracking is achieved even without buffers, and threading dislocation densities comparable to those in buffered structures are realized. The buffer‐less design yields a GaN‐to‐substrate thermal resistance of (11 ± 4) m2 K GW−1, an order of magnitude reduction over conventional GaN‐on‐Si and one of the lowest on any non‐native substrate. As‐grown AlGaN/AlN/GaN heterojunctions on this template show a high‐quality 2D electron gas (2DEG) whose room‐temperature Hall‐effect mobility exceeds 2000 cm2 V−1 s−1, rivaling the best‐reported values. As further validation, the low‐temperature magnetoresistance of this 2DEG shows clear Shubnikov‐de‐Haas oscillations, a quantum lifetime > 0.180 ps, and tell‐tale signatures of spin‐splitting. These results could establish a new platform for III‐nitrides, potentially enhancing the energy efficiency of power transistors and enabling fundamental investigations into electron dynamics in quasi‐2D wide‐bandgap systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Insufficient hole injection, excessive electron injection, and abundant defects on the surface of QDs are limiting the performance of blue QLEDs. An in situ patching strategy with GACl is proposed to simultaneously passivate surface defects and enhance hole injection, with the EQE increasing from 16.3% to 23.5%. The model is proposed to understand the physical mechanism of hole injection and transport.








Abstract
The poor efficiency and stability of blue Quantum Dot Light‐Emitting diodes (QLED) hinders the practical applications of QLEDs full‐color displays. Excessive electron injection, insufficient hole injection, and abundant defects on the surface of quantum dots (QD) are the main issues limiting the performance of blue devices. Herein, an in situ treatment with bipolar small molecule polydentate ligand–guanidine chloride (GACl) is proposed to simultaneously suppress excessive electron injection, patch surface defects of QDs and enhance hole injection. GACl‐treated blue QLEDs exhibited a remarkable increase in maximal external quantum Efficiency (EQE) from 16.3% to a record 23.5%, accompanied by maximal luminance (36810 cd m−2), excellent maximal current efficiency (17.5 cd A−1), and enhanced device stability. Combining C–V and J–V characteristics, a concise physical model of hole injection is also established: Below 3 V, hole injection is controlled by the interfacial barrier, primarily through tunneling and thermionic injection; Above 3 V, the interfacial barrier is eliminated, and hole injection efficiency is governed by transport within the QD layer. This study showed a clear physical model for understanding the hole injection mechanism in QLEDs, offering valuable design strategies for improving the performance of blue‐QLEDs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Lattice‐confined Pt1/Ni(OH)2 SACs with excellent activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are constructed by a co‐reduction strategy. Mechanism studies disclose the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step during HER. Finally, this facile synthesis approach is extended to fabricate other 9 lattice‐confined SACs.








Abstract
The confining effect is essential to regulate the activity and stability of single‐atom catalysts (SACs), but the universal fabrication of confined SACs is still a great challenge. Here, various lattice‐confined Pt SACs supported by different carriers are constructed by a universal co‐reduction approach. Notably, Pt single atoms confined in the lattice of Ni(OH)2 (Pt1/Ni(OH)2) with a high electron‐deficient state exhibit excellent activity for basic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 just requires 15 mV to get 10 mA cm−2 and the mass activity of Pt1/Ni(OH)2 is 15 times of commercial Pt/C. Moreover, Pt1/Ni(OH)2 assembled in an alkaline water electrolyzer shows 1030 h durability under the industrial current density of 800 mA cm−2. In situ spectroscopy techniques reveal Pt─H and “free” OH radical can be directly observed for Pt1/Ni(OH)2, confirming the lattice‐confined Pt single atoms play a key role during HER. Further density functional theory uncovers the Pt 3d orbital strongly hybridizes with O 2p and Ni 3d orbitals in Ni(OH)2, which quickly optimizes the electronic state of the Pt site, thus largely reducing the energy barrier of the rate‐determining step to 0.16 eV for HER. Finally, this synthesis method is extended to construct other 9 lattice‐confined SACs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In this work, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries are determined for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 epitaxial thin films, via measurements of conventional anti‐damping torques in the high‐symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. Rotational transformations of this tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional torques for IrO2 in the lower‐symmetry orientations, with good agreement.








Abstract
Unconventional spin‐orbit torques arising from electric‐field‐generated spin currents in anisotropic materials have promising potential for spintronic applications, including for perpendicular magnetic switching in high‐density memory applications. Here, all the independent elements of the spin torque conductivity tensor allowed by bulk crystal symmetries for the tetragonal conductor IrO2 are determined via measurements of conventional (in‐plane) anti‐damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the high‐symmetry (001) and (100) orientations. It is then tested whether rotational transformations of this same tensor can predict both the conventional and unconventional anti‐damping torques for IrO2 thin films in the lower‐symmetry (101), (110), and (111) orientations, finding good agreement. The results confirm that spin‐orbit torques from all these orientations are consistent with the bulk symmetries of IrO2, and show how simple measurements of conventional torques from high‐symmetry orientations of anisotropic thin films can provide an accurate prediction of the unconventional torques from lower‐symmetry orientations.

Inspired by the Namib Pachydactylus Rangei, a Power‐Free Cooling moisture harvester with Luneburg Lens Array is fabricated using Self‐Developed μ‐ECM process. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with Exceptional Passive sub‐Dewpoint Cooling and Efficient Harvesting Performance. Installing every 1 m2 of PFCMH can Yield ≈294.5–490.6 kg per year of water and Save ≈198.7–331.0 kWh per year of electricity.








Abstract
The development of zero‐power moisture‐harvesting technology in an unsaturated atmosphere is of great significance for coping with global freshwater scarcity. Here, inspired by Pachydactylus rangei's (Namib sand gecko) ability to evade thermal radiation and harvest moisture, a power‐free cooling moisture harvester (PFCMH) is fabricated using the continuous, industrialized micro‐extrusion compression molding. A Luneburg lens is introduced in the PFCMH for the first time, endowing it with a high reflectivity of ≈92.9% in 0.3 to the 2.5 µm waveband and emissivity of ≈98.1% in 8–13 µm waveband, which are ≈19.2% and ≈15.4% higher than those of the unstructured radiative cooler, respectively. Consequently, a temperature reduction of ≈6.9 °C is achieved. In addition, the wettability of PFCMH is well regulated, at a contact angle of ≈153° and a rolling angle of ≈42°, enabling its surface to efficiently nucleate and transport water droplets. The synergy between the surface and interface functions endows the PFCMH with exceptional passive sub‐dewpoint cooling and efficient harvesting performance. Importantly, every 1 m2 of PFCMH can yield ≈294.5–490.6 kg year−1 of water and save ≈198.7–331.0 kWh year−1 of electricity. The PFCMH offers an environmentally, power‐free, and promising solution to freshwater scarcity.

Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. This work reported a quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium‐based metal–organic frameworks (GaMOF), to capture the Methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a “captor” and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me). Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel (Me/QCSGa‐MOF@Cryogel) is fabricated for combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.








Abstract
Antimicrobial resistance and impaired bone regeneration are the great challenges in treating infected bone defects. Its recurrent and resistant nature, high incidence rate, long‐term hospitalization, and high medical costs have driven the efforts of the scientific community to develop new therapies to improve the situation. Considering the complex microenvironment and persistent mechanisms mediated by resistant bacteria, it is crucial to develop an implant with enhanced osseointegration and sustained and effective infection clearance effects. Here, a positively charged quaternized chitosan (QCS) coated gallium‐based metal–organic framework (GaMOF) is designed, to capture the antibiotic‐resistant bacteria (Methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA) as a “captor”, and rejuvenate Methicillin (Me) via disturbing the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Then, a radially oriented porous cryogel loaded with the Me and QCSGaMOF is fabricated by the directional freeze‐casting method. The oriented porous structure has an enhanced osseointegration effect by guiding the ingrowth of osteogenic cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments prove the advantages of as‐prepared Me/QCSGa‐MOF@Cryogel in combating resistant bacteria and guiding bone regeneration in infected bone defects.

This article presents the design and characterization of first molecular ferroelectric Mott insulator, (C7H14N)3V12O30. Accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 shows a sharp change in conductivity, implying the metal–insulator transition‐like behavior. This finding opened up new possibilities for the development of strongly correlated electron systems.








Abstract
With the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance materials and high‐temperature superconductors, Mott insulators can potentially undergo a transition from insulating state to metallic state. Here, in molecular ferroelectrics system, a Mott insulator of (C7H14N)3V12O30 has been first synthesized, which is a 2D organic–inorganic ferroelectric with composition of layered vanadium oxide and quinuclidine ring. Interestingly, accompanied by the ferroelectric phase transition, (C7H14N)3V12O30 changes sharply in conductivity. The occurrence of a Mott transition has been proven by electric transport measurements and theoretical calculations. This research has significantly expanded the applicative horizons of ferroelectric materials, and offering an ideal platform for the investigation of strongly correlated electron systems.

The optical properties of antimony make it a promising candidate for photonic memory applications due to the large contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states. This study resolves the entire switching cycle from crystal to glass and back. It elucidates the structural origin of the optical properties of the final and intermediate transient states, which are relevant for high bandwidth photonic applications.








Abstract
As a phase change material (PCM), antimony exhibits a set of desirable properties that make it an interesting candidate for photonic memory applications. These include a large optical contrast between crystalline and amorphous solid states over a wide wavelength range. Switching between the states is possible on nanosecond timescales by applying short heating pulses. The glass state is reached through melting and rapid quenching through a supercooled liquid regime. While initial and final states are easily characterized, little is known about the optical properties on the path to forming a glass. Here we resolve the entire switching cycle of antimony with femtosecond resolution in stroboscopic optical pump‐probe measurements and combine the experimental results with ab‐initio molecular dynamics simulations. The glass formation process of antimony is revealed to be a complex multi‐step process, where the intermediate transient states exhibit distinct optical properties with even larger contrasts than those observed between crystal and glass. The provided quantitative understanding forms the basis for exploitation in high bandwidth photonic applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Liquid crystal elastomer films with dense nanowire arrays exhibit synergistic adhesion and shape‐changing properties. They curl toward the nanowire side under heat or chemical vapors but away from it with liquid droplets. Chemical modifications make them superoleophobic underwater, enabling precise droplet manipulation. This biomimetic design integrates enhanced adhesion with stimuli‐responsive deformation, with promising applications in soft robotics and adaptive surfaces.








Abstract
Nature provides many examples of the benefits of nanoscopic surface structures in areas of adhesion and antifouling. Herein, the design, fabrication, and characterization of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films are presented with nanowire surface structures that exhibit tunable stimuli‐responsive deformations and enhanced adhesion properties. The LCE films are shown to curl toward the side with the nanowires when stimulated by heat or organic solvent vapors. In contrast, when a droplet of the same solvent is placed on the film, it curls away from the nanowire side due to nanowire‐induced capillary forces that cause unequal swelling. This characteristic curling deformation is shown to be reversible and can be optimized to match curved substrates, maximizing adhesive shear forces. By using chemical modification, the LCE nanowire films can be given underwater superoleophobicity, enabling oil repellency under a range of harsh conditions. This is combined with the nanowire‐induced frictional asymmetry and the reversible shape deformation to create an underwater droplet mixing robot, capable of performing chemical reactions in aqueous environments. These findings demonstrate the potential of nanowire‐augmented LCE films for advanced applications in soft robotics, adaptive adhesion, and easy chemical modification, with implications for designing responsive materials that integrate mechanical flexibility with surface functionality.

Uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) that inherit the single atomic Fe–N4 center of hemin while creating sp2‐hybridized carbon surroundings were created by a simple solvothermal treatment of hemin. HNCDs synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I, thus can significantly induce tumor pyroptosis and evoke strong antitumor immune response even under hypoxic environment.









Abstract
General synthesis and mechanical understanding of type I nano‐photosensitizers are of great importance for hypoxia‐resistant pyroptosis inducers. Herein, a simple solvothermal treatment is developed to convert non‐photosensitive small molecules (hemin) into uniform carbon nanodots (HNCDs) with strong type I photodynamic activity and red fluorescence emission. These HNCDs inherit the single atomic Fe–N4 center of hemin while creating sp2‐hybridized carbon surroundings, which synergistically modulated the energy level and electron transfer for converting the type II photodynamic process to type I. After encapsulating HNCDs with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to facilitate in vivo applications, the resulting BSA nanoparticles (HB) can image tumors and significantly induce the pyroptosis of tumor cells even under an extremely hypoxic environment (2% O2). This evokes a strong antitumor immune response, effectively restraining tumor growth and lung metastasis in triple‐negative breast cancer mice, with good biocompatibility. This work introduces an applicable pyroptosis nano‐inducer to combat hypoxic tumors and highlights the regulation of Fe–N4 centers to develop hypoxia‐resistant type I nano‐photosensitizers for cancer treatment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electric field‐induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E‐induced NDD) ascribed to the diagonal electrotoroidic effect is discovered in a time‐reversal‐odd antiferromagnet Co₂SiO₄ possessing a time‐reversal‐odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Spatial distribution measurements of E‐induced NDD reveal domain structures. Magnetic field‐induced domain inversion mediated by the piezomagnetic effect highlights the rich physics of time‐reversal‐odd antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with broken time‐reversal (T$\mathcal{T}$) symmetry (T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd antiferromagnets) have gained extensive attention, mainly due to their ferromagnet‐like behavior despite the absence of net magnetization. However, certain types of T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd antiferromagnets remain inaccessible by the typical ferromagnet‐like phenomena (e.g., anomalous Hall effect). One such system is characterized by a T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd scalar quantity, the magnetic toroidal monopole. To access the broken T$\mathcal{T}$ symmetry in such a system, a unique nonreciprocal optical phenomenon, electric field‐induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism (E‐induced NDD), is employed. Signals of E‐induced NDD are successfully detected in a T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd antiferromagnet, Co₂SiO₄, whose magnetic structure is characterized by the magnetic toroidal monopole. Furthermore, by spatially resolving the E‐induced NDD, spatial distributions of a pair of domain states related to one another by the T$\mathcal{T}$ operation are visualized. The domain imaging revealed the inversion of the domain pattern by applying a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling attributed to the piezomagnetic effect. The observation of E‐induced NDD highlights unique functionalities of T$\mathcal{T}$‐odd antiferromagnets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
High‐modulus homochiral Al2O3 yarn artificial muscles with a different actuation mechanism containing volume expansion and topological structure transformation are fabricated. Under an electric drive, the torsional muscle provides a high actuation stress of 483.5 MPa, a large energy density of 9.8 J g−1, and a high output power of 10.3 W g−1, while maintaining a large stroke of 13.5%.








Abstract
Fiber‐based artificial muscles are soft actuators used to mimic the movement of human muscles. However, using high modulus oxide ceramics to fabricate artificial muscles with high energy and power is a challenge as they are prone to brittle fracture during torsion. Here, a ceramic metallization strategy is reported that solves the problem of low torsion and low ductility of alumina (Al2O3) ceramics by chemical plating a thin copper layer on alumina filaments. These filaments with a high modulus of ≈180 GPa can be twisted into chiral coiled artificial muscles, exhibiting a unique electric thermal actuation mechanism. This tough and robust alumina artificial muscle can carry objects equivalent to 0.28 million times its weight and provide high actuation stress of up to 483.5 MPa. In addition, it exhibits 18 times higher contraction power and 240 times higher energy density than human muscles, as well as a high energy conversion efficiency of up to 7.59%, which far exceeds most reported actuated carbon and polymer artificial muscles. This work has achieved large‐scale manufacturing of high‐modulus oxide ceramic muscles for the first time.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
To overcome the challenges of limited light penetration and insufficient oxygen supply in PDT for metastatic tumor treatment, a self‐contained organelle‐mimicking nanoreactor is engineered with DNA switches using cell‐inspired compartmentalization technology. It utilizes endogenous glucose as a biofuel, luminol as a light source, and hemoglobin as an oxygen supplier to achieve self‐illuminating chemiexcited PDT via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer.








Abstract
Metastasis, the leading cause of mortality in cancer patients, presents challenges for conventional photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its reliance on localized light and oxygen application to tumors. To overcome these limitations, a self‐sustained organelle‐mimicking nanoreactor is developed here with programmable DNA switches that enables bio‐chem‐photocatalytic cascade‐driven starvation‐photodynamic synergistic therapy against tumor metastasis. Emulating the compartmentalization and positional assembly strategies found in living cells, this nano‐organelle reactor allows quantitative co‐compartmentalization of multiple functional modules for the designed self‐illuminating chemiexcited PDT system. Within the space‐confined nanoreactor, biofuel glucose is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) which enhances luminol‐based chemiluminescence (CL), consequently driving the generation of photochemical singlet oxygen (1O2) via chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer. Meanwhile, hemoglobin functions as a synchronized oxygen supplier for both glucose oxidation and PDT, while also exhibiting peroxidase‐like activity to produce hydroxyl radicals (·OH). Crucially, the nanoreactor keeps switching off in normal tissues, with on‐demand activation in tumors through toehold‐mediated strand displacement. These findings demonstrate that this nanoreactor, which is self‐sufficient in light and oxygen and precise in striking tumors, presents a promising paradigm for managing highly metastatic cancers.

<title>Flat‐Band Electronic Bipolarity in a Janus and Kagome van der Waals Semiconductor Nb3TeI7</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A Janus and Kagome van der Waals material Nb3TeI7 exhibits strong electronic bipolar states and robust semiconducting properties with the face‐dependent n‐type and p‐type field‐effect transistor behaviors. Strong built‐in out‐of‐plane polarization is attributed to ferroelectric‐like stacking, amplified by strong electron correlation in the Nb flat bands at the breathing‐Kagome lattice, endowing Nb3TeI7 with a promising material platform for Janus‐material‐based applications.








Abstract
Janus materials, a novel class of materials with two faces of different chemical compositions and electronic polarities, offer significant potential for various applications with catalytic reactions, chemical sensing, and optical or electronic responses. A key aspect for such functionalities is face‐dependent electronic bipolarity, which is usually limited by the chemical distinction of terminated surfaces and has not been exploited in the semiconducting regime. Here, it is showed that a Janus and Kagome van der Waals (vdW) material Nb3TeI7 has ferroelectric‐like coherent stacking of the Janus layers and hosts strong electronic bipolar states in the semiconducting regime. A large potential difference of ∼ 0.7 eV between the I4 and TeI3 terminated surfaces is observed, despite only one fourth of the I atoms being replaced by Te atoms on one side of the layers. Additionally, robust semiconducting properties with the face‐dependent n‐type and p‐type field‐effect transistor behaviors are demonstrated. These unique properties are attributed to Nb 4d orbital flat bands of the breathing‐Kagome lattice, of which significantly large electron mass makes the semiconducting properties immune to impurity doping, and inherent strong electron correlation enhances asymmetric electron distribution, thereby amplifying a built‐in electric field. These findings highlight that naturally‐grown Janus and Kagome vdW semiconductors provide a promising material platform for utilizing strong electronic bipolarity in 2D‐material‐based applications.

<title>Spin‐Orbit‐Locking Vectorial Metasurface Holography</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a general multi‐channel vectorial holography technique encoded by both the spin and orbital angular momentum using a minimalist, non‐interleaved, geometry‐phase metasurface. The approach not only substantially enhances the selectivity of the input light, exhibiting spin‐orbit‐locking behavior, but also expands the multiplexing capacity of the output optical field, opening new avenues for advanced light manipulation.








Abstract
Vectorial metasurface holography, allowing for independent control over the amplitude, phase, and polarization distribution of holographic images enabled by metasurfaces, plays a crucial role in the realm of optical display, optical, and quantum communications. However, previous research on vectorial metasurface holography has typically been restricted to single degree of freedom input and single channel output, thereby demonstrating a very limited modulation capacity. This work presents a novel method to achieve multi‐channel vectorial metasurface holography by harnessing spin‐orbit‐locking vortex beams. In each channel, the optical vectorial field is encoded with a pair of total angular momentums (TAMs) featuring two orthogonal spin angular momentums (SAMs) independently locked with arbitrary orbital angular momentums (OAMs). The methodology relies on a modified Gerchberg‐Saxton algorithm, enabling the encoding of various TAM channels within a single phase profile. Consequently, a pure geometry‐phase metasurface with a non‐interleaved approach can be used to support such multi‐channel vectorial holography, achieving high selectivity of both SAM and OAM, and offering precise routing and manipulation of complex light channels. The work presents a paradigm shift in the field of holography, offering promising avenues for high‐density optical information processing and future photonic device design.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Partially ligand‐exchanged InP QDs with lipoic acid can undergo direct optical patterning when exposed to UV light, which induces disulfide ring opening, leading to polymerization and the assembly of the QDs. This approach also allows for the creation of stretchable QD films that can be recycled through reversible polymerization. This study provides a solution for future advanced displays and optoelectronics.








Abstract
The evolution of display technologies is rapidly transitioning from traditional screens to advanced augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) and wearable devices, where quantum dots (QDs) serve as crucial pure‐color emitters. While solution processing efficiently forms QD solids, challenges emerge in subsequent stages, such as layer deposition, etching, and solvent immersion. These issues become especially pronounced when developing diverse form factors, necessitating innovative patterning methods that are both reversible and sustainable. Herein, a novel approach utilizing lipoic acid (LA) as a ligand is presented, featuring a carboxylic acid group for QD surface attachment and a reversible disulfide ring structure. Upon i‐line UV exposure, the LA ligand initiates ring‐opening polymerization (ROP), crosslinking the QDs and enhances their solvent resistance. This method enables precise full‐color QD patterns with feature sizes as small as 3 µm and pixel densities exceeding 3788 ppi. Additionally, it supports the fabrication of stretchable QD composites using LA‐derived monomers. The reversible ROP process allows for flexibility, self‐healing, and QD recovery, promoting sustainability and expanding QD applications for ultra‐fine patterning and on‐silicon displays.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A mesoporous B‐doped carbon (meso‐BPC) with highly efficient curved B4C active sites for 2e− oxygen reduction reaction catalyst under a neutral electrolyte is reported. Combining experiments with dentity functional theory calculations, it is revealed that the mesoporous structure and B4C active site on the curved carbon surface significantly improve the oxygen supply and catalytic activity at high current densities and air‐supplied environments.









Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis via the 2e− oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost‐effective and safe alternative to the energy‐intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air‐fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H2O2 production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B‐doped carbons with novel curved B4C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using a pore‐former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e− ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B4C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e− ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B4C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150 mA cm−2 under air‐supplied conditions, along with an impressive O2 utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis in a practical environment.

Herein, this work demonstrates a radical technology that will transforms the current display industry beyond the backplane limits. The pixel circuit integrated micro‐LED (PIMLED) does not need an active‐matrix backplane but has an active‐pixel circuit into it. The proposed PIMLED is compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic‐based transfer technology and free from angular misalignment during vertical integration.








Abstract
Recent advances in mass transfer technology are expected to bring next‐generation micro light‐emitting diodes (µLED) displays into reality, although reliable integration of the active‐matrix backplane with the transferred µLEDs remains as a challenge. Here, the µLED display technology is innovated by demonstrating pixel circuit‐integrated micro‐LEDs (PIMLEDs) and integrating them onto a transparent glass substrate. The PIMLED comprises of low‐temperature poly‐silicon transistors and GaN µLED. The square‐shaped PIMLED is designed to secure a larger process margin but to reduce misalignment in the subsequent bonding process. Its unique four‐fold rotational symmetric design together with concentric circular pixel electrodes of the substrate makes their massive transfer compatible with intrinsic randomness of fluidic‐based transfer and free from angular misalignment during wafer bonding. The vertically integrated pixels show similar optical and electrical properties regardless of four possible arrangements. It is demonstrated that a 96 × 96 PIMLED display on a transparent glass substrate, which is expected to open a door to novel form‐factor free and transparent µLED displays.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A reversible switching between colored and bleached phases of three colors of inorganic perovskite smart windows is induced using dimethyl sulfoxide vapor at room temperature. Compared with normal houses in field tests, the model houses with three colors of smart windows reached a maximum indoor temperature drop of 2.6, 3.6, and 4.2 °C at noon, respectively, showing excellent energy‐saving potential.








Abstract
Perovskite smart windows (PSWs) are widely investigated owing to excellent thermochromic properties, while restricted by poor transition performance and cycle stability. Herein, dimethyl sulfoxide vapor is utilized as an induction reagent for rapid reversible switching at room temperature between the colored and bleached phases. To obtain PSWs with different optical properties and transition performance, red CsPbIBr2, yellow Rb0.5Cs0.5PbIBr2 and brown CsSn0.1Pb0.9IBr2 are prepared through alloying. The perovskites can exhibit reversible switching at 27.4–34.3 °C within 1.9–5.1 min. Even after 100 cycles, they exhibit remarkable stability of luminous transmittance (retention ≥97.4%) and transition time (retention ≥97.6%). Experimental characterization proves that the reversible switching occurs between colored three‐dimension perovskite phase and bleached zero‐dimension perovskite phase. In the field test (air temperature = 21.6–26.5 °C), model houses with PSWs exhibit a maximum indoor temperature drop of 4.2 °C. Furthermore, they exhibit considerable temperature modulation ability up to 7.9 °C under a solar simulator (temperature of the control model house = 60 °C). The decrease in the luminous transmittance of the PSWs after 20 days is 2.9%, indicating excellent long‐term stability. This study offers PSWs with prominent transition performance and long cycle stability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Left‐ and right‐handed magnons, thermally generated in a compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, propagate efficiently through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Within NiO, these magnons undergo distinct decay processes, unveiling a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission induced by interfacial spin‐flop coupling. These findings provide new insights for advancing chirality‐based magnonics.








Abstract
The chirality of magnons, exhibiting left‐ and right‐handed polarizations analogous to the counterparts of spin‐up and spin‐down, has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing. However, the potential of this paradigm is constrained by the controllable excitation and transmission of chiral magnons. Here, the magnon transmission is explored in the Gd3Fe5O12/NiO/Pt structures. It is demonstrated that both left‐ and right‐handed magnon modes, thermally generated in the compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12, can efficiently propagate through the antiferromagnetic NiO layer. Remarkably, these modes undergo distinct decay processes in NiO, manifested by different evolutions of the spin diffusion length with temperature. This behavior can be explained by an exchange model rooted in the spin‐flop magnetic configuration between Gd3Fe5O12 and NiO, which establishes a chiral selection rule for magnon transmission. These findings offer significant fundamental insight into controlling chiral magnons, opening avenues for chirality‐based magnonics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The “bifunctional group modulation strategy” enables precise emission wavelength control while maintaining exceptionally narrow FWHM values. Non‐sensitized pure green OLEDs based on DBNDS‐TPh exhibited peak EQE of 34.5% and 36.0%, with CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.76) and (0.19, 0.75) at the doping concentration of 1 and 3 wt.%. This is the first instance of a green OLED in a bottom‐emitting device structure achieving a CIEy value of 0.76.








Abstract
Herein, a parallel “bifunctional group” modulation method is proposed to achieve controlled modulation of the emission wavelength and full‐width at half‐maximum (FWHM) values. As a result, three proof‐of‐concept emitters, namely DBNDS‐TPh, DBNDS‐DFPh, and DBNDS‐CNPh, are designed and synthesized, with the first functional dibenzo[b,d]thiophene unit concurrently reducing the bandgap and elevate their triplet state energy. A second functional group 1,1′:3′,1″‐triphenyl, and electron acceptors 1,3‐difluorobenzene and benzonitrile, respectively, to deepen the HOMO and LUMO levels. Accordingly, the CIE coordinates of DBNDS‐TPh, DBNDS‐DFPh, and DBNDS‐CNPh are (0.13, 0.77), (0.14, 0.77), and (0.14, 0.76) respectively, in a dilute toluene solution. This marks the first instance of achieving a CIEy value of 0.77 in dilute toluene solutions. Significantly, the non‐sensitized pure‐green OLEDs based on DBNDS‐TPh and DBNDS‐DFPh demonstrate peak EQE of 35.0% and 34.5%, with corresponding CIE coordinates of (0.18, 0.75), (0.17, 0.76) at the doping concentration of 1 wt.%, representing the first green OLED with a CIEy value reaching 0.76 in a bottom‐emitting device structure as reported in the literature.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The crystallization mechanism of the biomimetic calcification method triggers a secondary conformational transition of proteins from α‐helix to β‐sheet in solvents. The adoption of the β‐sheet conformation enhances the affinity for metal ions, thereby intensifying the competitive interaction with organic ligands and expediting crystal formation and encapsulation.








Abstract
Biomimetic calcification is a micro‐crystallization process that mimics the natural biomineralization process, where biomacromolecules regulate the formation of inorganic minerals. In this study, it is presented that a protein‐assisted biomimetic calcification method for the in situ synthesis of nitrogen‐doped metal‐organic framework (MOF) materials. A series of unique core‐shell structures are created by utilizing proteins as templates and guiding agents in the nucleation step, creating ideal conditions for shell growth. To further understand the influence of the protein and organic ligand on the morphology of the MOF shell, the competing mechanism toward metal ions is supposed. Through systematic experiments and analyses, a strategy to construct unique precursor structures by controlling calcification nucleation is proposed. After carbonization, protein‐containing precursors exhibit exceptional porous characteristics, stability, and high nitrogen content. These attributes make them promising materials as sulfur hosts in lithium‐sulfur batteries (LSB). Electrochemical tests confirm that biomimetic calcification‐assisted 3D carbonaceous structure can effectively immobilize dissolved polysulfides, demonstrating strong adsorption and catalytic capabilities. This discovery not only opens up new avenues for employing biomimetic calcification as a sustainable method for batteries but also enlightens the fields of materials science, catalytic chemistry, and energy storage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
K2FeSiO4 is synthesized and utilized as a cathode material for potassium‐ion batteries. This compound offers advantages including high elemental abundance, low cost, and structural stability. Ultrahigh capacity can be achieved through charge compensation involving Fe cations and O anions during cycling. Additionally, the strong Si─O bond can effectively immobilize O anions to prevent excessive lattice oxygen loss.








Abstract
Single‐electron transfer, low alkali metal contents, and large‐molecular masses limit the capacity of cathodes. This study uses a cost‐effective and light‐molecular‐mass orthosilicate material, K2FeSiO4, with a high initial potassium content, as a cathode for potassium‐ion batteries to enable the transfer of more than one electron. Despite the limited valence change of Fe ions during cycling, K2FeSiO4 can undergo multiple electron transfers via successive oxygen anionic redox reactions to generate a high reversible capacity. Although the formation of O‒O dimers in K2FeSiO4 occur upon removing large amounts of potassium, the strong binding effect of Si on O mitigates irreversible oxygen release and voltage degradation during cycling. K2FeSiO4 achieves 236 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1, with an energy density of 520 Wh kg−1, which can be comparable with commercial LiFePO4 materials. Moreover, it also exhibits 1400 stable cycles under high‐current conditions. These findings enhance the potential commercialization prospects for potassium‐ion batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Using food‐safe sargassum nanocellulose as the binder framework, combined with food‐grade additives, a highly biocompatible fully ingestible supercapacitor is successfully employed. This design introduces high mechanical strength and fast ion transport behavior of the nanofiber, achieving a disposable power supply and electrical stimulation antibacterial in vivo, which provides a promising alternative power source for novel medical electronic devices.








Abstract
Small high‐performance energy modules have significant practical value in the biomedical field, such as painless diagnosis, alleviation of gastrointestinal discomfort, and electrical stimulation therapy. However, due to performance limitations and safety concerns, it is a formidable challenge to design a small, emerging ingestible power supply. Here, a fully ingestible supercapacitor (FISC) constructed of sargassum cellulose nanofiber is presented. FISCs exhibit an electrode areal capacitance of 2.29 F cm−2 and a high energy density of 307 µWh cm−2. Furthermore, over 90% of the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli is achieved during the self‐discharge process. Therefore, following insertion into an enteric capsule, this device can enable a disposable power supply and electrostimulation for bacteriostasis in the intestine after being swallowed by a human, which offers new possibilities for scientific and simple therapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel advanced oxidation strategy leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials, facilitating the decomposition of H2O2 to generate •OH and •O2− free radicals, which promote oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. It effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine‐containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid‐state regeneration process.








Abstract
Among direct recycling methods for spent lithium‐ion batteries, solid‐state regeneration is the route with minimal bottlenecks for industrial application and is highly compatible with the current industrial cathode materials production processes. However, surface structure degradation and interfacial impurities of spent cathodes significantly hinder Li+ replenishment during restoration. Herein, we propose a unique advanced oxidation strategy that leverages the inherent catalytic activity of spent layered cathode materials to address these challenges. This strategy decomposes H2O2 to generate •OH and •O2− free radicals, facilitating oxidation reactions with the surface of the spent cathode. As a result, this approach effectively elevates the Ni valence state, modifies the surface microstructure, and eliminates fluorine‐containing interface impurities, thereby promoting the solid‐state regeneration process. The regenerated LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes demonstrate a specific capacity of 206 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, comparable to commercially available cathodes. Meanwhile, this advanced oxidation strategy proves adaptable and scalable for treating industrial dismantled LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 black mass. A 3.1 Ah pouch cell assembled with the regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits impressive capacity retention of 74% after 500 cycles. Additionally, a techno‐economic analysis reveals that this strategy possesses low energy consumption, minimal environmental footprint, and high economic viability, suggesting its suitability for the battery recycling industry.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work focuses on the synergistic control between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in the molecular ferroelectric material, TMCM‐MnCl3. It demonstrates that FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical writing can trigger FP reversal. This enables a seamless transition between electric‐writing optical‐reading and optical‐writing electrical‐reading modes, hinting at the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory in ferroelectric fields.









Abstract
Utilizing the correlation among diverse physical properties to facilitate multiplexing and multistate memory is anticipated to emerge as an efficient strategy to enhance memory capacity, achieve device miniaturization, and ensure information security. As an important functional material, ferroelectrics have long been considered as a potential candidate in multistate memory devices. Furthermore, the integration of optical response offers an alternative path to realizing multiplexing features, further enhancing the versatility and efficiency of these devices. However, combining ferroelectricity and optical activity is always challenging because ferroelectricity is very sensitive to the crystal structure. In this study, on the correlation between ferroelectric polarization (FP) and optical properties in molecular ferroelectric material, trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichloromanganese (TMCM‐MnCl3) is reported. This research demonstrated that the FP can modulate the photoluminescence (PL) emission, while optical illumination can trigger FP reversal. Based on these, both electric‐writing optical‐reading (EWOR) and optical‐writing electrical‐reading (OWER) modes have been conclusively established, and the seamless transition between these two modes can be achieved by adjusting the excitation light intensity. These findings reveal an intriguing physical interconnection and imply the viability of implementing multiplexing and multistate memory functionalities in systems based on ferroelectrics.

An anti‐scattering CsPbBr3 scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging significantly suppresses light scattering and enhances the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. The scintillator array provides a high spatial‐resolution 3D reconstructed tooth image at a low X‐ray dosage in CT imaging.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) imaging has emerge as an effective medical diagnostic technique due to its rapid and 3D imaging capabilities, often employing indirect imaging methods through scintillator materials. Arraying scintillators that can confine light scattering to enable high‐resolution CT imaging remains an area of ongoing exploration for emerging perovskite scintillators. Here an anti‐scattering cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) scintillator array embedded within a polyurethane acrylate matrix for CT imaging using a cost‐effective solution‐processed method is reported. Due to the large refractive index contrast between the scintillator and matrix, photon propagation can be well confined within the CsPbBr3 scintillator array to significantly suppress the light scattering and enhance the light collection efficiency by nearly two times compared to the monolithic film. Furthermore, the scintillator array exhibits low‐dosage and high‐resolution CT imaging capability by reconstructing a 3D tooth image with a good spatial resolution of 20.1 lp cm−1 at a low effective dose of 0.22 mSv. This work highlights that the CsPbBr3 scintillator array is a highly promising candidate for CT imaging.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
2D porous silica nanosheets (PSN)/MXene nanochannel interlayer with selective cation transport characteristics facilitates lithium ion rapid transport while rejects translocation of polysulfides, and the raised p‐band center of the surface O on PSN helps enhance polysulfide conversion kinetics. This work well addresses polysulfide shuttling and dendritic lithium growth, opening up new avenues for expanding application of nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Commercialization of lithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries is largely limited by polysulfide shuttling and sluggish kinetics. Herein, 2D nanochannel interlayer composed of alternatively‐stacked porous silica nanosheets (PSN) and Ti3C2Tx‐MXene are developed. The 2D nanochannels with selective cation transport characteristics facilitate lithium ion rapid transport, while reject the translocation of polysulfide anions across the separator. The hydroxylated MXene shifts the p‐band center of the surface O on PSN closer to the Fermi level, leading to strong absorptive/catalytic effect for polysulfides and thus fast polysulfide transformation kinetics. Together with the ion/electron bi‐conduction function of PSN/MXene, the Li–S batteries deliver high initial capacity of 1443 mAh g−1 at 0.1 C, low‐capacity decay rate of 0.049% per cycle over 800 cycles at 2 C, and excellent rate capability. At a high sulfur loading of 5.2 mg cm−2, the cells present higher areal specific capacity than commercial lithium ion batteries. The pouch cells with lean electrolyte (E/S = 3.9 µL mg−1) yield a capacity of 2‐Ah at 100 mA, high energy density and excellent cycling stability. This contribution opens up new avenues for expanding application of 2D nanofluidics in electrochemical energy storage and conversion.

<guid>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202417409?af=R</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work systematically explores piezoelectric response of vitamin‐based self‐assemblies for power generation. Vitamin molecules can self‐assemble into different supramolecular structures exhibiting tunable predicted piezoelectric coefficients. Vitamin B7 D‐biotin (D‐BIO) self‐assemblies with high piezoelectricity are fabricated into piezoelectric devices for human motion monitoring and energy harvesting. These findings will facilitate the exploration and development of biomolecule‐based piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Structural diversity of biomolecules leads to various supramolecular organizations and asymmetric architectures of self‐assemblies with significant piezoelectric response. However, the piezoelectricity of biomolecular self‐assemblies has not been fully explored and the relationship between supramolecular structures and piezoelectricity remains poorly understood, which hinders the development of piezoelectric biomaterials. Herein, for the first time, the piezoelectricity of vitamin‐based self‐assemblies for power generation is systematically explored. X‐ray diffraction studies revealed that vitamin molecules can self‐assemble into different supramolecular structures, which exhibited tunable piezoelectric coefficients ranging from 3.8 to 42.8 pC N−1 by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Notably, vitamin B7 D‐biotin (D‐BIO) self‐assemblies exhibited superior piezoelectricity due to low crystal symmetry and high polarization of supramolecular arrangements. The D‐BIO assemblies‐based piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) produced output voltages of ≈0.8 V under a mechanical force of 47 N, showing high mechanical durability after 5400 pressing‐releasing cycles and high stability of at least three months. The PENG‐based wearable sensor successfully detected bending motions of human limbs. Furthermore, the PENG‐based insole converted biomechanical energy into stable electrical energy upon foot movement, illuminating 12 light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). This work fills knowledge gaps in piezoelectricity of vitamin‐based self‐assemblies, providing paradigms for realizing high‐performance piezoelectric biomaterials through supramolecular engineering.

<title>Shear‐Mediated Stabilization of Spin Spiral Order in Multiferroic NiI2</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The magneto‐structural phases of 2D multiferroic NiI2 are studied using resonant magnetic X‐ray scattering and X‐ray diffraction. A change of magnetic symmetry from incommensurate collinear to helical spin‐spiral at a structural transition involving a significant interlayer shear is observed. These results highlight the role for interlayer magnetic exchange for driving the magnetic ground state and associated spin‐induced ferroelectricity in NiI2.








Abstract
Type‐II multiferroicity from non‐collinear spin order is recently explored in the van der Waals material NiI2. Despite the importance for improper ferroelectricity, the microscopic mechanism of the helimagnetic order remains poorly understood. Here, the magneto‐structural phases of NiI2 are investigated using resonant magnetic X‐ray scattering (RXS) and X‐ray diffraction. Two competing magnetic phases are identified. Below 60 K, an incommensurate magnetic reflection (q ≈ [0.143,0,1.49] reciprocal lattice units) is observed which exhibits finite circular dichroism in RXS, signaling the inversion symmetry‐breaking helimagnetic ground state. At elevated temperature, in the non‐polar phase (60 K < T < 75 K), a distinct q ≈ [0.087,0.087,1.5] magnetic order is observed, attributed to a collinear incommensurate (CI) state. The first‐order CI‐helix transition is concomitant with a structural transition characterized by a significant interlayer shear, which drives the helimagnetic ground state as evidenced by a mean‐field Heisenberg model including interlayer exchange and its coupling to the structural distortion. These findings identify interlayer magneto‐structural coupling as the key driver behind multiferroicity in NiI2.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Fluorine (F) doping is an efficient strategy to facilitate the in situ aggregation of Cu single atoms and stabilize Cu+ species. Consequently, the F‐doped Cu single‐atom catalyst exhibits outstanding performance in CO2 electroreduction toward multicarbon products, achieving ultrahigh Cu utilization. This is attributed to the formation of abundant Cu nanocrystals with a high ratio of stable Cu+ species.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of multicarbon compounds from CO2 is a promising method for storing renewable electricity and addressing global CO2 issues. Single‐atom catalysts are promising candidates for CO2 reduction, but producing high‐value multicarbon (C2+) products using a single‐atom structure remains a significant challenge. In this study, a fluorine doping strategy is proposed to facilitate the reconstruction of isolated Cu atoms, promoting multicarbon generation. The in situ formed Cu nanocrystals contain a substantial amount of stable Cu+ species, demonstrating remarkable activity for CO2−to‐multicarbon conversion. Notably, they achieve the highest Cu utilization, with a C2+ partial current density of −2.01 A mgper Cu−1and a C2+ formation rate of 7.03 mmol h−1 mgper Cu−1at ≈−1 V versus RHE. In situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations confirm the crucial role of fluorine atoms in structural evolution and electrolysis.

A data‐driven design strategy is developed for UC therapeutic nanozymes. The optimal CT‐imageable oral UC therapeutic nanozyme SrDy2O4 is successfully discovered and the high‐dimensional structure‐activity relationships between the material database and nanozyme UC therapeutics are further elucidated by machine learning model interpretation in combination with the SISSO method.









Abstract
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic gastrointestinal inflammatory disorder with rising prevalence. Due to the recurrent and difficult‐to‐treat nature of UC symptoms, current pharmacological treatments fail to meet patients' expectations. This study presents a machine learning‐assisted high‐throughput screening strategy to expedite the discovery of efficient nanozymes for UC treatment. Therapeutic requirements, including antioxidant property, acid stability, and zeta potential, are quantified and predicted by using a machine learning model. Non‐quantifiable attributes, including intestinal barrier repair efficacy and biosafety, are assessed via high‐throughput screening. Feature significance analysis, sure independence screening, and sparsifying operator symbolic regression reveal the high‐dimensional structure‐activity relationships between material features and therapeutic needs. SrDy2O4 with high stability, low toxicity, targeting ability, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capability is identified, which reduces ROS production, lowers cytochrome C levels in cytoplasm, and inhibits apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Mice treated with SrDy2O4 show improvements in colon length and body weight compared with dextran sodium sulfate salt‐treated model group. Transcriptomic and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses show that SrDy2O4 boosts beneficial gut bacteria, and decreases pathogenic bacteria, thereby effectively restoring gut microbiota balance. Moreover, SrDy2O4 offers the advantage of X‐ray imaging without side effects.

<title>Stabilizing Layered Oxide Cathodes Based on Universal Surface Residual Alkali Conversion Chemistry for Rechargeable Secondary Batteries</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This work presents a universal surface residual alkali conversion strategy based on NH4F treatment and ring‐opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. The approach transforms residual alkali into a stable polymer coating which can enhance interfacial stability, suppress lattice oxygen release and reduce side reactions, providing a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for layered oxide cathodes in practical application.








Abstract
Layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) are attractive cathode candidates for rechargeable secondary batteries because of their high theoretical capacity. Unfortunately, LTMOs suffer from severe capacity attenuation, voltage decay, and sluggish kinetics, resulting from irreversible lattice oxygen evolution and unstable cathode‐electrolyte interface. Besides, LTMOs accumulate surface residual alkali species, like hydroxides and carbonates, during synthesis, limiting their practical application. Herein, a universal strategy is suggested to in situ convert surface residual alkali into a stable polymer coating layer for LTMOs, thus turning wastes into treasure. The formation process of polymer coating involves NH4F treatment to consume residual alkali, then utilizing generated fluorides to induce the ring‐opening polymerization of tetrahydrofuran. Implementing this strategy to Li‐rich Mn‐based cathode materials (LRM) results in a notable reduction in voltage hysteresis, along with enhanced kinetics and cycling stability in lithium‐ion batteries. With this layer of encapsulation, surface lattice oxygen release and layered‐to‐spinel phase transition of LRM are significantly alleviated with minimal mechanical degradation and surface parasitic reactions. Such strategy can also be applied to air‐sensitive sodium‐rich LTMOs in sodium‐ion batteries, which showcases superior universality. This work might provide a promising solution to overcome residual alkali and interfacial instability issues for LTMOs in practical application.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This article introduces an innovative method, achieving molecular‐level epitaxial growth of metal–organic frameworks (MOF) on BiVO4 photoanodes by precisely controlling the concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. The seamless interface of BiVO4/MOF optimizes electron transfer and reduces recombination losses, elevating the overall efficiency of the PEC water oxidation.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation at the semiconductor/cocatalyst interface is crucial for high‐performance photoelectrodes, as it directly influences the availability of surface charges for solar water oxidation. However, establishing strong molecular‐level connections between these interfaces to achieve superior interfacial quality presents significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative electrochemical etching method that generates a high concentration of oxygen vacancy sites on BiVO4 surfaces (Ov‐BiVO4), enabling interactions with the oxygen‐rich ligands of MIL‐101. This reduces the formation energy and promotes conformal growth on BiVO4. The Ov‐BiVO4/MIL‐101 composite exhibits an ideal semiconductor/cocatalyst interface, achieving an impressive photocurrent density of 5.91 mA cm−2 at 1.23 VRHE, along with excellent stability. This high‐performing photoanode enables an unbiased tandem device with an Ov‐BiVO4/MIL‐101‐Si solar cell system, achieving a solar‐to‐hydrogen efficiency of 4.33%. The molecular‐level integration mitigates surface states and enhances the internal electric field, facilitating the migration of photogenerated holes into the MIL‐101 overlayer. This process activates highly efficient Fe catalytic sites, which effectively adsorb water molecules, lowering the energy barrier for water oxidation and improving interfacial kinetics. Further studies confirm the broad applicability of oxygen vacancy‐induced molecular epitaxial growth in various MOFs, offering valuable insights into defect engineering for optimizing interfaces and enhancing photocatalytic activity.

Simply adding a nucleating agent N,N′‐(1,4‐phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA) to poly(2,5‐bis(3‐alkylthiophen‐2‐yl)thieno[3,2‐b]thiophene (PBTTT‐C14) precisely tunes its crystallization and maximizes structural order. The improved molecular packing reduces disorder and elevates charge mobility. With optimized doping, this polymer achieves remarkable electrical conductivity (up to 1968 S cm⁻¹) and a power factor ≈176 µW m−1 K−2, expanding possibilities for high‐performance thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Controlling the microstructure of semiconducting polymers is critical for optimizing thermoelectric performance, yet remains challenging, requiring complex processing techniques like alignment. In this study, a straightforward strategy is introduced to enhance the thermoelectric properties of semi‐crystalline polymer films by incorporating minimal amounts of nucleating agents, a method widely used in traditional polymer industries. By blending less than 1 wt% of N,N′‐(1,4‐phenyl)diisonicotinamide (PDA) into poly(2,5‐bis(3‐alkylthiophen‐2‐yl)thieno[3,2‐b]thiophene) (PBTTT‐C14), controlled modulation of crystallization behavior is achieved, resulting in reduced structural disorder and enhanced charge carrier mobility. Systematic investigations reveal that an optimal PDA loading of 0.9 wt% increases the crystallization degree by 45% compared to pristine PBTTT‐C14 films. Under these optimized conditions, the PDA‐modified PBTTT‐C14 films exhibit a maximum electrical conductivity of 1,894 S cm−1 and a maximum power factor of 176 µW m−1 K−2, showing improvements of 96% and 433%, respectively, over doped pristine PBTTT‐C14 films. These gains are attributed to the synergistic effects of polymer chain extension and reduced grain boundary resistance, which collectively enhance charge transport efficiency. Additionally, ion exchange doping is found to maintain a high charge carrier concentration while preserving the crystallinity introduced by PDA, paving the way for advanced thermoelectric materials and next‐generation polymer‐based electronics.

Cellulose nanofiber and alginate from natural sargassum are used to prepare a fire‐retardant structural material through a hydrogel layer‐by‐layer method. This bio‐based material has excellent mechanical properties, thermal stability, and fire retardancy. This work greatly improves the utilization of seaweed residues and natural polymers, provides a bio‐based fire‐retardant strategy, and has important potential in the future development of high‐performance fiber‐based materials.









Abstract
With increasing concern about the environmental pollution of petrochemical plastics, people are constantly exploring environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative materials. Compared with petrochemical materials, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of mechanical properties, thermal properties, cost, and biodegradability. However, the flammability of cellulose hinders its practical application to a certain extent, so improving the fire‐retardant properties of cellulose nanofiber‐based materials has become a research focus. Here, cellulose nanofiber and alginate are extracted from abundant natural sargassum as high‐strength nanoscale building blocks, and then a sargassum cellulose fire‐retardant structural material is prepared through a bottom‐up hydrogel layer‐by‐layer method. The structural materials obtained incorporate excellent mechanical properties (≈297 MPa), thermal stability (≈200 °C), low thermal expansion coefficient (≈7.17 × 10−6 K−1), and fire‐retardant properties. This work largely improves the utilization of seaweed residue and natural polymers, providing a bio‐based fire‐retardant strategy, and has a wide range of development prospects in the field of fiber‐based high‐performance structural materials in the future.

A unique Bi‐RuO2 single‐atom alloy oxide is rational designed and achieved by phase engineering of the hexagonal close‐packed RuBi single‐atom alloy, to boost oxygen evolution electrocatalysis. The incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation, enabling a practical proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm−2.









Abstract
Engineering nanomaterials at single‐atomic sites can enable unprecedented catalytic properties for broad applications, yet it remains challenging to do so on RuO2‐based electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, the rational design and construction of Bi‐RuO2 single‐atom alloy oxide (SAAO) are presented to boost acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), via phase engineering a novel hexagonal close packed (hcp) RuBi single‐atom alloy. This Bi‐RuO2 SAAO electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 192 mV and superb stability over 650 h at 10 mA cm−2, enabling a practical PEMWE that needs only 1.59 V to reach 1.0 A cm−2 under industrial conditions. Operando differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy analysis, coupled with density functional theory studies, confirmed the adsorbate‐evolving mechanism on Bi‐RuO2 SAAO and that the incorporation of Bi1 improves the activity by electronic density optimization and the stability by hindering surface Ru demetallation. This work not only introduces a new strategy to fabricate high‐performance electrocatalysts at atomic‐level, but also demonstrates their potential use in industrial electrolyzers.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A Wenzel model is successfully constructed at the interface to achieve a super‐hydrophilic substrate, greatly alleviating the coffee‐ring effect during the large‐area perovskite film printing process. The highly hydrophilic nature of the interface, along with its unique microstructure, greatly facilitates the efficient and rapid deposition of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process.








Abstract
The coffee‐ring effect, caused by uneven deposition of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor solutions, leads to poor uniformity in perovskite films prepared through large‐area printing. In this work, the surface of SnO2 is roughened to construct a Wenzel model, successfully achieving a super‐hydrophilic interface. This modification significantly accelerates the spreading of the perovskite precursor solution, reducing the response delay time of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing process. Additionally, the micro‐spherical depression structure on the SnO2 surface effectively inhibits the migration of colloidal particles toward the edges of liquid film, trapping perovskite colloidal particles at the buried interfaces and improving film uniformity. Due to the synergistic effect of super‐hydrophilicity and micro‐rough structure on the surface of SnO2, leading to a substantial improvement in the quality of perovskite crystals. Therefore, the efficiency of printing prepared flexible devices (0.101 cm2) reached 25.42% (certified 25.12%). Moreover, the efficiency of rigid and flexible large‐scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs) based on meniscus‐coating manufacture reached 21.34% and 16.99% (100 cm2), respectively, and demonstrated superior environmental stability by maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric conditions for 2000 h, offering practical guidance for fabricating high‐performance and stable large‐scale perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

A microglial‐biomimetic memantine‐loaded polydopamine nanomedicine, PDA‐Mem@M, that achieves blood‐brain barrier penetration and brain inflammation site targeting for rapid and precise treatment of depression is designed. PDA‐Mem@M effectively alleviate depression‐like behaviors. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti‐inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.








Abstract
Depression is a common psychiatric disorder, and monoamine‐based antidepressants as first‐line therapy remain ineffective in some patients. The synergistic modulation of neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity could be a major strategy for treating depression. In this study, an inflammation‐targeted microglial biomimetic system, PDA‐Mem@M, is reported for treating depression. Microglial membrane‐coated nanoparticles penetrate the blood‐brain barrier and facilitate microglial targeting. Subsequently, owing to the excellent free radical‐scavenging capacity, PDA‐Mem@M attenuate the brain inflammatory microenvironment. After on‐demand release from the nanoparticles, memantine increases the expression of brain‐derived neurotrophic factors and reverses the loss of synaptic dendritic spines. Further, in vivo studies demonstrate that PDA‐Mem@M effectively alleviate depression‐like behaviors to a greater extent than memantine or polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA) monotherapy. This synergistic strategy, with satisfactory biosafety and strong anti‐inflammatory and synaptic plasticity restoration effects, is conducive to advances in depression therapy.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Distinct interactions between phytic acid and various polymers are discovered first and leveraged to construct a gradient ionic hydrogel‐based pressure sensor, which offers excellent sensitivity, wide sensing range, and superior low‐pressure detection performance. The gradient ionic hydrogel‐based sensor recognizes subtle pressures from acoustic waves and airflow, moderate pressures due to speaking and finger pressing, and high magnitudes of plantar pressures.








Abstract
Ionic conductive hydrogels have emerged as an excellent option for constructing dielectric layers of interfacial iontronic sensors. Among these, gradient ionic hydrogels, due to the intrinsic gradient elastic modulus, can achieve a wide range of pressure responses. However, the fabrication of gradient hydrogels with optimal mechanical and sensing properties remains a challenge. In this study, it is discovered first that phytic acid (PA) interacts in remarkably distinct manners (i.e., plasticizing effects and phase separation) with different polymers (i.e., polyacrylamide and polyacrylic acid). This distinctive PA‐polymer interacting mechanism is innovatively utilized to construct a modulus gradient ionic hydrogel through a simple precursor solution infiltration approach. The gradient hydrogel‐based flexible pressure sensor not only achieves a high sensitivity (9.00 kPa−1, <15 kPa) and a broad sensing range (from ≈3.7 Pa to 1.2 MPa) simultaneously, but also exhibits superior low pressure sensing performance. It successfully recognizes the subtle pressure due to acoustic waves and airflow, as well as the moderate pressure due to speaking and finger pressing and the high magnitude of plantar pressure. In addition, the gradient hydrogel demonstrates remarkable antibacterial properties and biocompatibility. This functional hydrogel with excellent sensing performance and bioactivity exhibits exceptional potential for wearable sensing applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel planar three‐electrode structure is constructed on the Ti3+ self‐doping 0.5Ba(Zr0.2TI0.8)O3‐0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 (BZT‐BCT) ceramic surface that has an obvious photovoltaic and pyroelectric response. Through a specific polarization method, the device shows a region‐dependent photoelectric response. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are achieved on a single ferroelectric ceramic chip.








Abstract
Differentiating photoelectric response in a single material with a simple approach is desirable for all‐in‐one optoelectronic logical devices. In ferroelectric materials, significantly distinct photoelectric features should be observed if they are in diverse polarization states, unveiling a possible pathway to realize multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates through ferroelectric polarization design. In this study, the Ti3+ self‐doping strategy is first applied to 0.5Ba(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3‐0.5(Ba0.7Ca0.3)TiO3 ferroelectric ceramics (BZT‐BCT‐xT) through co‐firing metallic Ti powders and BZT‐BCT powders to enhance photoelectric output. Subsequently, on the BZT‐BCT‐3T ceramic surface that has optimal photoelectric properties, three individual regions are separated and heterogeneously polarized by using a novel planar three‐electrodes structure. Intriguing illumination region‐dependent photocurrent directions are demonstrated in this as‐fabricated device. Based on this, five basic optoelectronic logic gates are integrated into single ferroelectric ceramic via fully light‐controlled methods, including “AND”, “OR”, “NOT”, “NAND” and “NOR”. These gates can be readily switched by simply altering the output electrodes or light intensity of 405 nm LED modulating light. This work not only puts forward an innovative strategy for designing ferroelectric optoelectronic logic gates, but also provides feasibility for more ferroelectric materials to be applied in logical devices.

<title>Supramolecular Organic Nanofiller: A New Reinforcement Strategy for Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks Toward Upcycling of Carbon Fiber Composites</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A new reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers via asynchronous polymerization is proposed. The reinforcement and recyclability of the supramolecular organic nanofillers on DCPN considerably exceed those of traditional methods. This reinforcement strategy is versatile and can be successfully applied for the upcycling of high‐performance CF composites.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks (DCPN) provide an important solution to the challenging recyclability of thermoset elastomers. However, dynamic bonds exhibit relatively weak bond energies, considerably decreasing the mechanical properties of DCPN. Herein, a novel reinforcement strategy for DCPN involving the in situ formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers through asynchronous polymerization is proposed. Owing to the difference in the reactivity of the isocyanate groups and the gradual deblocking of aldimine, asynchronous cross‐linking of hexamethylene diisocyanate and isocyanate‐terminated prepolymer containing dynamic oxime–urethane bonds with the deblocked tris(2‐aminoethyl)amine facilitates the transition from the molecular interpenetration of chains into immiscible polymerization. This results in thermodynamic incompatibility between the hyperbranched clusters and long chains, inducing a spontaneous formation of supramolecular organic nanofillers. Compared to traditional reinforcement strategies, supramolecular organic nanofillers considerably improve the mechanical properties of DCPN. Furthermore, the supramolecular interactions between hyperbranched clusters and dynamic oxime–urethane bonds enable the network with excellent recyclability. The unique reinforcement and recyclability of the prepared DCPN allow their combination with carbon fibers (CF) to form CF composites with outstanding properties for personal‐protection applications, achieving CF composite upcycling. This study offers a novel strategy on the reinforcement of DCPN and the upcycling of high‐performance CF composites.

Based on two kinds of biomolecule‐MOFs, we construct a self‐powered multi‐functional wearable device by combining Zn‐Car_MOF and patterned PDMS to achieve various environmental energy collection (water droplets, ocean energy, and e‐bike driving) and human gait detection, when Thy loaded Cu‐HHTP_MOF combined with wearable fibers are cooperated with Zn‐Car_TPHG, achieving electrocatalytic ROS generation and drug releasing synergistic sterilization.








Abstract
New types of metal–organic framework (MOF) materials have great potential in solving the current global dilemma on energy, environment, and medical care. Herein, based on two kinds of biomolecule‐MOFs (Bio‐MOFs) with favorable biocompatibility and degradation‐reconstruction characteristics, we have established a self‐powered muti‐functional device to achieve an efficient and broad‐spectrum environmental energy collection and biomedical applications. Combining Zn(II) and carnosine‐based Zn‐Car_MOF possessing a high piezoelectric response (d33 = 11.17 pm V−1) with patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, a tribo‐piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator (TPHG) is constructed with a synergy output of triboelectric and piezoelectric effects. The Zn‐Car_TPHG demonstrates a high output performance (131 V at 100 kPa) and a wide range of pressure response (1 Pa–100 kPa), possessing applications in environmental energy collection and biomedical sensors. To expand the application of the wearable device, a conductive hexagonal prism MOF (Cu3(2,3,6,7,10,11‐hexahydroxytriphenylene)2 (Cu‐HHTP)) is synthesized and employed to load thymol (Thy). Cooperating with Zn‐Car_TPHG, the resulting Cu‐HHTP/Thy can achieve an efficient self‐powered ROS (singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (·OH)) generation and drug synergistic broad‐spectrum sterilization effect (efficiency ≥ 98%). In a word, the flexible wearable device based on the muti‐functional Bio‐MOFs is sustainable and environmentally friendly, possessing wide application potential in fields of environmental energy collection, biosensors, and self‐powered antibacterial.

The high‐entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 cathode material prepared by ultrafast high temperature shock inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves the reversible and stable multielectron transfer, fabulous cycling stability and excellent wide‐temperature range operation from −50 to 60 °C. The ultrafast sintering strategy provides a broad platform for the development of polyanionic materials for long‐lifespan and all‐climate sodium‐ion batteries.








Abstract
Avoiding severe structural distortion, irreversible phase transition, and realizing the stabilized multielectron redox are vital for promoting the development of high‐performance NASICON‐type cathode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high‐entropy Na3.45V0.4Fe0.4Ti0.4Mn0.45Cr0.35(PO4)3 (HE‐Na3.45TMP) cathode material is prepared by ultrafast high‐temperature shock, which inhibits the possibility of phase separation and achieves reversible and stable multielectron transfer of 2.4/2.8 e− at voltage range of 2.0–4.45/1.5–4.45 V versus Na+/Na (the capacity of 137.2/162.0 mAh g−1). The galvanostatic charge/discharge and in‐situ X‐ray diffraction tests indicate the sequential redox reactions and approximate solid solution phase transition behavior of HE‐Na3.45TMP. Density functional theory calculations analyze the migration pathways and energy barriers, further confirming the superior reaction kinetics of HE‐Na3.45TMP. Accordingly, the HE‐Na3.45TMP exhibits outstanding wide temperature applicability and can operate stably in the temperature range of −50–60 °C, accompanied by a capacity retention of 92.8% after 400 cycles at −40 °C and a capacity of 73.7 mAh g−1 even at −50 °C. The assembled hard carbon//HE‐Na3.45TMP full‐cell offers an energy density of ≈301 Wh kg−1 based on total cathode and anode active mass, verifying the application feasibility of HE‐Na3.45TMP. This work provides an innovative and ultrafast pathway to rationally fabricate high‐performance cathodes for SIBs.

This work reports a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOFs which are exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
As an alternative to bulk counterparts, metal–organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles isolated within conductive mesoporous carbon matrices are of increasing interest for electrochemical applications. Although promising, a “clean” carbon surface is generally associated with poor compatibility and weak interactions with metal/ligand precursors, which leads to the growth of MOFs with inhomogeneous particle sizes on outer pore walls. Here, a general methodology for in situ synthesis of eight nanoMOF composites within mesochannels with high dispersity and stability are reported. Mesoporous polydopamine (mesoPDA)‐F127 nanospheres with unique surface chemistry, e.g., nanoconfined spaces, catechol functional groups, pyrrolic N doping, and hydrophilic PEO blocks, are found to be a suitable molecular platform. Sliced cross‐sectional TEM, HAADF‐STEM, and corresponding EDS elemental mapping, as well as nitrogen adsorption characterizations, are utilized to visualize the in situ growth process of ZIF‐8 nanoparticles. These careful analyses provides direct evidence that the highly dispersed ZIF‐8 is exclusively located inside the internal mesochannels. After moderate carbonization of the mesoPDA‐F127/ZIF‐8 nanocomposites, a prototype for a mesoporous carbon‐isolated ZIF‐8 nanostructure is achieved, which can regulate Zn2+ plating electrochemistry toward stable aqueous Zn batteries. This is the first report of the complete impregnation and even dispersion of nanoscale MOFs within the interior channels of mesoporous carbons.

A new charge loss and a voltage loss model are proposed and a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m−2 is achieved by the effective collection of interface tribo‐charges and the increase in load voltage during the charge extraction process.








Abstract
The effective collection of interfacial tribo‐charges and an increase in load voltage are two essential factors that improve the output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators. However, some tribo‐charges are hardly collected through one or multiple integrated side electrodes based on corona discharge, and their load voltages are limited by air breakdown in adjacent electrodes. In this study, a dynamic quasi‐dipole potential distribution model is proposed to systematically reveal the mechanisms of interfacial tribo‐charge loss. Based on this model, an optimization route is designed to reduce the interfacial charge loss stepwise, achieving a 15‐fold improvement in charge collection from the tribo‐interface. A potential difference enhancement strategy is used for the first time to increase the air breakdown threshold between the inner electrodes and increase the output voltage under a large load. By effective increase in charge collection efficiency and load voltage, a historical record output energy density of 5.03 J m−2 is obtained. This study refined and optimized the interfacial charge loss mechanisms and provided advanced guidance for efficiently extracting energy during the triboelectrification process.

An efficiently reactant‐enriched and mass traffic system is developed through integrating high‐curvature Pt nanocones with a 3D porous TiAl framework. The 3D multiple interconnected channels in TiAl boosts the mass transport rate, while the high curvature of Pt nanocones induces an ultrahigh local electric field, thereby accelerating the transfer of H3O+ during HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), as one of the most advanced methods for the green production of hydrogen, is greatly impeded by inefficient mass transfer. Here we present an efficiently reactant enriched and mass traffic system by integrating high‐curvature Pt nanocones with 3D porous TiAl framework to enhance mass transfer rate. Theoretical simulations, in situ Raman spectroscopy and potential‐dependent Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results disclose that the strong local electric field induced by high‐curvature Pt can greatly promote the H3O+ supply rate during HER, resulting in ∼1.6 times higher H3O+ concentration around the Pt nanocone than that in electrolyte. X‐ray computed tomography and molecular dynamic simulation demonstrate the diffusion coefficient of H3O+ in 3D TiAl framework surpasses that in commercial carbon support by more than 16.7 times. Consequently, Pt/TiAl‐nanocone exhibits a high mass activity of 17.2 mA cm−2Pt at an overpotential of 100 mV with an ultrahigh TOF value of 42.9 atom−1 s−1. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the Pt/TiAl‐nanocone cathode achieves an industrial‐scale current density of 1.0 A cm−2 with a cell voltage of 1.88 V at 60 °C and can operate stably for at least 800 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 137 µV h−1.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The generated local polarization piezoelectric field (LPPEF) can be significantly enhanced through ball milling piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) by adsorbing trace amounts of water under ambient humidity conditions. Under this circumstance, the energy barrier for water dissociation can be largely lowered, thus facilitating the breaking of H–O–H bonds and the generation of hydroxyl radicals.








Abstract
Combining piezocatalysts with mechanical ball milling for dissociating water to generate hydroxyl radicals (·OH) offers unprecedented opportunities for energy conversion and environmental remediation. However, the in‐depth insights into the relationship between water and local polarization piezoelectric electric field (LPPEF) are currently lacking, in particularly, the ·OH formation mechanism in ball milling driven piezocatalyst system is not systematically elucidated. To this end, the present work constructs a ball milling driven piezoelectric solid/liquid interface between piezoelectric Pb2B5O9Cl (PBOC) and different contents of water to investigate LPPEF initiated catalytic reaction. Results show that PBOC exhibits an excellent Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) degradation efficiency with a 68.94 and 12.43 times faster rate constant than traditional SiO2 and BaTiO3, respectively. Under ambient humidity condition, the lower energy barrier of water dissociation (0.23 eV) endows ·OH generation more energetically favorable than under the water‐oversaturated condition (0.66 eV), and trace water magnifies the polarizability of [BO3] and [BO4] units in PBOC to initiate an enhanced LPPEF, thus it enhances the trapping of lone pairs electrons in trace adsorbed water by holes to contribute a higher yield of ·OH. This study constructs a highly correlated field‐initiated electron transfer system that provides opportunities for promoting the performance of piezocatalytic materials.

Surface‐plasmon‐resonance (SPR) typically detects in the nanomolar range. A pH‐conditioning of a physisorbed biolayer, hosting trillions of capturing antibodies or probes enables SPR to detect a single protein or DNA‐strand in 0.1 mL of plasma. The pH‐conditioning transition the biolayer in a metastable state where a single affinity‐biding event can trigger an amplification mechanism involving a broad self‐propagating electrostatic rearrangement








Abstract
DNA can be readily amplified through replication, enabling the detection of a single‐target copy. A comparable performance for proteins in immunoassays has yet to be fully assessed. Surface‐plasmon‐resonance (SPR) serves as a probe capable of performing assays at concentrations typically around 10⁻⁹ molar. In this study, plasmonic single‐molecule assays for both proteins and DNA are demonstrated, achieving limits‐of‐detections (LODs) as low as 10⁻2⁰ molar (1 ± 1 molecule in 0.1 mL), even in human serum, in 1 h. This represents an improvement in typical SPR LODs by eleven orders‐of‐magnitude. The single‐molecule SPR assay is achieved with a millimeter‐wide surface functionalized with a physisorbed biolayer comprising trillions of recognition‐elements (antibodies or protein–probe complexes) which undergo an acidic or alkaline pH‐conditioning. Potentiometric and surface‐probing imaging experiments reveal the phenomenon underlying this extraordinary performance enhancement. The data suggest an unexplored amplification process within the biomaterial, where pH‐conditioning, driving the biolayer in a metastable state, induces a self‐propagating aggregation of partially misfolded proteins, following single‐affinity binding. This process triggers an electrostatic rearrangement, resulting in the displacement of a charge equivalent to 1.5e per 102 recognition elements. Such findings open new opportunities for reliable SPR‐based biosensing at the physical detection limits, with promising applications in point‐of‐care plasmonic systems.

Utilizing electrostatic forces and dielectric pinning, it achieves controlled, contamination‐free manipulation of nanoscale droplets. The study explores its application in diverse fields, including microfluidics, chemical reactions, and material fabrication, offering a sustainable and highly accurate platform for droplet‐based technologies.








Abstract
The application of physical fields is crucial for droplet generation and manipulation, underpinning technologies like printing, microfluidic biochips, drug delivery, and flexible sensors. Despite advancements, precise micro/nanoscale droplet generation and accurate microfluidic reactions remain challenging. Inspired by the liquid ejection mechanisms in microscopic organisms, an electrostatic manipulator for the precise capture, emission, and transport of microdroplets is proposed. This approach enables the controlled and periodic emission of nanoscale daughter droplets from microscale parent droplets, achieved through dielectric pinning on surfaces and electrostatic field‐driven forces. Results show precise nanoscale droplet release on inert polymer surfaces, enabling directional, contamination‐free liquid manipulation. Moreover, leveraging surface treatment techniques and robust electrostatic force‐driven transportation, a versatile strategy for droplet generation and manipulation, spanning from microfluidic devices to chemical reaction operations. The novel droplet manipulation phenomena and control strategies can advance the fields of electrostatic‐based microfluidics, materials fabrication, and beyond.

Ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus, perovskite film demonstrates more oriented packing during the blade‐coating process. The regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94 cm2.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next‐generation photovoltaic technologies. However, perovskite films deposited by blade‐coating usually exhibit inferior film morphology compared to those fabricated by spin‐coating, which hinders the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of the scalable perovskite solar modules (PSMs). Herein, ellipsoidal colloids are tailored in the perovskite precursor solution by incorporating perovskite colloids and polymer additives. Compared to unregulated spherical colloids, the ellipsoidal colloids demonstrate more oriented packing during the blade‐coating process, which is due to the anisotropic driven force from the fluidic flow in the meniscus. As a result of the improved film morphology, the regulated PSCs and PSMs achieve superior PCE of 24.31% and 21.67% (21.37% certified), respectively, for aperture areas of 0.09 and 13.94 cm2, and 89% initial PCE after 600 h continuous operation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Tailored transformation of high‐spin Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) into low‐spin Ni3+ (t2g6eg1) by introducing oxygen vacancies (Ov) can enhance reduction/adsorption of NO3‒→*NO and subsequent protonation to generate *NH2 intermediate, which in situ acts as a localized proton donor to promote *CO2→*COOH on adjacent Ce3+–O site for generating *CO intermediate, following by cross‐coupling of the reduced C‐/N‐intermediates to achieve efficient urea electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The co‐electrolysis of CO2 and NO3− to synthesize urea has become an effective pathway to alternate the conventional Bosch‐Meiser process, while the complexity of C‐/N‐containing intermediates for C−N coupling results in the urea electrosynthesis of unsatisfactory efficiency. In this work, an electronic spin state modulation maneuver with oxygen vacancies (Ov) is unveiled to effectively meliorate the oriented generation of key intermediates *NH2 and *CO for C−N coupling, furnishing urea in ultrahigh yield of 2175.47 µg mg−1 h−1 and Faraday efficiency of 70.1%. Mechanistic studies expound that Ov can induce the conversion of the high‐spin state Ni2+ (t2g6eg2) of Ni@CeO2−x to the low‐spin state Ni3+ (t2g6eg1), which markedly enhances the hybridization degree of the Ni 3d and the N 2p orbitals of *NO, facilitating the selective formation of *NH2. Notably, the in situ generated *NH2 intermediates can serve as a localized proton donor to promote the electroreduction of CO2 on the adjacent site Ce3+−O to exclusively afford *CO, followed by C−N coupling of each other to efficiently synthesize urea. The strategy of tailored switching of the active site spin state provides a reliable reference to rectify the electronic structure of electrocatalysts for directional CO2 valorization.

The dual delivery system employing extracellular vesicles to mediate the co‐delivery of mRNA and nanozymes exhibits synergistic effects on endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial injury, and their functional crosstalk. This system is capable of regulating microglia function from many aspects, including inhibiting NF‐κB signaling pathway, inhibiting microglia overactivation, and promoting microglia M2 polarization, and ultimately ameliorates depressive behaviors.









Abstract
The development of new non‐neurotransmitter drugs is an important supplement to the clinical treatment of major depressive disorder. The latest development of mRNA therapy provides the possibility for the treatment of some major diseases. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria constitute a highly interconnected set of fundamental organelles within cells. The interconnection between them forms specific microdomains that play pivotal roles in calcium signaling, mitochondrial dynamics, inflammation, and autophagy. Perturbations in ER‐mitochondrial connections may contribute to the progression of neurological disorders and other diseases. Herein, an extracellular vesicles‐based delivery system, grounded in mRNA gene therapy and integrated with nanomedicine technology is devised. This system is engineered to traverse the blood–brain barrier and specifically target the central nervous system (CNS), facilitating the simultaneous delivery of mRNA drugs and metallic nanozymes into the brain. This dual‐pronged approach, targeting ER and mitochondrial crosstalk, inhibits microglial overactivation, promotes M2 polarization of microglia, and suppresses the NF‐κB signaling pathway. Consequently, it significantly alleviates Lipopolysaccharides‐induced neuroinflammatory responses and ameliorates anxiety‐ and depression‐like behaviors. This study demonstrates a novel antidepressant therapeutic strategy and establishes a new paradigm for mRNA gene therapy in CNS diseases.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Electrochemical biomass conversion offers a sustainable alternative to conventional chemical processes. This study introduces a novel acid‐induced in situ surface reconstruction strategy on metal foams, enabling efficient biomass transformation. The approach is versatile, adaptable across metals and acids, and provides a scalable platform for green chemistry, demonstrating significant potential for advancing resource recycling and sustainable industrial applications.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic biomass conversion offers a sustainable route for producing organic chemicals, with electrode design being critical to determining reaction rate and selectivity. Herein, a prediction‐synthesis‐validation approach is developed to obtain electrodes for precise biomass conversion, where the coexistence of multiple metal valence states leads to excellent electrocatalytic performance due to the activated redox cycle. This promising integrated foam electrode is developed via acid‐induced surface reconstruction to in situ generate highly active metal (oxy)hydroxide or oxide (MOxHy or MOx) species on inert foam electrodes, facilitating the electrooxidation of 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural (5‐HMF) to 2,5‐furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Taking nickel foam electrode as an example, the resulting NiOxHy/Ni catalyst, featuring the coexistence of multivalent states of Ni, exhibits remarkable activity and stability with a FDCA yields over 95% and a Faradaic efficiency of 99%. In situ Raman spectroscopy and theoretical analysis reveal an Ni(OH)2/NiOOH‐mediated indirect pathway, with the chemical oxidation of 5‐HMF as the rate‐limiting step. Furthermore, this in situ surface reconstruction approach can be extended to various metal foams (Fe, Cu, FeNi, and NiMo), offering a mild, scalable, and cost‐effective method for preparing potent foam catalysts. This approach promotes a circular economy by enabling more efficient biomass conversion processes, providing a versatile and impactful tool in the field of sustainable catalysis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An innovative, lobster tail‐inspired triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG‐SPA) is introduced, featuring self‐powered sensing capabilities. Leveraging these features, a smart TENG‐SPA‐enabled hand rehabilitation robot is developed, showing great promise in replacing the traditional assessment method—which relies on clinicians for manual stretching, subjective resistance evaluation, and experience‐based scoring—thereby driving the transformation from traditional rehabilitation medicine to modern digital rehabilitation medicine.









Abstract
Quantitative assessment for post‐stroke spasticity remains a significant challenge due to the encountered variable resistance during passive stretching, which can lead to the widely used modified Ashworth scale (MAS) for spasticity assessment depending heavily on rehabilitation physicians. To address these challenges, a high‐force‐output triboelectric soft pneumatic actuator (TENG‐SPA) inspired by a lobster tail is developed. The bioinspired TENG‐SPA can generate approximately 20 N at 0.1 MPa, providing sufficient stretching force for spastic fingers. The anti‐interference, durability, and electrical output characteristics of the TENG‐SPA under varying conditions—such as different air pressures, bending frequencies, and simulated spastic finger stretching—are explored, demonstrating TENG‐SPA's ability to sense resistance during the stretching process. Furthermore, a TENG‐SPA‐enabled hand rehabilitation robot system integrated with the convolutional neural network (CNN) is further developed, which is tested in a clinical trial involving 15 stroke patients. The results have demonstrated that a classification accuracy for the levels of finger spasticity reaches 93.3% and the MAS scores predicted by the CNN regression model exhibit a strong linear relationship with the actual MAS (R2 = 0.8451, p < 0.01). This study presents promising potential applications in digital rehabilitation medicine, human–machine interaction, biomedicine, and related fields.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study presents the development of 3D‐printed anisotropic InterPore microfibrous lattices for engineering aligned and densely populated cardiac muscle bundles. By promoting cardiomyocyte alignment and facilitating cell‐mediated remodeling in these lattices, the approach improves high‐density tissue organization, enhances electrophysiological function, and supports the maturation of cardiac tissues.








Abstract
Replicating the structural and functional features of native myocardium, particularly its high‐density cellular alignment and efficient electrical connectivity, is essential for engineering functional cardiac tissues. Here, novel electrohydrodynamically printed InterPore microfibrous lattices with anisotropic architectures are introduced to promote high‐density cellular alignment and enhanced tissue interconnectivity. The interconnected pores in the microfibrous lattice enable dynamic, cell‐mediated remodeling of fibrous hydrogels, resulting in continuous, mechanically stable tissue bundles. Compared to lattices with isolated pores, the engineered aligned cardiac tissues from neonatal rat cardiomyocytes exhibit improved electrophysiological properties and synchronous contractions. Using a multiseeding strategy, an equivalent cell seeding density of 8 × 107 cells mL−1, facilitating the formation of multicellular, vascularized cardiac structures with maintained tissue viability and integrity, is achieved. As a demonstration, human‐induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived cardiac tissues are engineered with progressive maturation and functional integration over time. These findings underscore the potential of InterPore microfibrous lattices for applications in cardiac tissue engineering, drug discovery, and therapeutic development.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Methanol (MeOH) is introduced as a fluid balance agent to regulate Marangoni convection, thereby mitigating disordered colloidal particle motion. As a result, record power conversion efficiencies of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small‐area FAPbI3 devices (0.07 cm2) and large‐area modules (21 cm2), respectively.








Abstract
Laboratory‐scale spin‐coating techniques are widely employed for fabricating small‐size, high‐efficiency perovskite solar cells. However, achieving large‐area, high‐uniformity perovskite films and thus high‐efficiency solar cell devices remain challenging due to the complex fluid dynamics and drying behaviors of perovskite precursor solutions during large‐area fabrication processes. In this work, a high‐quality, pinhole‐free, large‐area FAPbI3 perovskite film is successfully obtained via scalable blade‐coating technology, assisted by a novel bidirectional Marangoni convection strategy. By incorporating methanol (MeOH) as a fluid balance agent, the direction of Marangoni convection is effectively regulated, mitigating the disordered motion of colloidal precursor particles during the printing process. As a result, champion power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.45% and 20.32% are achieved for small‐area FAPbI3 devices (0.07 cm2) and large‐area modules (21 cm2), respectively. Notably, under steady illumination, the device reached a stabilized PCE of 24.28%. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device exhibited remarkable operational stability, retaining 92.03% of its initial PCE after 1800 h under ambient conditions (35 ± 5% relative humidity, 30 °C). To demonstrate the universality of this strategy, a blue perovskite light‐emitting diode is fabricated, showing an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 14.78% and an electroluminescence wavelength (EL) of 494 nm. This work provides a significant technique for advancing solution‐processed, industrial‐scale production of high‐quality and stable perovskite films and solar cells.

<title>Sole‐Solvent High‐Entropy Electrolyte Realizes Wide‐Temperature and High‐Voltage Practical Anode‐Free Sodium Pouch Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A sole‐solvent high‐entropy electrolyte is capable of forming stable anion‐derived electrode–electrolyte interphases, extending the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, high‐voltage anode‐free sodium batteries with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (−20–60 °C) are realized. Furthermore, Ah‐level pouch cell delivers a leadingly high energy density (209 Wh kg−1) and a high capacity retention (83.1%) after 100 cycles at 25 °C.








Abstract
Anode‐free sodium batteries (AFSBs) hold great promise for high‐density energy storage. However, high‐voltage AFSBs, especially those can stably cycle at a wide temperature range are challenging due to the poor electrolyte compatibility toward both the cathode and anode. Herein, high‐voltage AFSBs with cycling ability in a wide temperature range (−20–60 °C) are realized for the first time via a sole‐solvent high‐entropy electrolyte based on the diethylene glycol dibutyl ether solvent (D2) and NaPF6 salt. The sole‐solvent high‐entropy electrolyte with unique solvent‐ions effect of strong anion interaction and weak cation solvation enables entropy‐driven electrolyte salt disassociation and high‐concentration contact ion pairs, thus simultaneously forming stable anion‐derived electrode–electrolyte interphases on cathode and anode. Moreover, the wide liquid range of D2 further extends the temperature extremes of the battery. Consequently, ampere‐hour (Ah)‐level anode‐free sodium pouch cells with cyclability in a wide temperature range of −20–60 °C are realized. Impressively, the pouch cell achieves a leadingly high cell‐level energy density of 209 Wh kg−1 and a high capacity retention of 83.1% after 100 cycles at 25 °C. This work provides inspirations for designing advanced electrolytes for practical AFSBs.

<title>U‐Shaped Dimeric Acceptors for Balancing Efficiency and Stability in Organic Solar Cells</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
U‐shaped dimeric acceptors, 5‐IDT and 6‐IDT, are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component. The efficiencies of 6‐IDT– and 5‐IDT‐treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively. Moreover, the smaller molecular length of 5‐IDT can well stabilize the phase‐separated morphology of the active layer, thereby significantly improving the thermal stability.








Abstract
Despite significant improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs), achieving excellent stability remains a great challenge to their commercial feasibility. Here, U‐shaped dimeric acceptors (5‐IDT and 6‐IDT) with different molecular lengths are introduced into the binary OSCs as a third component, respectively. The introduction of the third component effectively reduces the energetic disorder and non‐radiative voltage losses and improves the exciton dissociation and charge transport of the devices. Consequently, the PCEs of the 6‐IDT‐ and 5‐IDT‐treated OSCs are significantly improved to 19.32% and 19.96%, respectively, which is the highest PCE for oligomeric acceptors‐based ternary OSCs to date. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the treated devices is dramatically improved, with the initial efficiency retention of the 6‐IDT‐ and 5‐IDT‐treated devices increasing from 18% to 32% and 75%, respectively, after 1000 h of thermal stress. This is mainly attributed to the ability of the smaller molecular length of 5‐IDT to stabilize the phase‐separated morphology of the polymeric donor and small molecular acceptor, rather than the high glass transition temperature and low diffusion coefficient.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The dewatering difficulty of nanocellulose dispersion has long been a major challenge hindering its practical utilization. Here, through a supramolecular scale hydrophilicity regulation, the water retention value is substantially decreased and efficient dewatering of cellulose nanofibers (CNF) dispersion is realized, enabling the fabrication of highly dense, strong, fire‐retardant, and moldable CNF bulk materials as sustainable plastic substitutes.








Abstract
Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are ideal building blocks for creating lightweight and strong bulk structural materials due to their unique supramolecular structure and exceptional mechanical properties within the crystalline regions. However, assembling CNFs into dense bulk structural materials with customizable shape and functionalities remains a great challenge, hindering their practical applications. Here, the dewatering issue of aqueous CNF dispersions is addressed by regulating supramolecular scale hydrophilicity using lactic acid, combined with hot‐press molding. This approach enables the fabrication of transparent CNF bulk structural materials with a density of up to 1.426 g cm−3. The mechanical properties, including isotropic in‐plane tensile strength (75.5 ± 4.5 MPa), flexural strength (198 ± 20 MPa), and hardness (≈300 MPa), surpass most engineering plastics. Moreover, unlike conventional CNF based materials, the CNF bulk structural materials exhibit remarkable water stability and flame retardancy. These unique advantages open a new avenue to bottom‐up assembly of CNFs into high‐performance multifunctional eco‐friendly structural materials, dedicating to substitution of plastics and easing the consumption of petrochemical resources.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A multi‐elemental synergy strategy for regulating the local electronic structure is applied to create a broad adsorption energy landscape in high‐entropy alloy catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates in the multi‐step NO3−‐to‐NH3 conversion, effectively overcoming energy‐scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting nitrate (NO3−) to value‐added ammonia (NH3) is a complex process involving an eight‐electron transfer and numerous intermediates, presenting a significant challenge for optimization. A multi‐elemental synergy strategy to regulate the local electronic structure at the atomic level is proposed, creating a broad adsorption energy landscape in high‐entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts. This approach enables optimal adsorption and desorption of various intermediates, effectively overcoming energy‐scaling limitations for efficient NH3 electrosynthesis. The HEA catalyst achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.5 ± 4.3% and a yield rate of 10.2 ± 0.5 mg h−1 mgcat−1. It also demonstrated remarkable stability over 250 h in an integrated three‐chamber device, coupling electrocatalysis with an ammonia recovery unit for continuous NH3 collection. This work elucidates the catalytic mechanisms of multi‐functional HEA systems and offers new perspectives for optimizing multi‐step reactions by circumventing adsorption‐energy scaling limitations.

<title>Development of Marine‐Degradable Poly(Ester Amide)s with Strong, Up‐Scalable, and Up‐Cyclable Performance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A novel method for fabricating poly(ester amide)s combines the benefits of biodegradable polyesters and strong polyamides. These materials, made from upcycled monomers, form films, and yarns with a tensile strength of 109 MPa, tenacity of 5.0 g de−1, and withstand ironing temperatures. They achieve 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months and have a low environmental impact.








Abstract
Biodegradable polyesters provide an attractive alternative to non‐degradable plastics but often encounter a tradeoff between biodegradability and mechanical properties because esters are rotational and lack hydrogen bonds. Conversely, natural polyamides, i.e., silk exhibit excellent mechanical strength because amides are non‐rotational and form hydrogen bonds. Unlike esters, the nitrogen in amides can enhance microbial biodegradation. However, protein engineering exhibits limited productivity, and artificial polyamides, i.e., nylon remain non‐degradable due to their hydrophobic nature. Herein, a method is proposed for developing poly(ester amide)s (PEA)s, a polyester and polyamide hybrid, to address prevailing production challenges. These materials are synthesized from upcycled monomers in a 10 L reactor and converted into films and yarns. They achieve a tensile strength of 109 MPa and tenacity of 5.0 g de−1, while withstanding ironing temperatures. They achieve a remarkable 92% marine biodegradability in 12 months, which is rarely attained by current bioplastics, and exhibit low environmental impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. While biodegradable polyesters have remained within the performance range of commodity plastics, PEAs fall into the high‐performance category, potentially reaching markets that existing biodegradable plastics have not, such as fishing lines and clothing.

<title>Surface Modification of 3D Biomimetic Shark Denticle Structures for Drag Reduction</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Biomimetic shark denticles with alternating superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions are fabricated through 3D printing. Superhydrophobic and partially superhydrophobic denticles exhibit superior drag reduction performance compared to superhydrophilic ones by minimizing vortex formation, presenting a novel approach to the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimal drag reduction.








Abstract
Shark skin features superhydrophilic and riblet‐textured denticles that provide drag reduction, antifouling, and mechanical protection. The artificial riblet structures exhibit drag reduction capabilities in turbulent flow. However, the effects of the surface wettability of shark denticles and the cavity region underneath the denticle crown on drag reduction remain insufficiently explored. Here, 3D printing is utilized to fabricate realistic staggered and overlapped denticle arrays, modified to achieve superhydrophilic, superhydrophobic, and hybrid configurations, including external riblets hydrophilic/internal cavities hydrophobic (ELIB), and vice versa (EBIL). Denticles of varying heights are also fabricated. The results indicate that superhydrophobic, ELIB, and EBIL denticles outperform superhydrophilic ones in reducing drag, achieving a peak drag reduction rate of ≈20%. Notably, shorter denticles further improve drag reduction. Reduced vortex formation within the underneath cavity correlates with improved drag reduction. These vortices can function similarly to rolling bearings while facilitating momentum exchange and increasing skin friction drag. Superhydrophobic or partially superhydrophobic denticles (ELIBD/EBILD) mitigate this effect. This study suggests that sharks may secrete mucus on specific sections of their denticles to further reduce vorticity and drag, offering novel insights into the biomimetic design of shark denticles for optimized drag reduction.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By adjusting the size of tungsten oxide cluster through carbon defects, sub‐nanoclusters are applied to electrocatalytic C─N coupling for amino acid synthesis. Unlike nanoclusters, sub‐nanoclusters facilitate potential tuning to optimize hydroxylamine yield, enabling the production of diverse amino acids with α‐keto acids. This study offers an innovative perspective for catalyst design in high‐value electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate‐rich wastewater and biomass‐derived blocks into high‐value products using renewably generated electricity is a promising approach to modulate the artificial carbon and nitrogen cycle. Here, a new synthetic strategy of WOx sub‐nanoclusters is reported and supported on carbon materials as novel efficient electrocatalysts for nitrate reduction and its coupling with α‐keto acids. In acidic solutions, the NH3‐NH2OH selectivity can also optimized by adjusting the potential, with the total FE exceeding 80% over a wide potential range. After introducing α‐keto acids, the WOx/D‐CB electrode achieves remarkable activity and selectivity toward C2‐C6 amino acids. For glycine and alanine, impressive FEs of 49.34% and 38.22% based on transitional metal oxides can be obtained, surpassing those of WOx nanoclusters with larger size. In situ analysis and mechanistic studies reveal the critical role of WOx sub‐nanoclusters in reducing the energy barriers of key steps in alanine synthesis. This work opens up new insights into the rational design of cluster catalysts to promote electrochemical amino acid synthesis.

<title>Hydration Induces Dehydration: Creating Negative Swelling Gel by a Paradox</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Negative swelling of hydrogel is achieved via a paradoxical hydration‐induced‐dehydration pathway. Chemically crosslinked polymer network generates considerable hydrostatic pressure upon swelling, which forces transformable polymers to self‐assemble and collapse. The as‐fabricated gels can lose 35% weight underwater and exhibit water‐strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn‐off effect, which significantly broadened potential applications.









Abstract
Swelling positively in water is a common behavior of hydrogels, which, however, can lead to reduced mechanical performance and stability. Enabling negative swelling represents a promising way to address those issues but is extremely challenging to realize. Here, real negative swelling hydrogels are successfully prepared for the first time through a unique molecular architecture. Specifically designed interpenetrating transformable‐rigid polymer network undergoes self‐assembly and collapses upon hydration, which in turn dehydrates itself. This paradoxical hydration‐induced‐dehydration process brings about revolutionary outcomes. Gels can now lose up to 35% weight underwater and exhibit water‐strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn‐off effect. Those unique properties allow future material development and applications to be carried out in much broader dimensions.

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have gained significant attention for ability to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. As the applications of TENG devices expand, their safety and reliability becomes priority, particularly where there is risk of fire or spontaneous combustion. Flame‐retardant materials can be employed to address these safety concerns without compromising the performance and efficiency of TENGs. The primary focus of this review is on flame‐retardant materials, including polymers, biomaterials, liquid polymers, aerogels, and carbon‐based materials. The fundamental properties of these materials for TENG applications are elucidated. The characteristics of each material type are described, along with their potential to boost the safety and performance of TENGs. The importance of flame retardancy in advancing TENG technology can be projected from its usage in wearable electronics, self‐powered sensors, and smart textiles. Current challenges such as material compatibility, fabrication complexity, and environmental concerns are addressed, along with proposed strategies for overcoming them. This review underscores the significance of flame‐retardant materials in strengthening the functionality and safety of TENG devices, paving the way for their widespread adoption across various industries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Atomically dispersed Pt anchored in oxygen‐deficient NiFe‐LDH via Pt─Ni bonds reduces Pt's valence state, enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Oxygen vacancies facilitate electron transfer, while elevated Ni valence boosts hydrophilicity and lowers hydrolysis barriers. The catalyst achieves ultra‐low overpotentials and significantly higher mass activity compared to Pt/C, showcasing a novel coordination design strategy.








Abstract
The unique hydrogen adsorption characteristics of negatively charged platinum play a crucial role in enhancing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. However, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are typically anchored to the support through non‐metallic atom bonds, resulting in a high oxidation state. Here, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are anchored in oxygen‐deficient NiFe‐LDH. Electron transfer between Pt and NiFe‐LDH occurs primarily through Pt─Ni bonds rather than the conventional Pt─O bonds. Oxygen vacancies in the NiFe‐LDH promote additional electron transfer from Ni to Pt, thereby reducing the valence state of Pt and enhancing hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, the elevated valence state of Ni increases the catalyst's hydrophilicity and reduces the energy barrier for hydrolysis dissociation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, a novel inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel electrolyte is prepared via in situ sol‐gel polymerization. A high ion conductivity is achieved even under a lean‐water condition. Abundant polar functional groupstend to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thereby reducing the hydrogen evolution reaction. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits excellent performance in both symmetrical Al batteries and full batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) offer a promising avenue for achieving safe, high‐energy, and low‐cost large‐scale energy storage applications. However, the practical development of AAIBs is hindered by competitive reduction reactions in the aqueous solution, which lead to insufficient aluminum (Al) deposition and a severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HRE). In this work, an inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel with a stable silicon‐based network and multiple polar sites is successfully fabricated via an in situ sol‐gel polymerization method. The preferential formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar functional groups and water molecules effectively reduces the thermodynamic reactivity of water. Furthermore, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF‐SIMS) analyses confirm the formation of a stable, inorganic‐rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which kinetically suppresses undesirable side reactions. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 2.9 × 10−3 S cm−1 at 25 °C, even under lean‐water conditions. As a result, Al|hydrogel|potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate (KNHCF) full cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 74.9 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and achieving an outstanding capacity retention of 90.0% after 200 cycles. Additionally, pouch cells exhibit stable open‐circuit voltage under various mechanical abuse conditions.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Critical ingredients can revitalize magnesium‐metal anode in conventional electrolytes. Mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on Mg‐ion solvation structure regulation, interfacial evolution, solvent ionization, and weak interfacial passivation, have been especially underscored in terms of the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly‐passivated interphase properties.









Abstract
Multivalent‐metal batteries hold tremendous promise in solving safety and sustainability problems encountered by common lithium‐ion batteries, but the lack of ideal electrolyte solutions restricts their large‐scale adoption. Tuning electrolyte structures with functional ingredients, especially amines/methoxy‐based amines and phosphates, can revitalize multivalent‐metal anodes and high‐voltage cathodes in conventional electrolytes, unlocking their full potential. However, a rational and clear understanding of the implications of these ingredients, notwithstanding critically important to commercially available electrolyte design, has not been widely accepted. This concise perspective aims to provide timely analysis and discussion on ingredients’ functionalities of solvation shell speciation, interphase evolution, and consequently metal plating/stripping kinetics acceleration. In addition to prevailing coordination interactions, fresh understandings of intermolecular ionization/association and unique interphase formation are underscored by the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly passivated interphase properties. The existing understandings and proposed outlooks are expected to promote the next breakthroughs for rechargeable multivalent‐metal batteries.

<title>Xantphos–Cu‐Decorated Covalent Organic Frameworks for C─H Arylation through Sensitized Electron Transfer</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The incorporation of a tetrahedral Cu(I) single site into the bipyridine‐based covalent organic framework (COF) is shown to effectively drive photocatalytic carbon–carbon bond formation through simultaneous energy and electron transfer pathways. The COF‐based photocatalyst demonstrates efficient and durable performance for the preparation of a series of oxindole and isoindolinones.








Abstract
The isoindolinone scaffold is an important structural motif found in a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic biologically active compounds. However, the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives typically requires multi‐step procedures or the use of palladium‐based catalysts, which are often hampered by low reaction yields and high costs. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs)—emerging crystalline and porous materials—have gained considerable attention for their applications in various organic transformations, particularly in C─H functionalization, cross‐coupling and redox reactions. Although COFs have been extensively studied for photocatalysis, the development of sustainable heterogeneous catalysts using low‐cost transition metal‐based photosensitizers is still in its early stages. Herein, a strategy is presented to incorporate a copper‐Xantphos complex with a tetrahedral Cu(I) geometry into a crystalline and porous COF matrix. This modification enables unprecedented simultaneous electron and energy transfer efficiency during photocatalysis. The Cu–Xantphos coordinated COF exhibits potent photocatalytic activity for the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives via C─Br and C─H bond cleavage followed by C─C bond formation. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent recyclability as it can be rejuvenated by reintroducing the Cu–Xantphos complex after multiple photocatalytic cycles—highlighting its potential as a sustainable and cost‐effective solution for valuable organic transformations.

<title>Frozen by Heating: Temperature Controlled Dynamic States in Droplet Microswimmers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
In the design of smart materials based on active agents or microswimmers, the gaits or motile states of the agents are to be controlled, preferably by external parameters that do not require modifying the composition of the system. A facile, universal parameter is temperature. Here, in the experimental model system of self‐propelling active emulsions, a temperature sensitive mixture of co‐surfactants is used as fuel for propulsion. It is demonstrated that three distinct states of reorienting, then straight motion, and subsequent arrest, can be accessed, counterintuitively, with increasing temperature.








Abstract
Self‐propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, an experimental system of self‐propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states is presented, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the Péclet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which can now be tuned by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. The droplet dynamics are quantified by analyzing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self‐propelled motility, is experimentally demonstrated.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Colored radiative cooling (CRC) has become a prevailing technology for achieving colorful appearance and simultaneously enhancing the effective solar reflectance of cooling coatings. This review presents recent advancements in CRC and its profound impact on energy savings in real‐world applications. After introducing the fundamentals of CRC and color characterization methods, it reviews CRC coloration approaches, including photonic structural colors, complementary color absorption and Purcell‐enhanced fluorescent colors. The review concludes with self‐adaptive CRC materials featuring dynamic optical modulation and their potentially practical applications as well as critical challenges.









Abstract
Radiative cooling technology is gaining prominence as a sustainable solution for improving thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption associated with cooling demands. To meet diverse functional requirements such as aesthetics, switchable cooling, camouflage, and colored smart windows, color is often preferred over a white opaque appearance in the design of radiative cooling materials. Colored radiative cooling (CRC) has emerged as a prevailing technology not only for achieving a colorful appearance but also for increasing the effective solar reflectance to enhance cooling performance (through the incorporation of fluorescent materials). This paper reviews recent advancements in CRC and its profound impact on energy savings and real‐world applications. After introducing the fundamentals of CRC and color characterization, various photonic approaches are explored that leverage resonant structures to achieve coloration in radiative cooling, comparing them with conventional coloration methods based on optical materials like fluorescent pigments that can convert absorbed ultraviolet light into visible‐light emission. Furthermore, the review delves into self‐adaptive CRC materials featuring dynamic optical modulation that responds to temperature fluctuations. Lastly, the potential application of CRC materials is assessed, a comprehensive outlook on their future development is offered, and the critical challenges in practical applications are discussed.

Abstract
Electrocatalysts can efficiently convert earth‐abundant simple molecules into high‐value‐added products. In this context, heterostructures, which are largely determined by the interface, have emerged as a pivotal architecture for enhancing the activity of electrocatalysts. In this review, the atomistic understanding of heterostructured electrocatalysts is considered, focusing on the reaction kinetic rate and electron configuration, gained from both empirical studies and theoretical models. We start from the fundamentals of the microkinetic model, adsorption energy theory, and electric double layer model. The importance of heterostructures to accelerate electrochemical processes via modulating electron configuration and interfacial reactive microenvironment is highlighted, by considering rectification, space charge region, built‐in electric field, synergistic interactions, lattice strain, and geometric effect. We conclude this review by summarizing the challenges and perspectives in the field of heterostructured electrocatalysts, such as the determination of transition state energy, their dynamic evolution, refinement of the theoretical approaches, and the use of machine learning.

<title>Towards Stable Metal–I2 Battery: Design of Iodine–Containing Functional Groups for Enhanced Halogen Bond</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A halogen bond (XB)‐enhanced strategy is proposed, where ─B(OH)I3 groups are incorporated into a highly integrated porous carbon/I2 cathode (HOCF–BIn) to extend interactions between ─B(OH)I3 and subsequent I2 molecules. The strong intermolecular forces in HOCF–BIn cathodes significantly enhance I2/I3−/I− confinement, enabling exceptional cycling stability at I2 loadings of 1.8–6.2 mg cm−2.








Abstract
The redox chemistries of iodine have attracted tremendous attention for charge storage owing to their high theoretical specific capacity and natural abundance. However, the practical capacity and cycle life are greatly limited by the active mass loss originating from the dissolved iodine species in either non‐aqueous or aqueous batteries. Despite intensive progress in physical and physicochemical confinements of iodine species (I2/I3−/I−), less attention has been paid to confining iodine species beyond the host–iodine interface, inhibiting further development of iodine cathodes with high I2 contents. Here a halogen bond (XB)– enhanced design concept is proposed between I2 molecules to achieve stable cycling performances, as exemplified by the Na–I2 battery. The enhanced XB is derived from the incorporation of –B(OH)I3 groups in highly integrated porous carbon/I2 cathode (HOCF–BIn), which can generate extended interactions between –B(OH)I3 and following I2 molecules. Due to the strong intermolecular force between I2 molecules, the HOCF–BIn cathodes exhibit substantially strengthened I2/I3−/I− confinement, enabling outstanding cycling stability at I2 loading ranging from 1.8 to 6.2 mg cm−2. This findings demonstrate a functional group to manipulate XB chemistry within I2 molecules and polyiodides for stable and low‐cost metal–iodine batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
The nanoplatform based on engineered attenuated OMVs has good biosafety and can cross the BBB and target GBM with the assistance of Angiopep‐2. The co‐delivery of doxorubicin and CD47‐siRNA and the immunogenicity of OMVs synergistically overcome the intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance of GBM, which ultimately triggers a powerful antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Apart from the blood‐brain barrier (BBB), the efficacy of immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) is limited by the presence of intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance, implying that co‐delivery of various immunotherapeutic agents or simultaneous regulation of different cells is urgently needed. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) offer a unique advantage in the treatment of GBM, owing to their multifunctional properties as carriers and immune adjuvants and their ability to cross the BBB. However, traditional OMVs can lead to toxic side effects and disruption of tight junctions in the BBB. Therefore, to enhance the in vivo safety and targeting capability of OMVs, we introduced engineered OMVs to reduce toxicity and further constructed a modularly assembled nanoplatform by performing simple peptide modifications. This nanoplatform demonstrates satisfactory biosafety and is able to continuously cross the BBB and target GBM with the assistance of Angiopep‐2. Subsequently, immunogenic substances on OMVs, along with carried small‐interfering RNA (siRNA) and doxorubicin, can promote and enhance the reprogramming and phagocytic abilities of macrophages and microglia, respectively, and increase the immunogenicity of GBM, ultimately overcoming GBM immune resistance to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. This OMVs‐based nanoplatform provides a new paradigm and insights into the development of immunotherapy for GBM.

This review probes recent advancements in PEMWEs for green hydrogen production from the perspective of acidic OER, identifies challenges related to corrosive environments and oxidative conditions, and proposes strategies to enhance the long‐term stability of PEMWEs by addressing both catalyst and membrane electrode assembly deactivation.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) represents a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production. However, the large‐scale commercialization of PEMWE faces challenges due to the need for acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with long‐term stability and corrosion‐resistant membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). This review thoroughly examines the deactivation mechanisms of acidic OER and crucial factors affecting assembly instability in complex reaction environments, including catalyst degradation, dynamic behavior at the MEA triple‐phase boundary, and equipment failures. Targeted solutions are proposed, including catalyst improvements, optimized MEA designs, and operational strategies. Finally, the review highlights perspectives on strict activity/stability evaluation standards, in situ/operando characteristics, and practical electrolyzer optimization. These insights emphasize the interrelationship between catalysts, MEAs, activity, and stability, offering new guidance for accelerating the commercialization of PEMWE catalysts and systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A sustainable Zn interfacial architecture is established, where a robust polyimide nanofilm is covalently anchored to the Zn substrate through electronegative F atoms. The strong covalent interactions provide excellent interfacial adhesion during repeated Zn/Zn2+ cycling. The remarkable resilience, modulus, and low creep of FPI film effectively resist the impact stress from electroplated Zn while maintaining structural integrity.








Abstract
Artificial interfacial protective coatings (IPCs) on Zn anodes provide a viable solution for suppressing dendritic growth by spatially confining and homogenizing the Zn2+ flux. However, repeated Zn deformation during electroplating/stripping cycles can lead to the rupture or exfoliation of IPCs, as well as the formation of detrimental interfacial gaps. Herein, a highly durable IPC is developed on a Zn substrate using a mechanically robust fluorinated polyimide nanofilm (FPI). This unique FPI interphase forms strong covalent bonds with Zn through electronegative fluorine atoms, facilitating Zn plating/stripping while maintaining interfacial adhesion. The superior resilience, modulus, and low creep of the FPI film resist the impact stresses from electroplated Zn, ensuring structural integrity. With this FPI coating, the FPI‐Cu||Zn half cells demonstrate high reversibility in Zn2+ electroplating/stripping over 4000 h, maintaining Coulombic efficiency above 99.33%. When coupled with a MnO2 cathode, the MnO2||FPI‐Zn full cells exhibit a long lifespan, surpassing 5000 cycles, with a high specific capacity retention of 75.21%. This study highlights the importance of achieving a balance between the customized compatibility and mechanical properties of IPCs to modulate zinc interfacial chemistries.

An infrared‐sensitive image sensor based on self‐welded tellurium (Te) nanomesh is proposed, demonstrating advancements in flexible integration and scalable fabrication. By leveraging the unique photothermolelectric (PTE) operation, thermal‐coupled bi‐directional photoresponse is explored to illustrate the proof‐of‐principle in‐sensor convolutional network for edge computing.








Abstract
The inherent limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures hinder the rapid development of internet of things technologies. Beyond conventional, complementary metal‐oxide‐semiconductor technologies, imaging sensors integrated with near‐ or in‐sensor computing architectures emerge as a promising solution. In this study, the multi‐scale van der Waals (vdWs) interactions in 1D tellurium (Te) atomic chains are explored, leading to the deposition of a photothermoelectric (PTE) Te nanomesh on a polymeric polyimide substrate. The self‐welding process enables the lateral vapor growth of a well‐connected Te nanomesh with robust electrical and mechanical properties, including a PTE responsivity of ≈120 V W−1 in the infrared light regime. Leveraging the PTE operation, the thermal‐coupled bi‐directional photoresponse is investigated to demonstrate a proof‐of‐principle in‐sensor convolutional network for edge computing. This work presents a scalable approach for assembling functional vdWs Te nanomesh and highlights its potential applications in PTE image sensing and convolutional processing.

A D–A–D type TADF molecule, TPA‐DHAQ, is designed and synthesized by introducing an ESIPT‐active molecule DHAQ as the acceptor unit, based on which the NIR TADF laser with a low threshold and high stability is successfully realized. In addition, a single‐mode NIR TADF laser can be realized by adjusting the size of the resonator. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy to overcome the problem of poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers.









Abstract
Near‐infrared (NIR) organic lasers have undergone rapid development in recent years, but still facing challenges in lowering the threshold and improving the stability. Herein, to overcome these challenges, a “two in one” strategy involving the integration of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) activity in a single molecule is proposed. Specifically, a donor–acceptor–donor type TADF material 2,6‐bis[4‐(diphenylamino)phenyl]‐1,5‐dihydroxyanthraquinone (TPA‐DHAQ) with an ESIPT‐active moiety as the acceptor, is designed and synthesized, based on which, a NIR organic laser at 820 nm with an exceptionally low threshold of 6.3 µJ cm−2 can be realized. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the TADF property and the ESIPT process, the resulting organic laser showed excellent stability by maintaining the laser intensity at ≈80% of the initial value after 580 min of continuous excitation. Finally, by modulating the size of the resonator, a single‐mode NIR laser is successfully realized. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy for the development of new TADF gain materials to overcome the problem of high threshold and poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers, and shed light on the future development of NIR organic lasers.

Meter‐scale MXene/GO@monstera nanocellulose core‐shell nanofiber textiles are produced, integrating ultra‐broadband EMI shielding covering GHz and THz bands, super‐strong stealth properties within NIR and MIR ranges, and excellent multifunctionality, including heat resistance, flame retardant, joule heating, and stress sensing capabilities, which are promising for comprehensive electromagnetic defense in both military and civilian fields.








Abstract
The rapid development of wireless communication and infrared (IR) detection technologies has generated an increasing demand for large‐size high‐performance wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and IR stealth textiles. Herein, meter‐scale MXene/graphene oxide (MG)@monstera nanocellulose (MC) core‐shell nanofiber textiles are fabricated for the first time using a multi‐stage cryogenic drying‐assisted coaxial wet spinning assembly strategy, with MG as the conductive composite core and MC as the organic skeleton shell. The highly aligned shell and dense core endow the nanofibers with a great toughness of ≈39.6 MJ m−3, a strong strength >≈180 MPa, and a high conductivity of 6.4 × 103 S m−1. The textiles exhibit unprecedented ultra‐broadband EMI shielding performance covering gigahertz and terahertz bands, with optimal shielding effectiveness up to 84 and 85 dB in the band of 8.2–26.5 GHz and 0.3–1.5 THz, respectively, at only 185 µm thick. Superb IR stealth performance in the near‐ and mid‐IR ranges is also achieved, benefitting from their good heat resistance and low IR emissivity. Furthermore, the textiles also demonstrate excellent dyeability, flame retardancy, Joule heating, and stress‐sensing properties. Such scalable prepared core‐shell nanofiber textiles with superior comprehensive performance have broad application prospects in future smart wearable protective devices.

Novel polyimide‐ionene hybrids that exhibit desirable alcohol processability, conductivity, transparency, and metal/semiconductor interface modification ability are furnished by melding pyromellitic diimides into ionene backbones. These merits render them universal cathode interlayer materials with outstanding thickness tolerance, leading to not only highly efficient and stable opaque devices but also high‐performance semitransparent devices even when pairing with low‐cost Cu electrodes.








Abstract
The contradiction between high transmittance and favorable conductivity poses a great challenge in developing effective cathode interlayer (CIL) materials with sufficient thickness tolerance, which hinders the further advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a completely new class of alcohol processable polyimide‐ionene hybrids (PIIHs) is proposed by melding pyromellitic diimide (PMD) subunits into imidazolium‐based ionenes backbone covalently. These PIIHs, named PMD‐DI and PMD‐PD, boast high transparency, suitable energy levels, and decent conductivity. A higher PMD content endows PMD‐PD with improved work function tunability, electrical properties, and crystallinity, enabling PMD‐PD as CIL material with excellent thickness‐insensitive characteristics, while simultaneously improving device stability significantly. Furthermore, PMD‐PD also exhibits good compatibility with various electrodes and active layers, offering solar cell efficiencies of up to 19.91% and 19.29% with Ag and Cu cathodes, respectively. More importantly, the application of PMD‐PD can improve the performance of semi‐transparent OSCs without losing transmittance, thereby drastically enhancing the light utilization efficiency to 4.04% with an ultrathin, low‐cost Cu cathode, that competes with leading optical modulation‐free semitransparent OSCs with expensive Ag cathodes. This work opens a pathway to realize transparent and conductive interlayers by strategic molecular design, leading to highly efficient, stable, and cost‐effective OSCs suitable for diverse applications.

Biological nanopores are highly promising tools for single‐molecule biosensors, but the fragile supporting lipid membranes is a major bottleneck. An alternative hybrid membrane is presented, comprising phospholipids and block co‐polymers, that can be functionalized by a broad variety of nanopores for single‐molecule sensing. Crucially, the hybrid membrane provides substantially increased stability to harsh conditions, providing new opportunities for nanopore‐based biosensors.








Abstract
Biological nanopores are powerful tools for single‐molecule detection, with promising potential as next‐generation biosensors. A major bottleneck in nanopore analysis is the fragility of the supporting lipid membranes, that easily rupture after exposure to biological samples. Membranes comprising PMOXA‐PDMS‐PMOXA (poly(2‐methyloxazoline‐b‐dimethylsiloxane‐b‐2‐methyloxazoline)) or PBD‐PEO (poly(1,2‐butadiene)‐b‐poly(ethylene oxide)) polymers may form robust alternatives, but their suitability for the reconstitution of a broad range of nanopores has not yet been investigated. Here, PBD‐PEO membranes are found to be highly robust toward applied voltages and human serum, while providing a poor environment for nanopore reconstitution. However, hybrid membranes containing a similar molar ratio of PBD11PEO8 polymers and diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids show the best of both worlds: highly robust membranes suitable for the reconstitution of a wide variety of nanopores. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that lipids form ≈12 nm domains interspersed by a polymer matrix. Nanopores partition into these lipid nanodomains and sequester lipids, possibly offering the same binding strength as in a native bilayer. Nanopores reconstituted in hybrid membranes yield efficient sampling of biomolecules and enable sensing of high concentrations of human serum. This work thus shows that hybrid membranes functionalized with nanopores allow single‐molecule sensing, while forming robust interfaces, resolving an important bottleneck for novel nanopore‐based biosensors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Zinc anodes face severe instability under extreme conditions of high current density, high areal capacity, and high depth of discharge (DOD) due to severe concentration polarization caused by the imbalance between Zn2⁺ consumption and transfer rates. To overcome this, a nanofluid layer is introduced to rapidly absorb Zn2⁺ and regulate interfacial ion transport, effectively mitigating polarization and enabling stable zinc deposition. This work provides key insights into interfacial engineering for next‐generation high‐performance zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The commercialization of zinc metal batteries aims at high‐rate capability and lightweight, which requires zinc anodes working at high current density, high areal capacity, and high depth of discharge. However, frequent zinc anode fades drastically under extreme conditions. Herein, it is revealed that the primary reason for the anode instability is the severe concentration polarization caused by the imbalanced consumption rate and transfer rate of Zn2+ under extreme conditions. Based on this finding, a nanofluid layer is constructed to rapidly absorb Zn2+ and mitigate the polarization induced by the nonlinear transport of interfacial ions. The modified zinc anode sustains at extreme conditions for over 1573 h (40 mA cm−2, 40 mAh cm−2, DOD = 75.97%) and 490 h (100 mA cm−2, 100 mAh cm−2, DOD = 90.91%), and achieving an unprecedented cumulative capacity of 62.92 Ah cm−2. This work offers both fundamental and practical insights for the interface design in energy storage devices.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This review aims to highlight the effect of electrolyte regulation on alleviating issues on the cathode side in aqueous ZIBs. The recent advances of electrolyte regulation strategies are present, with a comprehensive discussion and summary of regulation mechanisms, which can provide guidance to develop novel and multifunctional electrolytes for next‐generation aqueous ZIBs.








Abstract
Enhancing cathodic performance is crucial for aqueous zinc‐ion batteries, with the primary focus of research efforts being the regulation of the intrinsic material structure. Electrolyte regulation is also widely used to improve full‐cell performance, whose main optimization mechanisms have been extensively discussed only in regard to the metallic anode. Considering that ionic transport begins in the electrolyte, the modulation of the electrolyte must influence the cathodic performance or even the reaction mechanism. Despite its importance, the discussion of the optimization effects of electrolyte regulation on the cathode has not garnered the attention it deserves. To fill this gap and raise awareness of the importance of electrolyte regulation on cathodic reaction mechanisms, this review comprehensively combs the underlying mechanisms of the electrolyte regulation strategies and classifies the regulation mechanisms into three main categories according to their commonalities for the first time, which are ion effect, solvating effect, and interfacial modulation effect, revealing the missing puzzle piece of the mechanisms of electrolyte regulation in optimizing the cathode.

This study investigates bias‐induced structural transformations in 1T‐TiSe2 devices, focusing on the transition from the 1T metallic phase to the distorted 1Td phase and ultimately to an orthorhombic Ti9Se2 conducting phase. Using ex‐situ and in‐situ TEM, dynamic structural changes and insights into the effect of thickness on phase transitions, providing valuable information for CDW‐based device applications, are revealed. 









Abstract
Metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (MTMDCs) are of significant attention for various electronic applications due to their anisotropic conductivity, high electron mobility, superconductivity, and charge‐density‐waves (CDW). Understanding the correlations between electronic properties and structural transformations is crucial. In this study, a bias‐induced structural transformation in vertical CDW‐based 1T‐TiSe2 devices, transitioning from a 1T metallic phase to a distorted transition 1Td phase and subsequently to an orthorhombic Ti9Se2 conducting phase, is reported. Using ex‐situ and in‐situ biasing transmission electron microscopy, dynamic structural changes, while electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis revealed valence state modifications in Ti and Se within the Ti‐rich layer after biasing, are observed. In addition, the effect of varying 1T‐TiSe2 thickness on the maximum current value is investigated. These observations reveal that increased thickness requires higher voltage to induce phase transitions. These insights contribute to understanding the structural and electronic dynamics of 1T‐TiSe2, highlighting its potential as a promising material for future CDW‐based device applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Ultra‐small silver nanoparticles are formed in situ and activated in an amidoxime‐modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity to fabricate a metallic nanocomposite membrane for C2H4/C2H6 separation. The activated silver nanoparticles promote C2H4 transport and effectively enhance C2H4/C2H6 separation selectivity, resulting in an outstanding membrane separation performance with C2H4 permeability of 322.1 barrer and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity as high as 8.8.








Abstract
The separation of C2H4 and C2H6 is a critical yet energy‐intensive operation in the petrochemical industry. Gas separation membranes offer energy‐efficient alternatives, but their effectiveness is hindered by the similar physical properties of C2H4 and C2H6. Here, a metallic nanocomposite membrane (MNM) comprising ultra‐small Ag nanoparticles embedded in an amidoxime‐modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (AOPIM‐1) is reported for highly efficient C2H4/C2H6 separation. The microporous structure of AOPIM‐1, combined with anchoring groups (amidoxime groups) inside the microcavities, enables size‐controlled growth of Ag nanoparticles with ‒≈3 nm diameter, which maximizes the contact with ethylene molecules. The amidoxime groups as electron acceptors effectively enrich the positive charge on the surface of Ag nanoparticles. The activated Ag form reversible complexes with ethylene molecules endowing them with preferential affinity over ethane. The resulting Ag nanocomposite membrane demonstrates a ≈10‐fold increase in C2H4 permeability, reaching 322.1 barrer, and a ≈3‐fold increase in C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, reaching 8.8. The comprehensive separation performance is superior over all the polymer membranes and mixed matrix membranes reported so far. The MNMs also demonstrate stable mixed gas separation performance under elevated feed gas pressures. This study provides valuable insights into designing and fabricating polymer membranes with high C2H4/C2H6 separation performance.

A Co single‐atom catalyst (Co‐N₄) enhances Cl₂ adsorption and lowers LiCl reaction barriers in Li‐Cl₂ batteries. The Li‐Cl₂@Co‐NC battery exhibits >600 cycles at 1500 mA g⁻¹ at room temperature and 650 cycles at 500 mA g⁻¹ at −40 °C, with a 0.6 V reduction in polarization voltage. This strategy delivers high‐performance Li‐Cl₂ batteries with wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Lithium‐chlorine (Li‐Cl2) secondary batteries are emerging as promising candidates for high‐energy‐density power sources and an extensive operational temperature range. However, conventional electrode materials suffer from weak adsorption for chlorine gas (Cl2) and low conversion efficiency of lithium chloride (LiCl), leading to significant loss of chlorine‐based active materials. This issue hampers the cyclability of Li‐Cl2 batteries. In this work, it is demonstrated that synergistic Cl2 adsorption on the electrode surface and the energy barrier for LiCl reactions are crucial for enhancing Cl2/LiCl conversion efficiency. Consequently, a cobalt (Co) single‐atom site catalyst with a Co‐N4 coordination environment has been developed, which significantly diminishes the transformation barrier of solid LiCl particles into Cl2 and concurrently enhances the chemical adsorption of Cl2, facilitating uniform nucleation of LiCl. As a result, the Li‐Cl2@Co‐NC battery developed has achieved a 0.6 V reduction in polarization voltage under high current densities, effectively addressing the issue of low conversion efficiency between Cl2 and LiCl. At room temperature, the Li‐Cl2@Co‐NC battery achieves over 600 cycles at 1500 mA g−1; At −40 °C, it reaches 650 cycles at 500 mA g−1. The research overcomes the cycle stability barrier in high‐current Li‐Cl2 batteries and offers a strategy for batteries with a wide temperature range and long cycle life.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An eutectogel (PSDIC‐gel) with exceptional integrative properties is successfully developed by blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, in which spontaneously forming dual ionic channels through in situ polymerization‐induced phase separation. The transparent PSDIC‐gel exhibits remarkable tensile strength, high toughness, excellent ionic conductivity, improved water tolerance, and rapid room temperature self‐healing ability, thus, has wide application prospects in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Eutectogels are emerging as the next‐generation stretchable electronics due to their superior ionic conductivity, non‐volatility, and cost‐effectiveness. Nevertheless, most eutectogels suffer from weak mechanical strength and toughness and pronounced hygroscopicity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to fabricate phase‐separated eutectogels with dual ionic channels (PSDIC‐gel), which exhibit exceptional integrative properties, especially water resistance. By blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, dual ionic channels spontaneously form via polymerization‐induced phase separation. The hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) phase containing Li+‐channels, rich in hydrogen bonding and ion‐dipole interactions, provides mechanical strength and conductivity. The hydrophobic poly(hexafluorobutyl acrylate) (PHFBA) phase incorporating cholinium cation (Ch+) channels enhances toughness, conductivity, and water resistance. Adjusting the phase ratio yields a microphase‐separated transparent eutectogel with high tensile strength (6.03 MPa), toughness (16.18 MJ m−3), excellent ionic conductivity (1.6 × 10−3 S m−1), strong substrate adhesion, and rapid room‐temperature self‐healing. Solid‐state NMR reveals the conductive mechanism and the phase‐separated structure featuring dual ionic channels in PSDIC‐gels, advancing the understanding of complex ionic interactions at the atomic level. The PSDIC‐gel enables a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator for accurate real‐time self‐powered human motion sensing. This work advances eutectogel design through structure‐property engineering, offering a universal strategy to reconcile mechanical robustness, environmental suitability, and ionic conductivity for wearable electronics.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Stereoisomerism engineering plays a crucial role in tailoring the properties of vicinal dichloronorbornene (PDCNB), with profound effects in backbone spacing, π‐stacking, barrier height, and trap states, empowering PDCNB with superior capacitive performance that outperforms existing polymers and nanocomposites in capacitive energy storage at 250 °C.








Abstract
The emergence of high‐density electronics in aerospace and renewable energies demands high temperature dielectrics. Molecular engineering represents a vital strategy for designing dielectric polymers, yet the influence of stereochemistry remains untapped. Herein, by designing halogen substituents of an aromatic pendant attached to a bicyclic mainchain, vicinal polydichloronorbornene (PDCNB) with a high glass‐transition temperature (Tg) of 263 °C is obtained. Further study unveils the profound effect of stereochemistry on the properties of exo‐ and endo‐PDCNB. Both isomers show identical high Tg and bandgap (4.3 eV), imparting PDCNBs with remarkable capacitive energy storage, outperforming existing polymers and nanocomposites with two orders of magnitude lower conduction at an ultra‐high temperature of 250 °C. Moreover, the effect of stereoisomerism is manifested in the differences in backbone spacing, π‐stacking, barrier height, and trap states, and the resulting distinct high field performance. Exo‐PDCNB displays an extremely low conduction of 6.8 × 10−14 S m⁻1 at 200 mV m⁻1 and maintains a record charge‐discharge efficiency of 82% at 450 mV m⁻1, while endo‐PDCNB exhibits a high breakdown strength of 600 mV m⁻1 with a remarkable discharged density of 4.47 J cm⁻3, all at 250 °C. This study unleashes a stereochemistry‐based strategy with vicinal dichloro substitution to further boost the Tg of polynorbornene for ultra‐high‐temperature applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A flexible wearable ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) by integrating a thermosensitive crystallizing agent, and supporting electrolyte into a natural nanocellulose hydrogel matrix is designed and constructed, which exhibits a remarkable thermopower, an optimized effective ionic conductivity, anti‐drying, freezing resistance, and mechanical robustness. This work provides a versatile strategy for developing TGTC, contributing to advancements in low‐grade energy harvesting and wearable electronics for the Internet of Things era.








Abstract
Gel thermocells (GTCs) provide a safe, facile, and scalable solution for harvesting waste heat to power ubiquitous electronics. However, achieving a harmonious integration of high power density, wide‐temperature‐range stability, and mechanical robustness in GTCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, a novel ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) is proposed and fabricated by integrating ferro/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63−/4−) redox couples, thermosensitive crystallizing agents guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), and supporting electrolytes lithium chloride (LiCl) into natural nanocellulose hydrogels to enhance overall performance. GdmCl selectively induces Fe(CN)64− crystallization, increasing the concentration difference of redox pairs, resulting in improving thermopower and significantly increased fiber friction, while LiCl rapidly balances charges through electromigration promoting efficient ion transport and reconstructing hydrogen bond networks, contributing to an excellent output power density and the capture of water molecules, which are further elucidated by simulations, achieving synchronous enhancement of anti‐drying, anti‐freezing and mechanical properties. Consequently, the TGTC achieves a remarkable thermopower of 3.42 mV K−1, a maximum power density of 2.8 mW m−2 K−2, multiple continuous stable cycles at −20 °C, and an impressive strength of 3.06 MPa. Notably, this study elucidates the design principles and underlying mechanisms of ternary gel electrolytes, offering a practical strategy for advancing GTC technology.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Herein, in a bold departure from convention, the Ouzo effect is pioneeringly utilized to design surfactant‐free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE), creating the first application of water‐in‐oil type Möbius polarity topological solvation in zinc‐ion batteries. This approach enables dual regulation of both the solvent environment and the solvation structure, thereby enhancing battery performance.








Abstract
Zinc‐ion batteries (ZIBs) have promising prospects in energy storage field, but the water molecules in aqueous electrolytes significantly compromise the stability of the anode and cathode interfaces and hinder the low‐temperature performance. Herein, water‐in‐oil type Möbius polarity topological solvation composed of oil, water, and amphiphilic salt are first‐ever pioneered, forming the surfactant‐free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE). This water‐in‐oil type Möbius solvation structure, characterized by its distinct inner and outer layers and a polarity inversion feature, successfully connects the non‐polar phase with the polar phase, eliminating the need for surfactants to reduce costs and system complexity. The amphiphilic anion of salt creates a polarity singularity and stabilizes the polarity‐reversed encapsulation. The outer oil layer disrupts the cohesive polarity network of water and constructs a polarity‐reversed cage to restrict water. A series of SFMEE combinations are investigated and then directly applied to ZIBs, confirming excellent universality and durability of this design. The Zn||NVO (NaV₃O₈·1.5H₂O) cells using SFMEE can stably cycle for 4000 cycles with a capacity of 125 mAh g−1 and 86.8% capacity retention. This discovery of Möbius solvation structure unlock unprecedented levels of electrolyte design and illuminate the development of next‐generation high‐performance energy storage systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Interlayer displacement plays a crucial role in tuning properties of layered crystals, yet its precise and efficient determination remains challenging. A deep learning‐based analysis is presented for atomic‐resolution phase‐contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, accurately identifying stacking displacement in bilayer phosphorene with near unit‐cell resolution. The model processes large‐scale in situ TEM data, capturing time‐dependent displacement dynamics linked to edge reconstruction.








Abstract
The interlayer displacement has recently emerged as a crucial tuning parameter to control diverse physical properties in layered crystals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), an exceptionally powerful tool for structural analysis, directly observes the interlayer stacking and strain fields in various crystals. However, conventional analysis methods based on high‐resolution phase‐contrast TEM images are inadequate for recognizing spatially varying unit‐cell patterns and their associated structure factors, hindering precise determination of interlayer displacements. Here, a deep learning‐based analysis is introduced for atomic resolution TEM images, enabling unit‐cell pattern recognition and precise identification of interlayer stacking displacement in bilayer phosphorene. The deep learning model applied to bilayer phosphorene accurately determines stacking displacement, with an error level of 3.3% displacement within the unit cell and a spatial resolution approaching the individual unit‐cell level. Additionally, the model successfully processes a large set of in situ TEM data, capturing spatially varying, time‐dependent interlayer displacement dynamics associated with edge reconstruction, demonstrating its potential for processing large‐scale microscopy datasets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This study introduces an in situ internal encapsulation strategy by integrating cross‐linkable p‐type small molecules into the antisolvent to construct a highly hole‐selective, transparent, and robust passivation contact. The 1.65 eV n–i–p PSC achieves a 19.8% PCE, with better thermal, UV, and operational stabilities, and a bifaciality of 101.4%, alongside a 29.2% certified PCE tandem cell.








Abstract
The optically deficient and intrinsically unstable hole transport layer (HTL) is the Achilles’ heel of n–i–p perovskite/silicon tandems. Here, a minimalist transparent hole‐selective contact is developed without additional HTL by simply integrating cross‐linkable p‐type small molecules into antisolvent. This strategy not only improves the perovskite crystallinity, shields the perovskite from external stressors, and suppresses interfacial mass exchange, but also provides efficient defect passivation and favorable band alignment via the formation of graded heterojunction. Consequently, the corresponding 1.65 eV perovskite solar cell achieves a stabilized efficiency of 19.6%, alongside significantly improved thermal, ultraviolet, and operation stabilities. Furthermore, leveraging its outstanding transparency, a bifacial single‐junction device is showcased achieving a record bifaciality of 101.4%, and a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem boasting a certified efficiency of 29.2% for 1.04 cm2, which represents the highest certified efficiency achieved for n–i–p perovskite/silicon tandems. The demonstration of efficient and stable minimalist hole‐selective contacts encourages the tandem community to reevaluate the n–i–p structure, with the goal of harnessing the high open‐circuit voltage of single‐junction n–i–p PSCs.

A robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of Pyr13TFSI as co‐solvent into the bulk electrolyte. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de‐coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion‐derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics.








Abstract
The decomposition of 1,2‐dimethoxyethane (DME) in localized high‐concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) under high voltage produces fragile and unstable organic fragments at the cathode/electrolyte interphase, which greatly damages the cycling performance of high‐energy‐density lithium metal batteries. Herein, a robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of 1‐Methyl‐1‐propyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr13TFSI) as co‐solvent into the bulk electrolyte to significantly improve the stability of solvated DME through reinforcing the ion‐dipole interaction between TFSI− and DME. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de‐coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion‐derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 coin cells with Pyr13TFSI exhibit capacity retention of 76.1% after 1800 cycles at 1 C rate (4.5 V), and 77.1% after 800 cycles at a high cut‐off voltage of 4.6 V. Furthermore, the cells using Li anode with the thickness of 50 µm and high LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 loading of 18.68 mg cm−2 can operate for 175 cycles with high‐capacity retention of 73.35%. This work demonstrates that modulating the interactions among electrolyte components using ionic liquid can optimize the coordination chemistry for advanced high‐energy density Li metal batteries.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By adopting a bimolecular synergistic passivation strategy, it is feasible to achieve micro‐ and nano‐structural modulation of the perovskite surface, thereby passivating surface defects, regulating interface energy levels, and enhancing the interface electric field. This approach maximizes the reduction of nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface and demonstrates universal applicability across perovskite/C60 interfaces with different bandgaps.








Abstract
Although p‐i‐n type inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve excellent photoelectric efficiencies, the nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface is still the key factor affecting the overall efficiency of p‐i‐n PSCs. Herein, a synergistic passivation strategy (meta‐fluoro‐phenylethylammonium iodide and piperazine iodide) is developed to modify the perovskite/C60 interface in p‐i‐n PSCs. This strategy facilitates in situ reconstruction of the perovskite film to obtain a smooth and flat perovskite surface. Furthermore, the two molecules work synergistically to passivate surface defects, adjust the interface energy levels, and bolster the interface electric field, all of which reduce the nonradiative recombination losses at the perovskite/C60 interface. The optimal PSCs adopting this strategy achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.85%. (certified value of 25.22%). After operating at the maximum power point for 1000 h, the 95% initial efficiency can be maintained. Furthermore, this process is universally applicable and scalable.

This article designs and prepares a photo‐responsive H2S composite nerve transplantation conduit using electrospinning technology and drug delivery system, combining aligned structure, RGD peptide, H2S, and Zn‐CA MOFs. This system can not only achieve artificially controlled H2S release, but also slowly release Zn2+, achieving the joint regulation of Zn2+ and H2S in the nerve regeneration microenvironment.








Abstract
After injury, the imbalance of the regeneration microenvironment caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, insufficient neurovascularization, and inadequate energy supply affects nerve regeneration. Drug‐delivery nerve conduits play a role in repairing the regenerative microenvironment. However, traditional drugs often fail to cross the blood‐nerve barrier and lack multifunctionality, limiting the effectiveness of conduit therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a multifunctional conduit that regulate the regeneration microenvironment timely and effectively. Herein, a photo‐responsive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) composite nerve conduit, artificially controlled H2S release, is developed. A new structure of zinc‐citric acid organic metal framework (Zn‐CA MOFs) is utilized to improve its drug loading rate, achieving the joint regulation of the nerve regeneration microenvironment by H2S and Zn2+. In addition, RGD modification of polyester amide (P(CL‐MMD‐MAC)‐RGD)) combined with aligned structure is used to improve the performance of the conduit. Relevant results demonstrate that H2S and Zn2+ can regulate inflammatory response and oxidative stress and promote mitochondrial function recovery and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the aligned structure can promote cell adhesion and guide cell directed migration. Overall, this study provides a method of combining gas neurotransmitters with ions to improve the nerve regeneration microenvironment, accelerate nerve regeneration, and restore motor function.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Functionalized artificial cellular micromotors are synthesized to achieve phototropic movement under light conditions. The protons released by the light reaction inside the micromotor combine with the natural ATP synthase on the surface to synthesize and release ATP, which slows down the disease process of degenerative knee osteoarthritis to a certain extent.








Abstract
Combining artificial cellular compartmentalization and intelligent motion benefits of micro/nanomotors, light is used as energy input to construct an artificial cell‐based micromotor capable of photosynthetic anabolism and intelligent directional movement. This system is assembled from phospholipids functionalized with F‐ATP synthase and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoparticles (Vesical@MoS2‐ATPase). The underlying mechanism involves the generation of protons (H+) through photo‐hydrolysis of MoS2 nanoparticles within vesicles, which generates a local electroosmotic flow inside the vesicles and drives the negatively charged MoS2 toward light. The established proton gradient across the phospholipid membrane, in turn, drives the ATP synthase to catalyze ATP production. Both in vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that the micromotor can elevate local intracellular ATP levels upon light and improve the metabolism of denatured chondrocytes. This cell mimicry, with capabilities of migration and biosynthesis, emerges as a promising platform for the next generation of functional bio‐interface.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving highly bright and narrowband organic hyperafterglow by isolating conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized luminescence and energy acceptor with multi‐resonance effect into a rigid host. Efficient energy and chirality transfers afford multi‐color hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of≈90%, full‐width at half maxima of 31–39 nm, lifetime of 120–770 ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of≈10−3.








Abstract
Pure room‐temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) promises great advantages in both exciton utilization and lifetime manipulation over existing organic luminophores for a variety of emerging applications, but the low brightness, low efficiency, and low color purity constrain the afterglow luminescence significantly. Here, a promising approach to design highly bright, efficient, and narrowband pRTP with long‐lifetime for organic hyperafterglow is proposed by isolating a conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized (CP) luminescence and energy acceptor with multi‐resonance effect into a rigid host. It is shown that the aggregation of chiral P‐containing binaphthyl promotes the generation of CP‐pRTP and afterglow with high brightness up to ≈50 cd m−2, while the simultaneous energy transfer and chirality transfer afford multi‐color organic hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of ≈90%, full‐width at half maxima of 31–39 nm, lifetime of 120–770 ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of ≈10−3. Also, excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, organic solvents, and aqueous solutions of strong acids and bases are observed. With these advantages, applications of chirality information encryption, afterglow grayscale imaging, and 3D high‐resolution afterglow models are realized, promoting significantly the fundamental understandings on the modulation of organic afterglow brightness and construction of high‐performance pRTP materials with advanced photophysical properties and applications.

<title>Abnormal Slow Phonon Dynamics Toward Prolonging Excited States Dynamics Enabled by Crystalline‐Assembling Donor–Acceptor Molecules</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Crystalline‐packing donor–acceptor molecular structures into dipolar crystals enables slow phonon dynamics from lattice vibrations when optical phonons develop mutual‐opposite phase relations. Through electron–phonon coupling, slow phonon dynamics interact with light‐emitting singlet charge‐transfer states containing contribution from triplets through triplet‐to‐singlet intersystem crossing, consequently leading to extended excited states dynamics with prolonged PL lifetime shown as super‐delayed fluorescence in dipolar organic crystals.








Abstract
Phonon dynamics are a critical factor to control the optical properties of excited states in light‐emitting materials. Here, we report an extremely slow relaxation of photoexcited lattice vibrations enabled by assembling the donor‐acceptor (D–A) molecules [2‐(9,9‐dimethylacridin‐10(9H)‐yl)‐9,9‐dimethyl‐9H‐thioxanthene 10,10‐dioxide], namely AC molecules, into dipolar crystal. By using photoexcitation‐modulated Raman spectroscopy, we find that the crystalline‐lattice vibrations monitored by Raman‐scattering laser beam of 785 nm demonstrate an un‐usual slow relaxation in the time scale of seconds after ceasing photoexcitation beam of 343 nm in such dipolar crystal. This presents extremely slow phonon dynamics enabled by crystalline‐assembling the D–A molecules into a dipolar crystal. Simultaneously, the photoluminescence (PL) exhibits a prolonged behavior, lasting 10 ms after ceasing photoexcitation in dipolar AC crystal. This phenomenon provides an experimental hypothesis that the slow phonon dynamics function as an important mechanism to unusually prolong excited states dynamics upon crystalline‐assembling the D–A molecules into dipolar crystal. This hypothesis can be verified by directly suppressing the phonon dynamics through freezing D–A molecular liquid into dipolar crystalline solid at 77 K to largely prolong the PL to 1 s‐ after removing photoexcitation. Clearly, crystalline‐assembling D–A molecules provide the necessary conditions to enable slow phonon dynamics toward prolonging excited states dynamics.

<title>Benchmarking Corrosion with Anionic Polarity Index for Stable and Fast Aqueous Batteries Even in Low‐Concentration Electrolyte</title>
<link>https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202501049?af=R</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Since the water‐induced corrosion in aqueous electrolytes, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, will have a very adverse impact on the lifespan and rate performance of aqueous batteries. Through theoretical simulation, a strategy of anionic polarity index is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water simultaneously, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Despite aqueous electrolyte endowing batteries with the merits of safe operation, low‐cost fabrication, and high ionic conductivity, water‐induced corrosion, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, adversely affects lifespan and rate capability. There is still a lack of selection criteria for benchmarking corrosion behavior qualitatively. Through theoretical simulation, an anionic polarity index (API) tactic is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water concomitantly, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries (ZABs). As proof of concept, a low‐cost zinc salt of 0.5 m zinc bis(4‐hydroxybenzenesulphonate) (Zn(HBS)2) with low‐API anion is prioritized. Combined in situ spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal that, even in a low‐concentration electrolyte, the low‐API anion reduces interfacial water in the inner Helmholtz plane, shielding the chemical water dissociation. Meanwhile, their entering into the solvation sheath of Zn2+ lowers the solvent‐separated ion pair, suppressing the electrochemical corrosion. The elaborated API‐screened zinc salt endows fast plating kinetics of 50 mA cm−2 (119.1 mV polarization), high coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, dendrite‐free cycling over 1600 h, and prolonged lifespan over 5000 cycles for the Zn‐V cell. The results provide new metrics that can benchmark the success of ZABs for large‐scale energy storage.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in liquid films achieve breakthrough vertical‐cavity surface‐emitting lasers across red, green, and blue spectra. By leveraging entropic ligands for ultrahigh solubility and integrating microfluidic cooling, this work overcomes thermal quenching, enabling stable lasing at MHz repetition rates. The platform unlocks customizable, solution‐processed lasers for tunable wavelengths and diverse applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (cQD) are heralded for their tunable bandgaps, solution‐processibility, and cost‐effectiveness, making them ideal candidates for lasing applications. However, previous cQD lasing demonstrations have largely depended on close‐packed solid‐state films, which are deemed essential to counteract the rapid decay of material gain. In this study, a novel approach is introduced utilizing “entropic ligands and solvent” to enhance the solubility of cQDs in solution. By achieving the necessary critical volume fraction for lasing, this strategy leads to the groundbreaking development of the first liquid‐state vertical‐cavity surface‐emitting lasers (VCSELs) based on cQDs across the blue and green spectrum, encompassing diverse material systems such as CdSe‐based and InP‐based cQDs. Furthermore, by integrating the liquid‐state VCSEL with a microfluidic channel, it is demonstrated that heat dissipation during intense excitation is pivotal for cQD lasing likely across various excitation modes—whether pulsed or continuous‐wave, optically or electrically‐pumped—and different media, including liquid and solid states. The research will lay the foundation for a new era of liquid‐state cQD lasers for specific occasions, distinguished by their customizable and largely‐variable wavelengths, compact form factors, diverse materials basis, and dependable performance.

<title>Self‐Oxygenating PROTAC Microneedle for Spatiotemporally‐Confined Protein Degradation and Enhanced Glioblastoma Therapy</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Self‐oxygenating PROTAC microneedle (MN) is engineered to circumvent the blood‐brain‐barrier (BBB) and achieve spatiotemporally‐confined bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4) protein degradation. PPT7 NPs are swiftly released for rapid cellular uptake, confining the region of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and ARV771 production upon 671 nm laser irradiation. BM NPs are continuously released for generating oxygen (O2) to alleviate tumor hypoxia. This PROTAC‐delivered MN significantly inhibits tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models.









Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive subtype of primary brain tumors, which marginally respond to standard chemotherapy due to the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) and the low tumor specificity of the therapeutics. Herein, a double‐layered microneedle (MN) patch is rationally engineered by integrating acid and light dual‐activatable PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) nanoparticles and self‐oxygenating BSA‐MnO2 (BM) nanoparticles for GBM treatment. The MN is administrated at the tumor site to locally deliver the PROTAC prodrug and BM nanoparticles. The PROTAC nanoparticles are rapidly released from the outer layer of the MN and specifically activated in the acidic intracellular environment of tumor cells. Subsequently, near‐infrared light activates the photosensitizer to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) through photodynamic therapy (PDT), thereby triggering spatiotemporally‐tunable degradation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4). The BM nanoparticles, in the inner layer of the MN, serve as an oxygen supply station, and counteracts tumor hypoxia by converting hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into oxygen (O2), thus promoting PDT and PROTAC activation. This PROTAC prodrug‐integrated MN significantly inhibits tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models. This study describes the first spatiotemporally‐tunable protein degradation strategy for highly efficient GBM therapy, potentially advancing precise therapy of other kinds of refractory brain tumors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
This research presents a novel class of multicompartment photonic pigments derived from vegetable oils, leveraging biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers to effectively mitigate Ostwald ripening in complex emulsion systems. Through the development of an innovative structural model, non‐iridescent pure red hues are achieved in photonic glass, enabling unprecedented versatility in chromatic engineering via an RGB three‐primary color mixing strategy.








Abstract
Non‐iridescent photonic glass pigments of block copolymers show great potential for sustainable structural coloration. However, the ability to create accurate RGB color mixtures for real‐world applications is limited by the prevalent use of non‐degradable, fossil oil‐derived components and the difficulty in achieving pure red hues. This work presents an alternative strategy for achieving more sustainable structural coloration by fabricating composite photonic pigments through controlled self‐assembly of water, vegetable oil, and biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in a complex emulsion system. The obtained photonic balls feature unprecedented multicompartment structures characterized by a short‐range ordered assembly of water nanodroplets stabilized by the BBCPs, along with oil droplets stabilized by these nanodroplets, which substantially enhances resistance to Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, a new structural model is introduced to eliminate disordered scattering, successfully creating a pure red structural color and overcoming a long‐standing limitation in versatile chromatic engineering.

Smart windows with anti‐UV, fast‐response, and thermally stable characteristics for all‐day modulation are crafted, demonstrating appealing stability and durability for practical building energy‐saving applications.








Abstract
Thermochromic smart windows offer energy‐saving potential through temperature‐responsive optical transmittance adjustments, yet face challenges in achieving anti‐UV radiation, fast response, and high‐temperature stability characteristics for long‐term use. Herein, the rational design of Hofmeister effect‐enhanced, nanoparticle‐shielded composite hydrogels, composed of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), poly(N,N‐dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAA), sodium sulfate, and polydopamine nanoparticles, for anti‐UV, fast‐response, and all‐day‐modulated smart windows is reported. Specifically, a three‐dimensional network of PDMAA is created as the supporting skeleton, markedly enhancing the thermal stability of pristine HPMC hydrogels. Sodium sulfate induces a Hofmeister effect, lowering the lower critical solution temperature to 32 °C while accelerating phase transition rates fivefold (30 s vs. 150 s). Intriguingly, small‐sized polydopamine nanoparticles simultaneously enable high luminous transmittance of 66.9% and outstanding anti‐UV capability. Additionally, the smart window showcases a high solar modulation (51.2%) and maintains a 10.2 °C temperature reduction versus a glass window during all‐day modulation applications. The design strategy is effective, opening up new avenues for manufacturing fast‐response and durable thermochromic smart windows for energy savings and emission reduction.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A mixed electrolyte (IL‐FB (1:5)) for aluminum ion batteries is synthesized by incorporating fluorobenzene into ionic liquid electrolyte. The IL‐FB (1:5) promotes mass transport, enabling cycling for 7500 h under high current density and capacity (8 mA cm−2, 8 mAh cm−2). IL‐FB (1:5) also exhibits significantly improved wetting ability with the polypropylene separator, guaranteeing 60% reduction in the cost of the AIB.








Abstract
The energy industry has taken notice of aluminum ion batteries (AIB) for their low cost, high safety, and high capacity. However, using the ionic liquid electrolyte results in the uneven Al electrodeposition and the reliance on expensive glass fiber separators, due to the sluggish mass transport and low wettability for the polypropylene separator. Herein, a mixed electrolyte is introduced by incorporating the co‐solvent fluorobenzene into the traditional AlCl3/1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid, in which the fluorobenzene (FB) mitigates electrostatic interactions between ions and facilitates the ion diffusion. The optimization principle for the mixed electrolyte is proposed based on maximizing the mass transportation, as indicated by the limiting current density. The optimized mixed electrolyte IL‐FB (1:5) offers the highest limiting current density of 12 mA cm−2, highly reversible plate/stripe of Al, and thus stable cycling for 7500 h with the high current density and capacity (8 mA cm−2, 8 mAh cm−2). Furthermore, IL‐FB (1:5) also shows enhanced wettability for the polypropylene separator. The AIB with the polypropylene separator, exhibiting 60% decrease in cost, is achieved for the first time by using IL‐FB (1:5), presenting a crucial step toward the initial practical application.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
A nonpolar soluble 2D perovskite, noted as TPA2PbI4, is developed to construct controllable mixed‐dimensional perovskite heterojunctions without solid reactions with the initial 3D perovskite films. This strategy improves both the performance of small‐area perovskite solar cells and large‐area perovskite modules, promoting 30 cm × 30 cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules to achieve a certified efficiency of 22.06%.








Abstract
Constructing mixed‐dimensional heterojunctions through ion exchange between functional organic ammonium halides and the already‐deposited bulk 3D perovskite films is a widely adopted strategy to effectively passivate and stabilize perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Such process poses challenges in precisely controlling the composition and distribution of the heterojunctions across the film, in particular for large‐area applications. Here, a soft 2D perovskite based on tetrapheptyl‐ammonium iodide (TPAI), noted as TPA2PbI4 is reported. It is the first‐reported nonpolar readily soluble 2D perovskite, leading to highly compact and oriented perovskite layers. In addition, this nonpolar soluble TPA2PbI4 is beneficial to universally construct thickness‐controllable mixed‐dimensional perovskite heterojunctions to suppress the non‐radiative recombination and promote charge‐carrier transfer on all the FA‐, MA‐ and CsPbI3 PSCs. Such a unique strategy is also suitable for upscaling fabrication, demonstrated by 30 cm × 30 cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules with a certified efficiency of 22.06%.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
By optimizing building blocks and linking modes, a dimeric acceptor, named DY‐FL, is innovatively designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the efficient molecular design strategy, DY‐FL‐based binary OSCs rendered an efficiency of 19.78%. Importantly, DY‐FL‐based devices showcased significantly enhanced photo/thermal stability in comparison to small molecule acceptor‐based OSCs.








Abstract
The development of organic solar cells (OSCs) with high efficiency and stability is highly desirable to facilitate its commercial applications. Although dimeric acceptors with distinctive advantages have been widely studied, high‐performance binary OSCs based on such molecules have rarely been achieved. In this work, a new dimeric acceptor (DY‐FL) is constructed by simultaneously optimizing the linking sites and units, as well as the building blocks. Thanks to the effective molecular design, DY‐FL provides improved molecular stacking for fibrous morphology with favorable exciton/charge dynamics. Consequently, DY‐FL‐based binary OSCs render a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78%, representing a record‐breaking efficiency for binary OSCs based on dimeric acceptors. Importantly, DY‐FL‐based devices display significantly enhanced operational stability under external stimuli such as light and heat, in comparison to their small molecule acceptor (Y‐F)‐based counterpart. These findings highlight the significance of building blocks and linking modes, providing insight into the effective molecular design strategy of dimeric acceptors for state‐of‐the‐art OSCs.

<title>Thermal Processing Creates Water‐Stable PEDOT:PSS Films for Bioelectronics</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Instead of using chemical cross–linkers, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films for bioelectronics become water‐stable after a simple heat treatment. The heat treatment is compatible with a range of rigid and elastomeric substrates and films are stable in vivo for >20 days. 2D and 3D PEDOT:PSS structures can be patterned by delivering heat with a focused femtosecond laser.









Abstract
Organic mixed ionic‐electronic conductors have emerged as a key material for the development of bioelectronic devices due to their soft mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and high volumetric capacitance. In particular, PEDOT:PSS has become a choice material because it is highly conductive, easily processible, and commercially available. However, PEDOT:PSS is dispersible in water, leading to delamination of films when exposed to biological environments. For this reason, chemical cross–linking agents such as (3‐glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) are used to stabilize PEDOT:PSS films in water, but at the cost of decreased electrical performance. Here, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films become water‐stable by simply baking at high temperatures (>150 °C) for a short time (≈ 2 min). It is shown that heat‐treated PEDOT:PSS films are as stable as their chemically‐cross–linked counterparts, with their performance maintained for >20 days both in vitro and in vivo. The heat‐treated films eliminate electrically insulating cross–linkers, resulting in a 3× increase in volumetric capacitance. Applying thermal energy using a focused femtosecond laser enables direct patterning of 3D PEDOT:PSS microstructures. The thermal treatment method is compatible with a wide range of substrates and is readily substituted into existing workflows for manufacturing devices, enabling its rapid adoption in the field of bioelectronics.

<title>Incorporating Ordered Indium Sites into Rhodium for Ultra‐Low Potential Electrocatalytic Conversion of Ethylene Glycol to Glycolic Acid</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
Incorporating ordered oxyphilic In sites into Rh to form RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) facilitates the ultra‐low‐potential electrooxidation of ethylene glycol into the high‐value chemical, glycolic acid. The synthesized RhIn IMCs also exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Using RhIn IMCs as bifunctional catalysts, a two‐electrode system is established for ethylene glycol electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production.








Abstract
The upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)‐derived ethylene glycol (EG) to glycolic acid (GA, a biodegradable polymer monomer) via electrocatalysis not only produces valuable chemicals but also mitigates plastic pollution. However, the current reports for electrooxidation of EG‐to‐GA usually operate at reaction potentials of >1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), much higher than the theoretical potential (0.065 V vs RHE), resulting in substantial energy wastage. Herein, body‐centered cubic RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) anchored on carbon support (denoted as RhIn/C) are synthesized, which shows excellent performance for the EG‐to‐GA with an onset potential of only 0.35 V vs RHE, lower than the values reported in current literature. The catalyst also possesses satisfactory GA selectivity (85% at 0.65 V vs RHE). Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrate that RhIn IMCs enhance the adsorption of EG and OH−, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species and thereby improving catalytic performance. RhIn/C also exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, ensuring that it can be used as a bifunctional catalyst in the two‐electrode system for EG electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production. This work opens new avenues for reducing the energy consumption of electrocatalytic upcycling of PET‐derived EG and clean energy production.
